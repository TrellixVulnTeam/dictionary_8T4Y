The one-way ANOVA with repeated measures was conducted to compare the mean sum scores of the three factors (expected consequences, individual responsibility, professional responsibility). There was a significant effect of factor, Wilks’ Lambda = 0.3, F [2,63] = 73.9, p < .001, η
 
Critical observation of groundnut crop area map developed from satellite imagery (
 
We used two GCMs, one optimistic (HadGEM 2-ES) and another pessimistic (GFDL-ESM2M) to study the impact of climate change on groundnut yields under RCP 8.5 during the mid-century period. The summary of the projected percentage change in groundnut yields between the baseline (1980–2009) and the mid-century future climate (2040–2069) are presented in 
 
We tested incorporating yield boosting genetic traits by increasing maximum leaf photosynthesis rate, partitioning daily growth to pods, and seed filling duration compared with the baseline cultivar (JL24) as an adaptation option. Incorporating these traits in JL-24 resulted in increased yields under both the GCMs. However, the response was more significant under HadGEM 2-ES in five out of six FPUs. The average yield benefit with yield boosting cultivars under both GCMs across FPUs were 17.1 and 18.1% with GFDL-ESM2M and HadGEM 2-ES respectively (Supplementary Table 1).
Groundnut in India is grown under rainfed conditions in most of the groundnut growing areas. However, most of the time, the crop may experience dry spells during pod filling. Providing one critical irrigation under these conditions will be beneficial for crop growth. We tried applying one critical irrigation at 60 DAS as an adaptation option. This resulted in increases in yield under both GCMs and in all the FPUs. However, the response was spatially different across different FPUs. Yield gains from critical irrigation were 24.9% and 34.8% under HadGEM 2-ES and GFDL-ESM2M, respectively in the Krishna basin (supplementary Table 1). The responses were lowest in the Ganges and Luni basins under HadGEM 2-ES. Luni basin was lowest under both HadGEM 2-ES and GFDL-ESM2M GCMs. This underlines the need for location-specific adaptation options.
As the simulation study clearly showed spatially different responses with yield boost and critical irrigation, we tried a simulation of combining both CI and YB using future climate data. The responses were very encouraging across FPUs. The highest response to the combination was observed in the Krishna basin under both the GCMs, with responses ranging between 27% and 54.2% under GFDL-ESM2M and 19.6% and 44.9% with HadGEM 2-ES GCMs (supplementary Table 1). The spatial distribution of yield benefits under various adaptation options across groundnut growing regions are depicted in 
 
Projected supply, demand and net trade of groundnut in India from 2010 to 2050 under a no climate change scenario are presented in 
 
We took both climate change induced effects and market effects on groundnut yields are going to be affected by climate change even the market effects were also taken into consideration. When market effects based on the economic model results are factored in, there is a reduction of more than 50% in the negative impacts on groundnut yields under both climate scenarios in the Ganges, Indus, and Tapti basins (
 
Total annual groundnut production under the baseline scenario is between 23 metric tons (MT) and 354 MT in 2050 across various Indian FPUs Under the HadGEM 2-ES scenario, groundnut production is projected to be higher than the baseline in all FPUs (6.1 to 16.1%), except the Ganges basin (−0.6%) in 2050. Similarly, under the GFDL-ESM2M scenario, production is projected to fall in the Ganges (−11.6%), Indus (−10.5%) and Tapti (−1.3%) FPUs and increase in all other FPUs compared to the baseline in 2050 (
 
Groundnut yields increased under all adaptation options. To the greatest extent, under the adaptation scenario in which, higher-yielding cultivars were clubbed with critical irrigation in all FPUs in 2050 compared to baseline under the HadGEM 2-ES scenario. Yield increases ranged between 6% in the Ganges basin to 38% in the Krishna basin. Adopting high-yielding cultivars alone is projected to increase yields in all the basins but to a lesser extent, ranging between 6% in the Ganges basin and 27% in the Godavari basin compared to baseline. Providing one critical irrigation is also projected to increase yields in all FPUs in 2050, except in the Ganges basin under the HadGEM 2-ES scenario. However, the projected increase is low in both the adaptation options and ranges between 6% to 26% in the Tapti and Krishna basins, respectively (
 
Groundnut production under the HadGEM 2-ES scenario is higher under all adaptation options. To the greatest extent under the adaptation scenario in which higher yielding cultivars are used combination with critical irrigation in all FPUs compared to the baseline scenario. The increases in production range between 9% in the Ganges basin to 66% in the Krishna basin in 2050 compared to baseline. Using high yielding cultivars is also projected to increase production in all the basins in 2050 but to a lesser extent, ranging between 9% in the Ganges basin to 46% in the Godavari basin. Similarly, one irrigation during crop growth period projected to result in increased yields in all FPUs except for the Ganges basin in 2050 under the HadGEM 2-ES scenario. The magnitude of increase is projected to be lesser than the other adaptation options and ranges between 10% in the Tapti basin to 44% in the Krishna basin (
 
Groundnut yields increased under all adaptation options. The highest increase is in the option of combining high yielding cultivars with critical irrigation in all FPUs compared to baseline in 2050, under the GFDL-ESM2M scenario, similar to the HadGEM 2-ES scenario. The increase ranged between 11% in the Tapti basin to 23% in the Krishna basin, which had the lowest average yield compared to all other FPUs. Adopting high yielding cultivars is projected to result in increased yields in all the basins except the Ganges and Indus basins but to a lesser extent, ranging between 5% in the Tapti basin and 11% in the Godavari basin compared to baseline. The application of critical irrigation during the pod filling stage for groundnut grown under rainfed conditions is projected to result in increased yields in all FPUs except for the Ganges and Indus basins compared in 2050. The increase is projected to be lesser than both the other adaptation options and ranges between 3% in the Tapti basin and 15% in the Krishna basin. None of the adaptation options are estimated to improve yields than baseline in 2050 in the Ganges and Indus basins (
 
Groundnut production in India was higher under all adaptation options in all the FPUs with the exception of the Ganges and Indus basins in 2050 under the GFDL-ESM2M scenario. The increase in production ranged between 18% in the Tapti basin and 39% in the Krishna basin compared to baseline in 2050. Adopting to higher yielding cultivars is projected to increase production in all the basins, but at a lower extent ranging between 8% in the Tapti basin and 19% in the Godavari basin compared to baseline. Providing one irrigation is also projected to result in increased yields in all the FPUs except for the Ganges basin compared to baseline. The scale of increase is projected to be lesser than both the other adaptation options and ranges between 6% in the Tapti basin and 24% in the Krishna basin (
 
Changes in groundnut production in India lead to price fluctuations. All the adaptation scenarios allow producers to capture a greater share of the final consumer price. This leads to a situation where producer prices in India increase by between one to 3% under the GFDL-ESM2M scenario and by between four to 7% compared to baseline prices by 2050. This is seen as a natural consequence of adaptation and a decline in the global price of groundnut between 0.4% and 0.8% under the GFDL-ESM2M scenario and between 1.2% and 2% under the HadGEM 2-ES scenario compared to the baseline by 2050 (
 
We identified 120 original research studies that examined mental health in the context of climate change-related exposures (
 
The geographies which represented the most original research studies were Australia (
 
Although we searched for studies from 2001 onwards, we did not identify any published before 2007. There was an overall increasing trend in the number of studies between 2007 and 2020, with the highest number in 2020 (34 studies) (
 
The following sections provide a narrative summary of the original research corresponding to the WHO framework.
A small number of studies (
 
Barriers to implementing strategies to adapt to combat the agricultural impacts of climate change have resulted in negative mental health outcomes among subsistence farmers in Burkina Faso [
 
Finally, an exploratory study surveying people affected by widespread public safety power shutoffs (PSPS) to reduce the risk of wildfires in California found that while people were mostly supportive of PSPS as an adaptation measure, it was associated with poorer physical and mental health [
 
Very few studies (
 
A study designed to develop and validate indices of adaptation to flooding found that people who perceived a risk of flooding in their home in the next five years adopted more preventative behaviours and adaptation behaviours than those who perceived little or no risk at all. Additionally, people who felt more adverse effects of flooding on their physical or mental health tended to adopt more adaptive behaviours than those who felt little or no adverse effects on their health [
 
We did not find any studies that assessed the costs associated with climate change impacts on mental health. However, one study from the United Kingdom found that a social prescribing service for mental health—a service model which supports people to access healthcare resources and psychosocial support, considered to hold potential for reduced cost and carbon-footprint—was associated with reduced financial costs but an increased carbon footprint per patient. However, none of the differences between groups reached statistical significance [
 
Overall, the studies identified in this review were of sound (fair to good) quality. Out of the 93 studies that were quality assessed, 75% were rated good, 23% fair and 2% poor. It is important to note that we found significant variability in how environmental exposures were measured. Among the quantitative studies, we identified two types of approaches to measure exposure to climate-sensitive environmental hazards: (i) self-reported exposures using questionnaires and interviews (note that all qualitative studies used self-reported exposures) and (ii) interpolated exposures using external sources of data.
Fifty-two studies relied on self-reported information to assign a climate change-related exposure to study participants. We found large variability across the survey questions used to capture self-reported exposures, as no standardised questionnaire exists (in contrast to self-reported mental health outcomes) to measure subjective experience regarding climate-sensitive environmental hazards. Specifically, each study in our selected sample used a different question or metric to capture the environmental exposure. Such variability makes the evaluation of the robustness of used tools and the comparison between studies difficult. To the best of our knowledge, we did not identify any self-reported tool regarding the exposures of interest that were validated beforehand.
In addition, 48 studies relied on interpolated exposures using various types of available meteorological data sources. Some studies used meteorological data (mostly precipitation and temperature) from monitoring stations in the area of interest, often retrieved from the national or regional bureau of meteorology or data service centres. Other studies relied on remote sensing data from various satellite products with reanalysis, including the PRISM Climate Group [
 
The majority of studies (
 
The most commonly examined environmental exposure in relation to health risk was temperature (
 
Three studies from Australia found associations between heat and mental health outcomes; however, the evidence was inconsistent. For example, Ding et al., report that an increase in temperature and humidity affects psychological distress, independently from pre-existing depression or anxiety [
 
Several studies from Asia found that fluctuating temperatures influenced mental health and well-being, impacting productivity and livelihoods [
 
Temperature also affected mental health and well-being in several studies conducted in North America. Noelke et al. reported that temperatures above daily averages reduced positive emotions like happiness, increased negative emotions like anger and stress, and increased fatigue [
 
Drought was another frequently studied climate exposure (
 
A longitudinal cohort study showed elevated drought-related stress and psychological distress (as measured by the K10) among farmers [
 
One multi-country study has looked at rainfall as a climate-related exposure and has reported that the highest prevalence of mood disorders is observed in countries characterised by small variations across monthly rainfall and high levels of rainfall [
 
Two studies from North America examined the impacts of wildfires on mental health. Qualitative interviews of people purposively sampled to include a broad cross-section of backgrounds and experiences from a severe 2014 wildfire season in the North-West Territories of Canada, in the context of climate change, reported how experiences of evacuation and isolation, as well as feelings of fear, stress, and uncertainty, contributed to acute and long-term negative impacts on mental and emotional well-being [
 
A household study conducted one year after the Wallow Fire in Arizona, United States, concluded higher solastalgia, a term used to indicate distress caused by environmental change (measured using a scale adapted from [
 
Several studies examined the mental health impacts of flooding. An Australian study qualitatively explored individuals’ experiences from rural communities, concluding that the threat of drought and flood are intertwined and contributed to decreased well-being from stress, anxiety, loss, and fear [
 
In addition to the tangible mental health impacts related to exposure to specific climate change-related events, studies have reported psychological impacts of perceived risks associated with climate change [
 
Symptom scales were commonly used to examine mental health outcomes. Distress (
 
Alternatively, many studies utilised routinely collected administrative data. Psychiatric hospital admissions associated with temperature and heat waves were frequently studied (
 
Mortality has also been found to be influenced by high ambient temperatures for people living with mental illness and neurological conditions. A study of health outcome data from Adelaide, South Australia, for 1993–2006, has demonstrated that mortality attributed to mental and behavioural disorders increased during heat waves in the 65- to 74-years age group and in persons with psychosis [
 
Temperature has also been associated with self-harm and suicide rates [
 
Studies attempting to quantify the burden of mental disorders attributable to climate change are sparse. One study from South Korea has estimated the burden of disease related to climate change for a range of conditions and climate-related measures, including PTSD, as an outcome of disasters [
 
We identified a body of research related to populations and contexts that are anticipated to be more vulnerable to climate change and its mental health impacts. People taking certain psychotropic medications (including hypnotics, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics) are at increased risk of heatstroke and death as a result of high temperatures, possibly due to disruptions in thermoregulation triggered by some psychotropic medications [
 
According to the results of a national survey of Australian children aged 6–11, higher temperatures may impact children’s mental health [
 
Qualitative studies reporting the unique mental health impacts of climate change on Inuit communities in Canada have described a loss of place-based solace, land-based activities such as hunting, and cultural identity due to changing weather and local landscapes [
 
A study from Ethiopia, a low-income country that has a high dependency on the local environment to meet basic human and animal needs, demonstrated that seasonal environmental changes related to water security expose populations to significant emotional distress [
 
There were eight studies related to interventions; however, these were primarily exploratory and qualitative and focused on health professionals and community settings, and did not provide clear support for any one specific intervention.
One study looked at the health and social service responses to the long-term mental health impacts of a flood event. It concluded that sustained recovery interventions rooted in local knowledge and interdisciplinary action were required and that there are unintended consequences related to psychosocial interventions that can incite complex emotions and impact psychosocial recovery [
 
A study from rural Australia has described how a community development model, incorporating elements of health promotion, education, and early intervention, was accepted and considered effective in helping communities build capacity and resilience in the face of chronic drought-related hardship [
 
Two studies explored the relationship between pro-environmental behaviour and mental health in terms of awareness of health risks and potential health co-benefits. Results from a survey in China indicated that residents’ health-risk perception is positively affected by climate-change information. Additionally, perceiving climate change as detrimental to mental health was shown to influence a residents’ attitude and intention to take environmental action more than physical health-risk perception [
 
Finally, a study exploring health perceptions in climate-driven migrants found that emphasis was placed on the importance of mental health, indicating that mental health interventions could be effective in this population [

Regarding the geographical focus of systematic reviews, most of the included studies (n=68; 72%) had a global focus or no specified geographical limitations and therefore included studies published anywhere in the world. The remaining systematic reviews either targeted certain countries (n=12) (1 for each Australia, Germany, Iran, India, Ethiopia, Malaysia, Nepal, New Zealand and 2 reviews focused on China and the USA), continents (n=5) (3 focused on Europe and 2 on Asia), or regions according to geographical location (n=6) (1 focused on Sub-Saharan Africa, 1 on Eastern Mediterranean countries, 1 on Tropical countries, and 3 focused on the Arctic), or according to the country’s level of income (n=3) (2 on low to middle income countries, 1 on high income countries).
Regarding specific populations of interest, most of the systematic reviews did not define a specific population of interest (n=69; 73%). For the studies that specified a population of interest (n=25; 26.6%), the most frequent populations were children (n=7) and workers (n=6), followed by vulnerable or susceptible populations more generally (n=4), the elderly (n=3), pregnant people (n=2), people with disabilities or chronic illnesses (n=2) and rural populations (n=1).
We assessed studies for quality according to our revised AMSTAR-2. Complete scores for each article and each item are available in 
 
Regarding climate impacts, we identified 5 mutually exclusive categories, with 13 publications targeting more than one category of climate impacts: (1) meteorological (n=71 papers) (eg, temperature, heat waves, humidity, precipitation, sunlight, wind, air pressure), (2) extreme weather (n=24) (eg, water-related, floods, cyclones, hurricanes, drought), (3) air quality (n=7) (eg, air pollution and wildfire smoke exposure), (4) general (n=5), and (5) other (n=3). Although heat waves could be considered an extreme weather event, papers investigating heat waves’ impact on health were classified in the meteorological impact category, since some of these studies treated them with high temperature. ‘General’ climate impacts included articles that did not specify climate change impacts but stated general climate change as their focus. ‘Other’ climate impacts included studies investigating other effects indirectly related to climate change (eg, impact of environmental contaminants) or general environmental risk factors (eg, environmental hazards, sanitation and access to clean water.)
We identified 10 categories to describe the health outcomes studied by the systematic reviews, and 29 publications targeted more than one category of health outcomes: (1) infectious diseases (n=41 papers) (vector borne, food borne and water borne), (2) mortality (n=32), (3) respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological (n=23), (4) healthcare systems (n=16), 5) mental health (n=13), (6) pregnancy and birth (n=11), 7) nutritional (n=9), (8) skin diseases and allergies (n=8), (9) occupational health and injuries (n=6) and (10) other health outcomes (n=17) (eg, sleep, arthritis, disability-adjusted life years, non-occupational injuries, etc)

 
For studies investigating meteorological impacts on health, the three most common health outcomes studied were impacts on (1) infectious diseases (n=35), (2) mortality (n=24) and (3) respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological outcomes (n=17). Extreme weather event studies most commonly reported health outcomes related to (1) infectious diseases (n=14), (2) mental health outcomes (n=9) and (3) nutritional outcomes (n=6) and other health outcomes (eg, injuries, sleep) (n=6). Studies focused on the impact of air quality were less frequent and explored mostly health outcomes linked to (1) respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological outcomes (n=6), (2) mortality (n=5) and (3) pregnancy and birth outcomes (n=3).
Most reviews suggest a deleterious impact of climate change on multiple adverse health outcomes, with some associations being explored and/or supported with consistent findings more often than others. Some reviews also report conflicting findings or an absence of association between the climate impact and health outcome studied (see 
 
Notable findings of health outcomes according to climate impact include the following. For meteorological factors (n=71), temperature and humidity are the variables most often studied and report the most consistent associations with infectious diseases and respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological outcomes. Temperature is also consistently associated with mortality and healthcare service use. Some associations are less frequently studied, but remain consistent, including the association between some meteorological factors (eg, temperature and heat) and some adverse mental health outcomes (eg, hospital admissions for mental health reasons, suicide, exacerbation of previous mental health conditions), and the association between heat and adverse occupational outcomes and some adverse birth outcomes. Temperature is also associated with adverse nutritional outcomes (likely via crop production and food insecurity) and temperature and humidity are associated with some skin diseases and allergies. Some health outcomes are less frequently studied, but studies suggest an association between temperature and diabetes, impaired sleep, cataracts, heat stress, heat exhaustion and renal diseases.
Extreme weather events (n=24) are consistently associated with mortality, some mental health outcomes (eg, distress, anxiety, depression) and adverse nutritional outcomes (likely via crop production and food insecurity). Some associations are explored less frequently, but these studies suggest an association between drought and respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes (likely via air quality), between extreme weather events and an increased use of healthcare services and some adverse birth outcomes (likely due to indirect causes, such as experiencing stress). Some health outcomes are less frequently studied, but studies suggest an association between extreme weather events and injuries, impaired sleep, oesophageal cancer and exacerbation of chronic illnesses. There are limited and conflicting findings for the association between extreme weather events and infectious diseases, as well as for certain mental health outcomes (eg, suicide and substance abuse). At times, different types of extreme weather events (eg, drought vs flood) led to conflicting findings for some health outcomes (eg, mental health outcomes, infectious diseases), but for other health outcomes, the association was consistent independently of the extreme weather event studied (eg, mortality, healthcare service use and nutritional outcomes).
The impact of air quality on health (n=7) was less frequently studied, but the few studies exploring this association report consistent findings regarding an association with respiratory-specific mortality, adverse respiratory outcomes and an increase in healthcare service use. There is limited evidence regarding the association between air quality and cardiovascular outcomes, limited and inconsistent evidence between wildfire smoke exposure and adverse birth outcomes, and no association is found between exposure to wildfire smoke and increase in use of health services for mental health reasons. Only one review explored the impact of wildfire smoke exposure on ophthalmic outcomes, and it suggests that it may be associated with eye irritation and cataracts.
Reviews which stated climate change as their general focus and did not specify the climate impact(s) under study were less frequent (n=5), but they suggest an association between climate change and pollen allergies in Europe, increased use of healthcare services, obesity, skin diseases and allergies and an association with disability-adjusted life years. Reviews investigating the impact of other climate-related factors (n=3) show inconsistent findings concerning the association between environmental pollutant and adverse birth outcomes, and two reviews suggest an association between environmental risk factors and pollutants and childhood stunting and occupational diseases.
Most reviews concluded by calling for more research, noting the limitations observed among the studies included in their reviews, as well as limitations in their reviews themselves. These limitations included, among others, some systematic reviews having a small number of publications,
 
Previous authors also discussed the important challenge related to exploring the relationship between climate change and health. Not only is it difficult to explore the potential causal relationship between climate change and health, mostly due to methodological challenges, but there are also a wide variety of complex causal factors that may interact to determine health outcomes. Therefore, the possible causal mechanisms underlying these associations were at times still unknown or uncertain and the impacts of some climate factors were different according to geographical location and specificities of the context. Nonetheless, some reviews offered potential explanations for the climate-health association, with the climate factor at times, having a direct impact on health (eg, flooding causing injuries, heat causing dehydration) and in other cases, having an indirect impact (eg, flooding causing stress which in turn may cause adverse birth outcomes, heat causing difficulty concentrating leading to occupational injuries.)
Overall, participants critically evaluated the materials and they expressed both positive and negative responses, and generally participants in high climate concern groups discussed more positive responses while those in low climate concern groups were more negative and critical. Themes that emerged to describe participants’ responses are presented first according to each material separately, followed by themes emerging in the discussion of comparison of materials. Differences and similarities between high and low climate concern groups are highlighted throughout.
When reading the article, many people across all six groups expressed that the specific statistics and facts about Lyme disease were something that stood out to them, either as new information or something they thought was interesting and compelling, including: the rate of spread of blacklegged ticks per year; the increase in cases of Lyme disease; the fact that blacklegged ticks were not previously in the Prairies; and the definition of Lyme disease. When asked what the key message of the article was, the majority of people (in 4 out of 6 groups) said it was the connection between Lyme disease and climate change, while a minority (2 out of 6 groups) said it was primarily that Lyme disease and ticks are increasing, and there is a need to adapt.
Across all three low climate change concern groups, there were many people in each group who remained skeptical of the link between climate change and Lyme disease after reading the article. Many said that the article did not show proof that the rise in Lyme disease is related to climate change, while others said they simply “don’t buy it”. In one low climate concern group, someone declared that the article was “propaganda,” and in another someone noticed that amongst the peer-reviewed literature there were also news articles and grey literature cited, and said that the article was not credible because of its sources. Among those in the high climate concern groups, some people wanted more information on the implications of the connection between action on climate change and Lyme disease. As one participant in Winnipeg stated: “Do you think reducing emissions–which I agree is needed and a must–do you think it’s going to change anything about Lyme disease? Even if we stop producing any emissions tomorrow, [the ticks] are here.”
Many participants across groups reported enjoying the video and finding it engaging. A key message identified was that blacklegged ticks and Lyme disease are not abating and thus people must learn to adapt and take preventative measures. Other key information reported was how Lyme disease is spreading, how ticks survive in warmer weather, and the increasing risk in Manitoba. As one Winnipeg participant described their key takeaway: “Lyme disease is growing a lot faster than I thought. It’s going to become more and more of a threat.” People found the visuals particularly helpful, such as the images of the bullseye rash common after a tick bite, the blacklegged ticks themselves, and researchers sampling for ticks in suitable habitat. People in several groups also commented that they liked the story element; as one Brandon participant described, “It was good how they went from… a personal story and then kind of backing it up with some of the research.” The preferred messengers from the video were the community member who had contracted Lyme disease, the medical doctor who actively sees Lyme patients, and the field researcher who sampled ticks, as opposed to the scientists in labs and offices.
People in four groups reported having more of an emotional reaction to the video, while one participant said the video had a more positive valence and “wasn’t as much doom and gloom.” When asked whether the video was about Lyme disease, climate change or both, generally the consensus was that it was more about Lyme disease. Only one group had several people comment on the link between the spreading of Lyme disease and climate change.
Many of the same skeptical critiques were brought up for the video as with the article amongst the three low climate concern groups. Many people across all three groups mentioned that there was not sufficient proof that the tick spread was related to climate change, though people were not able to articulate the additional information they would require. Many people restated their original views, saying things such as “animals are just moving,” “the weather hasn’t changed that much” or “it is a cycle.” A few people admitted that they would not watch the video if they came across it because they did not find it interesting or informative.
Participants had a more negative reaction to the maps overall. Across all six groups, people identified the key message of the maps was that temperatures are getting warmer and things are going to get worse. Some people pointed out that this will lead to an increase in the spread of ticks and Lyme disease, but for many that was not immediately clear. Generally, people agreed that the main message of the map was that climate change is getting worse, while several said it was the link between climate change and Lyme disease. People in several groups commented on the intensity of the red colouring, with one participant commenting, “When you make the province of Manitoba look like it’s wearing a Calgary Flames [hockey] jersey, it looks scary.”
There were many criticisms of the maps, with people in every group saying that the language used in the map caption was too complex and technical for an average person. Participants expressed not understanding climate models and projections, degree days, high carbon emissions scenarios (RCP 8.5), and down-scaled climate data. Another point of confusion was the timeframes of the past, near future, and far future used on the maps; many people in five of the groups wanted to see the present represented (i.e. 2019). People in two of the groups mentioned that the map of the far future (2051–2080) had no effect on them because it was not relatable. One person mentioned, “…by 2080, I’m sorry, I’m not going to be around. How can I relate to that last picture?” Additionally, some people in three of the groups took issue with the use of climate projections, suggesting that they are not accurate or reliable. One person described scientific projections as “guessing”. As another person mentioned, “Well…it’s such a huge timeframe and as I said, you look at the history of forecasting weather… they’re accurate to a degree, but never exact. And so, I look at this and okay, well, yes, they are true to a degree, but how accurate?” A few people across two of the groups simply did not understand the map at all, with one stating “It’s a pretty picture. It looks like it’s getting worse, but we don’t understand why.”
There was also mention across three groups (of both high and low climate concern) that the map was “fear mongering” or trying to scare people by making the changes look extreme. One person in Winnipeg even suggested that Lyme disease was being used to incite fear about climate change: “It makes me think more that these [researchers] are just using Lyme disease to scare you about climate change.”
A summary of common strengths and criticisms for the three materials are found in 
 
When asked which of the three materials had the most impact or was the most effective, the majority of people in five of the six groups clearly felt that it was the video. Across four groups, people mentioned that they liked the video better because they were audio-visual learners, while others in two groups said it had more of an impact because there were “real people” in the video. Interestingly, even the more climate skeptical participants preferred the video, as one Brandon participant explained: “I’m not necessarily a hundred percent onboard with the scientific data that you’re spelling out there, but the anecdotal situations on how somebody actually contracts the disease, and to look for that, hits me a lot better.” Several people suggested the video would be the best medium to reach younger audiences who are online frequently, though it was suggested that the tool needed to be shorter in length.
A few people in two groups said that the article was the most effective material, explaining that they generally enjoy reading so they were most drawn to this format. The map was most commonly identified as the least effective material. This was brought up across all three of the low climate concern groups, with many claiming that it was missing data, was “fear-mongering,” “alarmist,” or looked like “propaganda,” with one participant even saying it should be “thrown in the garbage.” Compared to the video, the map was seen as less credible and believable.
When asked if any of the materials changed their attitudes, across all four groups outside of Winnipeg, many people mentioned that none of the materials changed their attitudes towards Lyme disease, climate change, or the link between them. In some cases, this was because they expressed already having this knowledge, while for others the information was not sufficient to convince them of the link between Lyme disease and climate change. One person in a low climate concern group mentioned that they became less worried about ticks after watching the video.
Others reported that the materials did change their attitude towards the issues, by making them more aware of the growing risks. For these participants, there was a range of responses to whether they would change their behaviours as a result of their shift in attitude. Some said they still did not perceive a big enough risk from Lyme disease to change their behaviour, while others said they would take more precautions against tick bites, particularly with children and pets. Similar to attitudes, many people, particularly in rural areas, expressed already having preventative habits, such as checking for ticks, dressing accordingly, and using bug spray.
The materials were commonly criticized for having an unclear purpose or “muddled message.” In four groups, participants were confused about the purpose of the materials, whether it was to motivate people to act on climate change or to adopt preventative behaviours in response to the increasing health risks from blacklegged ticks. As one participant articulated: “What’s the purpose?… Are you trying to activate people on a climate change question, or are you trying to activate them to take better care of themselves health-wise?”
People from high and low climate concern groups suggested either separating the Lyme disease and climate change messages, or prioritizing one so that there is a clear focus. Multiple people said that if Lyme disease is the focus, then climate change should be excluded or minimized in the materials so as not to lose interest from climate skeptical audiences. A participant from one of the high climate concern groups explained: “I think most of us here agree with climate change, [but] a lot of people out there don’t, so as soon as you try to frame this as ‘you better be scared of climate change because of ticks’ you’re going to have people ignore your information on ticks.” Others noted that if climate change is the main focus, then the materials should focus on other impacts because “there’s bigger issues than…ticks with climate change”. A few people argued that it is important to discuss both Lyme disease and climate change together to give context to why the ticks are spreading and increase awareness of climate impacts. As one person expressed, “I think it’s helpful that the climate change part of it is in there…it helps us understand why it’s increasing or where it’s coming from.”
