 <caption>
  <p>GC-MS chromatogram of the partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAAs) from the pectic fractions (here, P3 as an example) after carboxyl reduction of the uronic acids and subsequent methylation, hydrolysis, reduction and acetylation. The glycosidic linkages were assigned based on the EI-MS spectra and retention time of polysaccharide standards.</p>
