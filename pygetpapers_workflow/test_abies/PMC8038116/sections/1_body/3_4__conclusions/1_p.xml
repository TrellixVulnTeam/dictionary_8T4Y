<p>Here, we provide a structural model for the macromolecular architecture of the pectin populations extracted from the bark of 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> using pressurized hot water extraction. The size fractionation of the extracted pectins by preparative size exclusion chromatography, followed by monosaccharide and glycosidic linkage analysis, revealed the structural characteristics of the backbone and side chains of the different pectic domains. Different pectic fractions were fractionated from spruce bark, with molecular weights ranging between 5000 and 150,000 Da. The pectins consist of a complex mixture of polysaccharide domains with distinct macromolecular topologies (e.g., hyperbranched and linear domains). The high-molar mass pectic fractions contained mainly hyperbranched RG-I domains with a large abundance of arabinan and arabinogalactan (both type-I and type-II) side chains. The pectic fractions with lower macromolecular sizes were progressively enriched in more linear HG fragments. Finally, highly branched arabinans with DP of 50 were identified as free domains in the pectin fractions with lower molar mass. The obtained structural models will inform the development of target applications for the spruce bark pectins towards the realization of future integral second-generation biorefineries from lignocellulosic feedstocks.
