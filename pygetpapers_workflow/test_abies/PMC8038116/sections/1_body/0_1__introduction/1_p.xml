<p>The bark of Norway spruce (

 <xref rid="B2-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This abundant biomass is commonly used as a fuel to produce heat and electrical energy in the mill. Recently, there has been growing interest in converting industrial bark into added-value products as part of the biorefinery approach. This strategy requires a good understanding of the chemical composition of the bark and a deep knowledge of the macromolecular structure of its individual components. The bark contains considerable amounts of bioactive components such as antioxidants (polyphenols), and also structural polysaccharides such as pectins. Efficient pectin extraction and recovery would contribute to the integral valorization of this biomass resource through the design of cascade biorefinery processes resulting in a multiple product portfolio.
