<p>The pectin content in spruce bark has been estimated to be 9.0% in the outer bark, 12.6% in the inner bark, and 10.5% in the bark collected in a paper mill directly after the debarking process. [

 <xref rid="B5-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Pectins have also been identified in the bark of various conifer species such as black spruce [

 <xref rid="B9-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Nevertheless, most of these studies have been limited to a simple report of the carbohydrate composition of the bark and no real attempt dealing with the structural characterization of bark pectin at the different macromolecular hierarchical levels has been undertaken.
