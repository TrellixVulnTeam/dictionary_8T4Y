<p>Pressurized hot water extraction, i.e., extraction using water in liquid state at high temperature and pressure, emerges as a sustainable technology for the recovery of polysaccharides from recalcitrant lignocellulosic tissues [

 <xref rid="B27-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It allows for a mild extraction without extensive depolymerization of the biopolymers, so it can be further utilized in films or hydrogels. There is also potential to scale up this kind of extraction for industrial use [

 <xref rid="B4-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This structural characteristic has been confirmed by glycome profiling of cell wall extracts isolated from spruce bark and bark hot water extracts [
 <xref rid="B29-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, these studies were based on crude extracts or mixture of non-cellulosic polysaccharides and did not allow a precise structural characterization of bark pectins. The aim of this work was to elucidate the complex structure of pectins in the bark of 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic>, providing detailed information of the linkage patterns and the macromolecular architecture. The integration of this information offers a macromolecular model for the pectins from spruce bark.
