<p>The size fractionation of the treated pectin extract was performed on a Dionex Ultimate-3000 liquid chromatography system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), equipped with a 2 mL injection loop, an LPG-4300SD gradient pump and a Waters-410 refractive index (RI) detector (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Size separation was achieved using a preparative size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) column PSS SUPREMA (300 × 20 mm, porosity 1000 Å, particle size 10 µm) preceded with a guard column PSS SUPREMA (50 × 20 mm
 <sup>2</sup>, particle size 10 µm). An aqueous pectin solution at a concentration of 13.4 g L
 <sup>−1</sup> was injected and eluted with 10 mM NaOH as mobile phase with a flow rate of 1 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup> at 30 °C. A total of six fractions were collected manually after passing through the detector. The mild alkaline and temperature conditions enabled successful dissolution of the pectin without inducing any depolymerization or cleavage of glycosidic linkages, although the effect on the methylation and esterification cannot be excluded. This was out of the scope of this study.
