<p>A combination of methanolysis and TFA hydrolysis according to De Ruiter et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] was used to determine the neutral sugar and uronic acid composition of the samples. Briefly, 2–5 mg of dried sample was heated for 16 h at 80 °C with 1 mL of 2 M HCl in methanol in duplicate experiments. The methanolic HCl was evaporated using air at 25 °C and the remaining carbohydrates were further hydrolyzed with 1 mL of 2 M TFA for 1 h at 121 °C. TFA was removed by evaporation and the samples were dissolved in water in order to be analyzed with HPAEC-PAD. The HPAEC-PAD Dionex ICS-3000 was equipped with a precolumn CarboPac
 <sup>®</sup> PA1 4 × 50 mm and a CarboPac
 <sup>®</sup> PA1 4 × 250 mm
 <sup>2</sup> column. Separation of the neutral and acidic monosaccharides was performed in separate gradients as previously reported [
