<p>Absolute molar mass determinations were performed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC, SECcurity 1260, PSS, Mainz, Germany) coupled to a multiple angle laser light scattering detector (MALLS, BIC-MwA7000, Brookhaven Instrument Corp., New York, NY, USA) and a refractive index detector (SECcurity 1260, PSS, Mainz, Germany) thermostated at 40 °C. Prior to analyses, 1 mg of the parent pectin sample and the fractions were dissolved in 200 μL of 10 mM NaOH (MilliQ) overnight at room temperature under agitation. Sample injections of 100 μL were performed into a combined column set-up with a SUPREMA pre-column, a SUPREMA 1000 Å, and two SUPREMA 3000 Å analytical columns (PSS, Mainz, Germany) eluting with 1 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup> of 10 mM NaOH (MilliQ) as mobile phase at 40 °C.
