<p>Polysaccharides (5 mg) were first carboxyl reduced with sodium borodeuteride (NaBD
 <sub>4</sub>) using the method of Kim and Carpita [
 <xref rid="B39-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Carboxyl-reduced polysaccharides in the different fractions (1 mg, four technical replicates) were methylated using the NaOH/CH
 <sub>3</sub>I method [
 <xref rid="B40-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The methylation step was repeated five times on each sample, thereby avoiding any risk for incomplete methylation. After methylation, the samples were hydrolyzed with 2M TFA at 121 °C for 2 h, reduced, and acetylated [

The permethylated alditol acetates were separated and analyzed by GC/EI-MS on a SP-2380 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm ID; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) with a temperature program increasing from 160 °C to 210 °C at a rate of 1 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The mass spectra of the fragments obtained from the permethylated alditol acetates (EI-MS) were compared with those of reference polysaccharides derivatives and to available data [
