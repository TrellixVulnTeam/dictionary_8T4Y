<p>The ground inner bark was sequentially extracted in an Accelerated Solvent Extractor (ASE) (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) as described by Le Normand et al. [
 <xref rid="B3-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. 10 g wet inner bark (dry content of 56%) was placed in 34 mL stainless steel extraction cells, extracted with acetone at 100 °C followed by pressurized hot water extraction in 3 cycles of 20 min at 100 °C followed by 3 cycles of 20 min at 140 °C at a pressure of 100 bar. The fraction obtained after extraction at 140 °C was filtered, dialyzed against distilled water in a Spectra/Por dialysis tube with a molecular mass cut off of 3.5 kDa. Starch was removed from the filtered and dialyzed extracts by treatments with α-amylase from porcine pancreas (Type VI-B, 23 units/mg, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). For this, 50 mg of the freeze-dried extract were dissolved in 30 mL of 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7), stirred in a water bath at 37 °C, and the enzyme (7 mg) was added every 24 h during three days. The solution was then filtered, dialyzed and freeze-dried (Christ ALPHA 2–4 LD plus, Martin Christ GmbH, Niedersachsen, Germany).
