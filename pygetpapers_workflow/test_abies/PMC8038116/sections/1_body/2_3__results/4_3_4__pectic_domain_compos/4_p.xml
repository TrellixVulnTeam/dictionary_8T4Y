<p>Here, we propose and illustrate a macromolecular model for the molecular structure for bark pectins, based on the integration of the information on the macromolecular architecture and molecular weight distributions from SEC-MALLS, together with the analysis of the composition and glycosidic linkages of the different pectic domains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-01106-f004">Figure 4</xref>c). Fraction P3 is mainly composed by heavily branched macromolecules with short HG and RG-I domains, which are distributed block wise along the pectin chains. This representation is based on preliminary data of the degradation pattern of HG with 
 <italic>endo</italic>-polygalacturonase (data not shown). The formation of two narrow peaks at around 5500 kDa and 2500 kDa after incubation with endo-polygalacturonase suggested that the RG domains in the pectin chain had a size of around 15 to 30 sugar units. This proves that the structure of RG-I in P3 is heavily branched by arabinan and arabinogalactan side chains in most of the rhamnose backbone units, as it was reported by methylation linkage analysis. The fraction P4 seems to be formed by less branched macromolecules, where longer unbranched HG domains separate the RG-I regions in the block copolymer. Finally, fraction P5 seems to be composed by individual domains of HG and arabinans that may be linked to the RG-I domains with less probability than in P3 and P4. The origin of the polysaccharides in P5, whether they are present in the native bark or arise as degradation products from the extraction process, remains to be determined. The structural parameters of the pectic polysaccharides, this is, molar mass and branched structure, affect their functional performance in terms of viscosity and other rheological properties. Indeed, higher molar mass directly correlates with an increase of viscosity of pectin solutions and gels [

On the other hand, the specific distribution of pectic components (e.g., HG, RG-I, arabinan, and AG) has a deep influence on the rheological properties, also depending on the environment (e.g., pH, ionic strength, presence of low molecular weight cosolutes) [

 <xref rid="B67-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Thus, the higher 
 <italic>M
  <sub>w</sub>
 </italic> of P3 would suggest higher viscosity compared to P4 and P5. However, the 
 <italic>M
  <sub>w</sub>
 </italic> of P3 is still lower than that of other pectins such as citrus pectin. Hence, lower gelation ability could be assumed. Also, the high number of RG-I regions and higher branching in P3 will affect the rheological behavior and result in different properties of P3 compared to P4 and P5. In the past the impact of the HG regions on the rheological properties has mainly been studied. However, there has been increased interest in the use of RG-I-rich pectins, because of their health benefits, and it was shown that RG-I-rich pectins can also form gels with high gel strength [
