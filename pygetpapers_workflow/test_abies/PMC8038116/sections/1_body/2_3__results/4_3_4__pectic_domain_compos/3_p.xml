<p>The significant change in DP observed between P3 and P4 clearly designated two different pectin populations. On one hand, P3 was composed of high-molar mass branched polysaccharides with a high proportion of branched RG-I domains, whereas P4 had larger abundance of linear polysaccharides with long HG domains. Both fractions occupied, however, relatively similar hydrodynamic volumes since the elution times in SEC were close. Fraction P5 appeared to mainly be composed of arabinan domains, with comparable sizes as in P4, and smaller HG domains. However, the content in RG in this fraction was low, which indicated that some arabinans could be present as individual polysaccharide populations. It has been suggested that pure arabinans could be present in the stem of
