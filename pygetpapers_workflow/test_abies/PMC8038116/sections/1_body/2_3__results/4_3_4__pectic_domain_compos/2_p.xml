<p>All fractions were composed of approximately 85–90% pectins, where the additional 10–15% were assigned to mannans and xylans (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-01106-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). The most significant difference between P3 and the other two fractions (P4–P5) was their differing RG-I and HG content. In fact, the RG-I domain (including side chains) seemed to represent almost 80% of P3, while P4 and P5 contained only 50% of RG-I. On the contrary, HG was present in P4 and P5 in much higher proportions (~30%) than in P3 (~10%). However, the comparison of the average DP of each domain, illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-01106-f004">Figure 4</xref>b, suggested that the size of the HG domain was similar in P3 and P4. The proportion of HG and RG-I domains strongly depends on the source of the pectin. Commercial citrus and apple pectins, for example, contain mainly HG domains (ca. 65%) and minor amount of RG-I domains (ca. 20–35%) [
