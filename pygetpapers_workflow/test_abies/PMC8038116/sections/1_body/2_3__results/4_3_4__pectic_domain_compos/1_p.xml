<p>The nature of the pectin domains in spruce bark (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-01106-f004">Figure 4</xref>a) was deduced from the glycosidic linkage assignments that are characteristic for the different cell wall polysaccharides [
 <xref rid="B53-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], as provided in 
 <xref rid="polymers-13-01106-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The results from the polysaccharide assignment based on the glycosidic linkages were then processed together with the DP obtained with SEC-MALLS in order to estimate the DP of each pectic domain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-01106-f004">Figure 4</xref>b). This last estimation was based on the hypotheses that all domains were covalently linked to each other and that the pectin distributions in the fractions were monodisperse.
