<p>The glycosidic linkage composition of the parent P0 and the main SEC fractions (P3–P5) was investigated by methylation and GC-MS analysis (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-01106-f003">Figure 3</xref>), in order to study the structural characteristics of the polysaccharides present in spruce bark pectins. Approximately 24–30% of the arabinosyl residues in all fractions occurred as 5-Ara
 <italic>f</italic> linked units, 31–38% corresponded to terminal arabinosyl residues (t-Ara
 <italic>f</italic>), and the rest of the arabinose monosaccharides was represented by 3-, 3,5-, 2,5-, and 2,3,5-linked arabinofuranosyl units. These proportions confirmed the occurrence of highly branched arabinans with probably similar structures in P3, P4, and P5. Similar highly branched arabinans were also reported for the pectic polysaccharides from

 <xref rid="B51-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. A part of the arabinose units, especially the terminal residues, might also arise from the side chains in arabinogalactan associated with galactose units. Two types of arabinogalactans are generally present in pectic polysaccharides, namely arabinogalactans I (AG-I) and II (AG-II). The occurrence of AG-I was confirmed by the presence of 4-linked galactan backbones substituted at position 3. AG-II was also present in the fractions, since 3-, 3,6- and 6-linked galactopyranosyl (Gal
 <italic>p</italic>) residues were detected.
