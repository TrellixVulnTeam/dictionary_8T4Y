<p>In all fractions, GalA was mostly composed of 1,4-linked residues (90–93 mol% of total galacturonic acid), which could originate from either RG or HG domains. A similar proportion of 1,4-linked galacturonic acid (ca. 93% of all uronic acid) was reported for acid-extractable polysaccharides from tree greenery of Norway spruce [
 <xref rid="B52-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Approximately 6% of the galacturosyl residues were substituted in position 3 in P3 and P4. This substitution was previously detected in the pressurized hot water extracts of spruce bark [
 <xref rid="B4-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In pectins, galacturonic acid is usually substituted at position 3 with xylosyl residues, forming xylogalacturonan (XGA) chains, or by other sugars such as apiofuranose in the RG-II domain [
 <xref rid="B10-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The presence of RG-I domains was revealed by the signature linkages arising from 2- and 2,4-linked Rha
 <italic>p</italic> units. These domains were particularly enriched in fractions P3 and P4, as evidenced by the relatively high number of such 2- and 2,4-linked Rha
 <italic>p</italic> units (~95–98 %mol of the total Rha
 <italic>p</italic> units). On the contrary, 2-Rha
 <italic>p</italic> units were absent in the low molar mass fraction P5. Finally, the presence of minor mannan and xylan hemicellulosic populations was revealed by the signature 4-Man
 <italic>p</italic> and 4-Xyl
 <italic>p</italic> linkages, respectively. Interestingly, the xylan populations were particularly enriched in the fraction P5.
