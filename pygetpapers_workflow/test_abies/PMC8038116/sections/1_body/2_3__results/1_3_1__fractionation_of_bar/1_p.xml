<p>The amylase-treated bark extract (sample P0) was fractionated using preparative size exclusion chromatography (SEC) into six fractions (P1â€“P6) with decreasing macromolecular sizes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-01106-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). The yields of the different fractions (
 <xref rid="polymers-13-01106-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) indicate the larger content in the intermediate fractions (P3-P5) as reflected in the preparative SEC distribution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-01106-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). The size distributions for each fraction, namely the SEC weight distribution
