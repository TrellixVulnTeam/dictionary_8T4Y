 <xref rid="polymers-13-01106-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The average molar masses of the original pectin fraction P0 were close to the values previously reported (

  <sub>n</sub>

 <italic>M

 </italic> = 54,900 Da) for the crude pressurized hot water extract of the inner bark [
 <xref rid="B4-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The molar mass (
 <italic>M
  <sub>w</sub>
 </italic>) and dispersity (
 <italic>D</italic>) were, however, slightly lower in the present work. This difference might be explained by the amylase treatment performed here, which led to the removal of large starch polymers. The average molar mass of the extracted bark pectins remained low compared to pectins from fruit tissues, which display 
 <italic>M
  <sub>w</sub>
 </italic> values in the range of 100,000 to 200,000 Da [
 <xref rid="B43-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] or sugar beet pectins (
 <italic>M
  <sub>w</sub>
 </italic> of 500,000 Da) [
 <xref rid="B46-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, similar 
 <italic>M
  <sub>w</sub>
 </italic> were reported for pectins extracted with hot water from different plant sources [
 <xref rid="B47-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The parent pectin P0 showed a broad dispersity (
 <italic>D</italic> = 2.2) in comparison to the derived fractions, which displayed a much narrower profile with a dispersity close to unity. Such low dispersity indicated a good fractionation and revealed the obtention of almost monodisperse pectin fractions. The estimated degree of polymerization (DP) of the polysaccharides varied significantly between the fractions, with fraction P3 containing polysaccharide networks four to seven times larger than P4 or P5, respectively.
