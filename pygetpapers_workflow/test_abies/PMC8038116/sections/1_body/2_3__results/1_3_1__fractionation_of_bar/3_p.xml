<p>Similarly, the absolute weight-average molar mass distributions (

 <italic>
  <sub>w</sub>
 </italic>) of the different fractions shifted progressively towards lower values, almost superimposing with the parent pectin sample P0. It is worth mentioning that the 
 <italic>M
  <sub>w</sub>
 </italic> values of the fractions P1 and P6 could not be obtained due to the small concentration in such fractions. Interestingly, the slope of the size dependence of the molar masses decreased for the smaller fractions. This slope is related to the hydrodynamic compactness of the macromolecules in solution, related to the degree of branching. These results might indicate that the larger macromolecules in fractions P2–P3 had a more compact and dense architecture—typical of branched polymers—compared to the smaller macromolecules in fractions P4 and P5. The intramolecular structure for selected fractions will be verified by linkage analysis and subsequently related to the macromolecular architecture and hydrodynamic properties from SEC-MALLS.
