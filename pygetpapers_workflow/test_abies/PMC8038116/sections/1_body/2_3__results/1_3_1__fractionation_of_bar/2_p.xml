 <italic>
  <sub>h</sub>
 </italic>) and the weight-average molar mass 
 <italic>M
  <sub>w</sub>

  <sub>h</sub>
 </italic>) plotted as a function of the hydrodynamic radius (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <italic>
  <sub>h</sub>
 </italic>) for the parent pectin sample (P0) and the resulting fractions. As it can be observed, the parent P0 pectin sample displays a broad distribution with hydrodynamic sizes ranging between 1 and 40 nm. The size fractions (P1â€“P6) all fell under the envelope of the parent fraction P0 with progressively decreasing hydrodynamic sizes, which evidences the successful preparative fractionation. The SEC weight distributions 
 <italic>w</italic>(log 
 <italic>V
  <sub>h</sub>
 </italic>) of the parent pectin P0 and the derived fractions displayed one major peak with symmetrical shape. The shoulders at low 
 <italic>R
  <sub>h</sub>
 </italic> (
 <italic>R
  <sub>h</sub>
 </italic> ~ 1 and 2 nm) occurring in all distribution profiles were also present in the eluent blank and were therefore assigned to a system peak and did not affect the molar mass calculations.
