<p>The carbohydrate composition of the parent pectin and the derived fractions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-01106-f002">Figure 2</xref>a) contained the typical pectic components, including Ara, GalA, Rha, and Gal, albeit with different relative proportions across fractions. Minor presence of other carbohydrates, such as xylose, mannose, and glucose were also detected, which could either be included in the pectin molecules as side chain or be present as individual polysaccharides in minor quantities [

 <xref rid="B50-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Interestingly, the first fraction P1 displayed a large abundance of Glc, which could be attributed to residual starch that might have remained after the destarching process. The monosaccharide composition of the remaining pectic fractions (P2–P6) displayed interesting trends related to the relative amounts of GalA and Ara. The fractions with larger macromolecular sizes (P2–P3) showed a high proportion of Ara compared to GalA, accompanied by a higher relative content of Rha and Gal. This suggests the presence of pectic domains rich in arabinans and arabinogalactans linked to Rha residues in rhamnogalacturonan type I (RG-I). The presence of highly branched RG-I domains in the bark of Norway spruce was already proposed [

 <xref rid="B29-polymers-13-01106" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The intermediate fraction (P4) was enriched in GalA (45%), probably originating from linear homogalacturonan domains (HG), with a lower proportion of Ara and Gal moieties. The fraction P5 contained arabinose and galacturonic acid in rather equal amounts (35–40%), with a smaller proportion of Rha. As Rha is considered the branching point that covalently binds arabinans and arabinogalactan side chains with the RG-I backbone, we suggest that P5 is composed of a mixture of individual polysaccharide populations. The fraction P6 had a large proportion of Ara with negligible abundance of GalA, which probably corresponds with free arabinan populations with small hydrodynamic sizes and highly branched topologies. The relative abundance of the monosaccharide content in the different fractions related to the parent P0 pectin fraction is calculated by multiplying the relative amount of the monosaccharide (weight%) found in the fractions with the yield (%) in which the fractions were obtained (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-01106-f002">Figure 2</xref>b). This provides a good overview of the relative abundance of the different pectic domains (e.g., RG-I, HG, arabinan, arabinogalactan) present in the original pectin sample and the derived fractions.
