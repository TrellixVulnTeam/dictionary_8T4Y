 <italic>PKL</italic> acts as a repressor not only for the expression of embryonic traits but also represses the seedling de-etiolation pathway; 
 <italic>PKL</italic> acts additively with SUPPRESSOR OF PHYTOCHROME A1 (SPA1) to repress seedling de-etiolation and inhibits the protein and transcript levels of ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) which is one of the important transcription factors that positively regulates the process of photomorphogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. 
 <italic>PKL</italic> physically interacts with HY5 and also with HY5-HOMOLOG (HYH), the close homolog of HY5 to regulate the hypocotyl cell elongation in 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and interestingly, the ATPase domain of 
 <italic>PKL</italic> is essential and sufficient for the interaction with both HY5 and HYH [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. However, a point mutation (Lysine to Alanine) at the position Lys-304 in 
 <italic>PKL</italic> terminates this interaction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. Lys-304 in 
 <italic>A. thaliana PKL</italic>, is an evolutionarily conserved amino acid that is predicted to bind to ATP within the ATPase domain of 
 <italic>PKL</italic>. This amino acid was found to be conserved in all the 
 <italic>PKL</italic> sequences of the conifer species where the ATPase domain was detected, which includes 
 <italic>P. abies, P. taeda, P. sylvestris, P. pinaster</italic> and 
 <italic>P. menziesii</italic> (Figure S19, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>.pdf). Only two 
 <italic>PKL</italic> sequences, one from 
 <italic>P. menziesii</italic> and one from 
 <italic>P. taeda</italic> were found to possess all the known domains of 
 <italic>PKL</italic>. The detection of partial 
 <italic>PKL</italic> sequences in the other conifers maybe because of either lack of data availability due to sequencing quality and/or poor annotation. Yet, it could also be argued that 
 <italic>PKL</italic> in conifers with only some specific domains acts in a different fashion from what is known in the more advanced angiosperm species, as conifers are known to possess certain specialized pathways compared to the angiosperms e.g. specialization of photosynthetic apparatus in 
 <italic>P. menziesii</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]; however, further detailed molecular studies are required to confirm this.
