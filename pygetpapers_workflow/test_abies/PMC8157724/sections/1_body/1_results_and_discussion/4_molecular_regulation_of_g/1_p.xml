<p id="Par42">A schematic model for the mechanism of regulation of initiation of somatic embryogenesis in plants with reference to the key genes involved in the process is summarised in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Homologues for all the candidate initiation genes except for 
 <italic>LEC2</italic> were detected in the conifers. The knowledge in conifers with reference to the initiation of SE is limited to the information regarding the expression patterns of the genes involved and there is lack of evidence for regulation of the process through a gene network. We propose a putative alternative mechanism of the molecular regulation of the process of SE initiation, which may be functional in conifers in absence of 
 <italic>LEC2</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) assuming that the overall functions of the other genes involved are conserved in conifers. 
 <italic>LEC2</italic> is one of the central players in the process of seed and embryo development in plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, although 
 <italic>LEC2</italic> regulates SE through stimulation of auxin synthesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>], one of the major roles of 
 <italic>LEC2</italic> is to upregulate 
 <italic>FUS3</italic> and 
 <italic>ABI3;</italic> however, 
 <italic>ABI3</italic> and 
 <italic>FUS3</italic> positively regulate themselves and each other to achieve a uniform expression in the embryo through the feedback loops [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. 
 <italic>LEC1</italic> has also been shown to positively regulate 
 <italic>ABI3</italic> and 
 <italic>FUS3</italic> expression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. Although the expression levels of 
 <italic>ABI3</italic> and 
 <italic>FUS3</italic> were lowered in 
 <italic>LEC2</italic> mutants, constitutive expression of 
 <italic>ABI3</italic> or 
 <italic>FUS3</italic> was able to rescue the 
 <italic>LEC2</italic> phenotypes in 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. Further, 
 <italic>ABI3</italic>, 
 <italic>LEC2</italic>, and 
 <italic>FUS3</italic> were proposed to work in parallel pathways and also, 
 <italic>FUS3</italic> and 
 <italic>LEC2</italic> were shown to act in a partially redundant manner [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. From this context, the action of ABI3/FUS3 or both may compensate the absence of 
 <italic>LEC2</italic> in conifers. Similar to 
 <italic>LEC2, LEC1</italic> mediates not only the up-regulation of the auxin synthesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>] but also facilitates effects of auxin to promote embryonic cell identity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. Although BBM and LEC2 regulate each other through a feedback loop, LEC1 and BBM also regulate each other in a similar way [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Moreover, BBM also stimulates its own expression through a positive feedback loop to control its own activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. With these assumptions, we propose that in conifers, 
 <italic>LEC1</italic> (possibility along with 
 <italic>LEC1-LIKE</italic>) regulates the network in order to make up for the loss of 
 <italic>LEC2.</italic> To summarise, SE regulation in conifers may include action of ABI3/FUS3 or both to compensate the absence of 
 <italic>LEC2</italic>, and the conifer 
 <italic>LEC1</italic> along with 
 <italic>LEC1-LIKE</italic> might be capable of performing adequate functions that are carried out by 
 <italic>LEC2</italic>. However, further molecular work is required to confirm such associated alternative pathways in the conifer species. In this context, it is worth mentioning again that conifers are known to follow alternative pathways e.g. networks associated with photosynthesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] and proposed molecular mechanisms involved with etiolation/de-etiolation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>].
