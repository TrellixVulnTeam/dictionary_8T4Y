 <italic>WUS</italic> homologue was reported by previous investigations related to the analysis of the 
 <italic>WOX</italic> gene family in 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and also in 
 <italic>P. pinaster</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although 
 <italic>WUS</italic> and 
 <italic>WOX</italic>5 have similar domains (Homeodomain [HD], 
 <italic>WUS</italic>-box [TL-X-L-F-P] and EAR domain [L-X-L-X-L]), 
 <italic>WUS</italic> has an extra Y residue in the homeobox domain which is conserved in several plant species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. This conserved extra Y residue was earlier reported to be found in the HD of 
 <italic>WUS</italic> in conifer species e.g. 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and also in 
 <italic>P. pinaster</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] (Figure S6, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>.pdf). Only one new 
 <italic>WUS</italic> homologue was detected in the current analysis in Gymno PLAZA in 
 <italic>P. taeda</italic>, which also possessed the extra Y residue (PTA00030527). This particular sequence is annotated as 
 <italic>WOX</italic>4 in the Gymno PLAZA, but since it has the highly conserved extra Y residue in HD, we propose that this is actually the 
 <italic>WUS</italic> gene. 
 <italic>WOX</italic>2 contains the HD and 
 <italic>WUS</italic>-box [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], which was found to be conserved in the conifer species included in this work similar to the earlier studies in conifers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] (Figure S17, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>.pdf).
