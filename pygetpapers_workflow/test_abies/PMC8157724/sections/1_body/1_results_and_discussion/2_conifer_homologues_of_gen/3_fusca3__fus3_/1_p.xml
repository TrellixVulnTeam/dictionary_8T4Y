<p id="Par33">The intact B3 domain is essential for the regulation of seed maturation by 
 <italic>FUS3</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Similar to the angiosperms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>], the B domain of 
 <italic>FUS3</italic> was more conserved among the conifer species as compared to the N-terminal domain and transcription-activating domain (Figure S16, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>.pdf). The transcription-activating domain contains conserved 
 <italic>FUS3</italic>-specific fragments in dicots and in monocots respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Likewise, the transcription-activating domain of the 
 <italic>FUS3</italic> sequences was found to contain conifer-specific fragments as the transcription-activating domain shows good alignment within the conifer species included in the study but not with 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic>.
