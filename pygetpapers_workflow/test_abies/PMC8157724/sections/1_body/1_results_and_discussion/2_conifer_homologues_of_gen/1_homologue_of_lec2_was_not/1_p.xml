<p id="Par30">In the current work, 
 <italic>LEC2</italic>, which is a TF that plays a key role in the initiation and regulation of SE, was found to be absent from the genomes of the 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> and 
 <italic>P. taeda</italic>. 
 <italic>LEC2</italic> was not detected in the other conifer species included in the study, based on available sequence data in those conifers to date. This observation is strongly supported by the fact that the searches were performed on full genomes of two conifer species involved in this analysis, one each from the genus 
 <italic>Picea</italic> (
 <italic>P. abies</italic>) and 
 <italic>Pinus</italic> (
 <italic>P. taeda</italic>). The phylogenetic tree constructed with conifer homologues of the B3 domain containing TFs (FUS3 and VP1/ABI3, as LEC2 is absent in conifers) and the 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> LEC2, indicates that conifer FUS3 and VP1/ABI3 form separate clusters and the 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> LEC2 forms a distinct clade (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In addition, all the 
 <italic>LEC</italic>-like conifer homologues showed better alignment with 
 <italic>A. thaliana LEC1</italic>/
 <italic>LEC1</italic>-
 <italic>LIKE</italic> than 
 <italic>A. thaliana LEC2</italic> (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>.pdf). This suggests that 
 <italic>LEC2</italic> may be absent in conifers, at least in the two conifer species whose whole-genome sequence data is available (
 <italic>P. abies</italic> and 
 <italic>P. taeda</italic>). Furthermore, several transcriptomic investigations related to SE development in conifer species have been conducted but none of them reported the expression of 
 <italic>LEC2</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], whereas 
 <italic>LEC2</italic> expression is commonly reported in transcriptome analyses in model systems e.g. 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Likewise, an earlier study reported that 
 <italic>ABI3</italic> homologues were found in all land plant genomes, but the 
 <italic>FUS3</italic> homologues were present only in seed plants, while the 
 <italic>LEC2</italic>-like sequences were detected only in dicot genomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Phylogenetic and gene structure analyses of AFL genes (
 <italic>ABI3/VP1</italic>, 
 <italic>FUS3</italic> and 
 <italic>LEC2</italic>) in land plant species revealed loss of 
 <italic>LEC2</italic> type genes in monocots [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This further supports our hypothesis that 
 <italic>LEC2</italic> may be broadly absent in conifers.
