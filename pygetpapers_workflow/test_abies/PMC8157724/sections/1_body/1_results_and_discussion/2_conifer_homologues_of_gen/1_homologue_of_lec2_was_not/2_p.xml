<p id="Par31">From the context of loss of genes during evolution, eukaryotic plastid genome has lost many genes during the early events of endosymbiosis; some of these genes were lost totally, while others were found to be relocated and got functionally integrated to the host nuclear genomes during plant evolution [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. In conifers, loss of 
 <italic>ndh</italic> genes from several species is evident from plastid genome sequencing projects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] but later, the presence of non-functional plastid 
 <italic>ndh</italic> gene fragments was confirmed in the nuclear genome of 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Likewise, there is a specialization of the photosynthetic apparatus in Pinaceae; comparative analysis of the gene families reported gains and losses of genetic networks associated with photosynthesis in 
 <italic>Pseudotsuga menziesii</italic> (
 <italic>P. menziesii</italic>, Douglas-fir) from family Pinaceae [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. The current analysis suggests loss of 
 <italic>LEC2</italic> gene from 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> and 
 <italic>P. taeda</italic>, and also from other conifer species included in the study, based on the available sequence information. Embryo development in gymnosperms including conifers is very different from angiosperms in several aspects. For example, the endosperm of gymnosperm is haploid as there is no double fertilization. The conifers possess multiple cotyledons which is a distinctive phenotypic character compared to the monocots and dicots. Few such mechanisms/phenomenon in gymnosperms which are different from the angiosperms, could explain the lack of a master embryogenesis regulator such as 
 <italic>LEC2</italic> gene from the conifers.
