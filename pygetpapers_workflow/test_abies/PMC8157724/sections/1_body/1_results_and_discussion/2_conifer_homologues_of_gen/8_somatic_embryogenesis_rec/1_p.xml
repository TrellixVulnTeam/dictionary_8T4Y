<p id="Par39">Most of the conifer sequences retrieved with the BLASTP searches with 
 <italic>A. thaliana SERK1</italic> were categorised as 
 <italic>SERK1</italic> by the respective databases, however a few sequences were referred to as 
 <italic>SERK1-like</italic> or 
 <italic>SERK2</italic> (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>.pdf). We have included all these sequences in our analysis because 
 <italic>SERK1</italic> and 
 <italic>SERK2</italic> share 90% identity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>] and these two genes function redundantly while playing a major role in somatic and reproductive cell differentiation as reported during early anther development in 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. The different domains of 
 <italic>SERK1-like</italic> or 
 <italic>SERK2</italic> were found to be well conserved in all the conifer homologues (Figure S31, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>.pdf). The 
 <italic>SERK1-like</italic> or 
 <italic>SERK2</italic> conifer homologues contained signal peptide domain, Leucine zipper domain with four conserved Leucine residues, five Leucine rich repeats, the Serine–Proline–Proline (SPP) domain with conserved SPP motifs, the transmembrane domain, the 11 subdomains of the protein kinase domain and the C-teminal domain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Two pairs of cysteine residues were present in the Leucine zipper and SPP domain of the conifer homologues respectively, which were reported to be conserved [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. The Arginine and Aspartate residues of the subdomain VI of the protein kinase domain, were found to be conserved in all the conifer homologues that contained this domain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>].
