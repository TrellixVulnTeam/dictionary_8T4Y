<p id="Par36">The 
 <italic>BBM</italic>-1 motif and a 
 <italic>BBM</italic>-1 like motif were detected in the current analysis in conifer proteins – the GLSMIKTW (
 <italic>BBM</italic>-1 motif) was found in 
 <italic>P. abies, P. taeda</italic> and 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic>, and the ELSDFKTW (
 <italic>BBM</italic>-1 like) motif was found in 
 <italic>Thuja koraiensis</italic> (
 <italic>T. koraiensis</italic>) (Figure S21, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>.pdf)
 <italic>.</italic> The phylogenetic tree constructed with the sequences of conifer homologues of BBM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) shows that the sequences from 
 <italic>P. menziesii</italic> (PME00019482), 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> (PAB00065438), 
 <italic>P. pinaster</italic> (PPI00013750) and 
 <italic>P. thunbergii</italic> (BAD16602.1) are closer to 
 <italic>A. thaliana ANT</italic>. BAD16602.1 and PAB00065438 (MA_98095g0010) are characterised as 
 <italic>AINTEGUMENTA-</italic>like in the respective databases from where the sequences were obtained. Likewise, PPI00013750 is predicted as AP2-like ethylene-responsive transcription factor ANT in Gymno PLAZA, whereas there is no annotation information available for PME00019482. The 
 <italic>BBM</italic>-1 motif was not detected in these four sequences; instead they show presence of the GLSALKTW motif. The GLSALKTW motif has higher similarity to the 
 <italic>BBM</italic>-1 motif (GLSMIKTW) than the motif found in the 
 <italic>ANT</italic> gene (SLSMSPGS). The requirement of the 
 <italic>BBM</italic>-1 motif for the proper functioning of the 
 <italic>BBM</italic> is demonstrated earlier [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. We propose that the gene homologues found in the conifers, which show homology with the 
 <italic>ANT</italic> or are characterised as 
 <italic>ANT</italic>-like genes in either Congenie or Gymno PLAZA but contain the 
 <italic>BBM</italic>-1 like motif (GLSALKTW), may be the potential 
 <italic>BBM</italic>-like genes. However, further analysis is required to confirm the functional conservation of these proteins in conifers and angiosperms.
