<p id="Par37">The AP2 subfamily members that are involved in stress responses contain a single copy of the AP2 domain whereas two copies of the AP2 domains are present in the members which play a role in plant development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]; 
 <italic>EMK</italic> contains two AP2 domains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In the current study, five conifer sequences were detected with the BLAST searches; three (
 <italic>P. abies, P. sylvestris, P. pinaster</italic>) showed two AP2 domains, which may be the precise putative homologues of the 
 <italic>EMK</italic> genes, while two sequences were found with only one AP2 domain (
 <italic>P. taeda</italic>, 
 <italic>P. menziesii</italic>). The two AP2 domains appear to be conserved among all the sequences in the alignment (Figure S6, Additional file
