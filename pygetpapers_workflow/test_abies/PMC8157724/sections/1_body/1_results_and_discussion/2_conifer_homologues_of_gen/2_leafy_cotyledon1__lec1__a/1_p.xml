<p id="Par32">BLASTP with 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> LEC1 and LEC1-LIKE, resulted in finding the conifer genes characterised as the LEC-like CCAAT-box binding factor HAP3 or the LEC1-type HAP3 subunit coding protein. Congenie displayed 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> LEC1-LIKE as the best match for the conifer homologues detected. The phylogenetic tree constructed with conifer homologues of the LEC sequences precisely indicates that all the LEC/LEC-LIKE conifer homologues either cluster together with 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> LEC1 or 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> LEC1-LIKE sequences (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Here 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> LEC2 is an outgroup which forms a separate clade. All the LEC-like conifer homologues showed alignment with 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> LEC1 and LEC1-LIKE sequences (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>.pdf). The Asp (D) residue is critical for the LEC function [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] was found to be conserved in conifers. In addition, the residues unique to 
 <italic>LEC1</italic> and 
 <italic>LEC1</italic>-
 <italic>LIKE</italic> HAP3 subunits in the B-domain were found to be conserved in conifers (Figure S57, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>.pdf); these residues were absent from the B-domain of other HAP3 proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>].
