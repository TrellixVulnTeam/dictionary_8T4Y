<p id="Par34">The 
 <italic>VP1</italic> protein contains four domains – A1, B1, B2 and the B3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]; the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> gene with all the four domains were detected for all the conifer species included in this study. Three homologues of 
 <italic>VP1</italic> were detected in 
 <italic>P. taeda</italic> that contained all four domains, while in case of 
 <italic>P. pinaster</italic>, only one sequence (PPI00070933) out of the two with all four domains seems to be the precise homologue of 
 <italic>VP1</italic> as the other sequence (PPI00070934) did not show good alignment with the 
 <italic>A. thaliana VP1</italic> (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>.pdf). Four homologues of 
 <italic>VP1</italic> were detected in 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> but only one sequence (AAG22585.1) showed all four domains (Figure S19, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>.pdf). One sequence from 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> contained the A1 and the B1 domains (PAB00050494), while the other contained B2 and B3 domains (PAB00050493). We propose that these two sequences may be parts of the same gene but are indicated as separate genes possibly due to annotation and/or sequencing issues. The putative nuclear localization signal (RKNR) of the B2 domain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] was found to be conserved in all conifer species that showed presence of the B2 domain. The B3 DNA-binding domain of the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> genes is well conserved as reported earlier [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] among all conifer homologues and also shows high similarity with 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (Figure S19, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>.pdf).
