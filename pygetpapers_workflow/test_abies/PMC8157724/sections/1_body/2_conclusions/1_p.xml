<p id="Par43">This in silico analysis suggests absence of 
 <italic>LEC2</italic> in 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> and 
 <italic>P. taeda</italic>, the conifer species whose genomes have been sequenced. Based on available sequence data to date, 
 <italic>LEC2</italic> was also not detected in the other conifer species included in the study. The presence of a haploid endosperm due to the absence of a double fertilization event and presence of multiple cotyledons in conifers, could be associated with the lack of a master embryogenesis regulator such as 
 <italic>LEC2</italic> gene from the conifers. Based on existing expression data, SE regulation in conifers may include action of ABI3/FUS3 or both to compensate for the absence of 
 <italic>LEC2</italic>, and the conifer 
 <italic>LEC1</italic> along with 
 <italic>LEC1-LIKE</italic> might be capable of performing adequate functions that are otherwise carried out by 
 <italic>LEC2</italic>. However, further molecular analyses are required to confirm such associated alternative pathways in conifers. Furthermore, conifers exhibit characteristic mechanisms with reference to somatic embryo development such as the presence of cleavage polyembryony in 
 <italic>Pinus</italic> but broadly not in 
 <italic>Picea</italic>. Analyses of PEMs from more or less polyembryogenic species with respect to known transcription factors involved in somatic embryo regulation in model species could offer insights to regulatory processes active during conifer embryo development. The current work presents fundamental information to support applied studies into underlying molecular mechanisms of conifer somatic embryo initiation and development.
