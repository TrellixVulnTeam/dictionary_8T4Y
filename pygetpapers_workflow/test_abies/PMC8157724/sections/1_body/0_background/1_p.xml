<p id="Par17">Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is the process of non-sexual reproduction in which the embryos develop from somatic tissue in vitro on medium in most cases supplemented with growth regulators. Somatic embryos morphologically resemble the zygotic embryos; SE in conifers involves the formation of early-stage somatic embryos, so-called pro-embryogenic masses (PEM), followed by somatic embryo maturation, partial drying with desiccation and germination, giving rise to plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. SE has gained importance not only for its use as a model system in basic studies related to molecular genetics and developmental biology but largely due its application for the large-scale vegetative propagation of plants of uniform quality with selected characters, for commercial purposes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This is of particular interest to the important part of the forest industry based on conifers where the majority of species with large commercial potential are difficult to propagate by traditional cloning methods. In addition, conifers have slow growth, long generation time and very large genome size that makes their genetic improvement difficult and time consuming. SE allows genetic improvements from conifer breeding programs to be captured at an earlier stage and large numbers of high-value plants can be produced [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Clonal propagation by SE was successfully demonstrated in coniferous species in the 1980s in 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> (
 <italic>P. abies</italic> [L.] Karst, Norway spruce) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], then in other genera in the family Pinaceae namely 
 <italic>Abies</italic>, 
 <italic>Larix</italic>, 
 <italic>Picea</italic>, 
 <italic>Pinus</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudotsuga</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and only few species from other conifers belonging to the families Cupressaceae, Taxaceae, Cephalotaxaceae, and Araucariaceae [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, regardless of major technical advances in clonal propagation by SE in conifers, some biological bottlenecks remain. A key step of concern is the limited initiation of SE across genotypes where only a subsection of the seeds can be induced to form a culture of somatic embryos. Furthermore, there are losses in each step during the subsequent development from PEMs to plant lowering the yields. There is only limited information available on the regulation of the SE processes in conifers. Therefore, the identification of key proteins controlling SE with reference to their structural domains deserves primary attention from the conifer perspective. Most investigations in conifers have been focused on the domain characterisation of the WUSCHEL (WUS) and WUS-related homeobox (WOX) protein family [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Although expression profiles of some genes associated with SE initiation in conifers have been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], the genetic and molecular interactions in the regulatory network associated with SE development has not been investigated in these species. In addition, there is no information available in conifers regarding the genes involved in suppression of SE (e.g. 
 <italic>PICKLE</italic>). The motivation for the present study is therefore to summarize information on conifer homologues for the most relevant key regulatory genes involved in SE in model species with the aim to provide a foundation for further detailed studies into functional regulation of the SE process in conifers.
