<p id="Par18">The current work presents in silico identification of putative homologues in conifers to the key regulators of SE based on sequence similarity using BLASTP. These key regulators of SE have been previously identified in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic>)
 <italic>.</italic> The analysis includes the identification of putative functional domains of the respective genes, again based on sequence similarity. In addition, relevant information available in the literature with reference to genes associated with SE in conifers has also been reviewed. The analysis focuses mainly on the transcription factors that are demonstrated to be directly involved in the initiation of the SE in the model plants, primarily 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. A few other genes that are known to play significant role during the SE process were also included in the analysis, e.g. 
 <italic>SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE</italic> (
 <italic>SERK</italic>) which is associated with the initiation of SE and genes like 
 <italic>PICKLE</italic> (
 <italic>PKL)</italic> that are involved in the suppression of SE.
