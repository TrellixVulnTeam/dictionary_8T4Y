<p id="Par28">VP1/ABI3-LIKE (VAL) proteins belong to the plant specific B3 TF superfamily the members of which contains the conserved B3 DNA-binding domain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. VALs in 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> contain PHD-L (plant homeodomain-like), Zf (Zinc finger), B3, CW-Zf (named CW for its conserved cysteine and tryptophan residues) and EAR (ethylene response factor [ERF]- associated repression) domains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The B3 domain of VAL mediates the repression of genes of the LAFL network; B3 domain of 
 <italic>VAL1</italic> and 
 <italic>VAL2</italic> is more similar when compared to 
 <italic>VAL3</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] and all key residues involved in direct DNA contacts are conserved among 
 <italic>VAL1</italic> and 
 <italic>VAL2</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The PHD and CW-Zf domains are the histone modification readers which are involved in recognition, and the EAR motifs mediate the transcriptional repression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. In 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, 
 <italic>VAL1</italic> and 
 <italic>VAL2</italic> have been reported as suppressors of somatic embryogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]; nevertheless, the 
 <italic>VAL</italic> genes function as suppressors of the LAFL genes during germination, but not during seed development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Knock-down mutations in genes encoding the VAL proteins led to increased expression of 
 <italic>LEC</italic> genes that resulted in the formation of ectopic somatic embryos on seedlings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Similarly to 
 <italic>PKL</italic>, the functional mechanism of the action of VAL genes has not been investigated in conifers.
