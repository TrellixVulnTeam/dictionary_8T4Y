 <italic>PICKLE</italic> (
 <italic>PKL</italic>) codes for a chromatin re-modeling factor that belongs to the chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding (CHD) subfamily II. CHD complexes regulate the assembly and organization of mature nucleosomes along the DNA. CHD proteins are members of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes that are characterized by presence of the chromo (chromatin organization modifier) domains, SNF2-related helicase/ATPase domain and a DNA-binding domain [

 <italic>PKL</italic> is necessary to repress expression of embryonic traits during germination and it regulates the transition from embryonic to vegetative development in 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. In particular, 
 <italic>PKL</italic> is necessary for repression of 
 <italic>LEC1</italic>, a transcription factor, which is one of the key regulators that initiates embryo development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. However, there is a lack of information on the function of 
 <italic>PKL</italic> in conifers.
