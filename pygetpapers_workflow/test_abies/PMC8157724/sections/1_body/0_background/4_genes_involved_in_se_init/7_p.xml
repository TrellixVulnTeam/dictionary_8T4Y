 <italic>SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (SERK)</italic> belongs to the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like family of kinases (LRR-RLKs) that are involved in multiple processes in plant development. 
 <italic>SERK</italic> contributes significantly to the process plant embryogenesis and is also found to be involved in diverse plant processes related to cell differentiation, growth and development, and plays important role in plant defense and plant responses to environmental cues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Five 
 <italic>SERK</italic> genes (
 <italic>SERK1–5</italic>) are identified in 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, where 
 <italic>SERK1</italic> forms a component of the embryogenesis signalling pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Overexpression of 
 <italic>SERK1</italic> enhanced embryogenic competence in tissue cultures of 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Expression of 
 <italic>SERK1</italic>-
 <italic>like</italic> was associated with initiation and early SE in 
 <italic>P. glauca</italic>, as its expression was detected to be higher in the PEMs than in callus, however it was lower in the PEMs than in young shoot buds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A putative homolog of 
 <italic>SERK1</italic> gene was found to be expressed in 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic> specifically at the very early stage of embryo development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]
 <italic>.</italic> In 
 <italic>A. angustifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>SERK1</italic> transcripts initially accumulated in the groups of cells at the periphery of the PEMs and were then restricted to the developing embryo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. 
 <italic>SERK1–3</italic> and 
 <italic>SERK1–4</italic> in 
 <italic>C. lanceolata</italic> share a high similarity with 
 <italic>A. thaliana SERK1</italic>, and are predominantly expressed in PEMs indicating that both have functions during SE [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].
