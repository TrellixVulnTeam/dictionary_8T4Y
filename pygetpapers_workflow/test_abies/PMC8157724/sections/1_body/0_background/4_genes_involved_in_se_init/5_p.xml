 <italic>EMK</italic> or 
 <italic>AIL</italic>5 codes for members of the AP2/ethylene-responsive element binding protein (AP2/EREBP) superfamily having the AP2 DNA-binding domain. 
 <italic>EMK</italic> is involved in germination and seedling growth, and is essential for the developmental transition between the embryogenic and vegetative phases; over-expression of 
 <italic>EMK</italic> resulted in the formation of somatic embryos on cotyledons in 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Early embryo development is associated with cleavage polyembryony in 
 <italic>Pinus</italic> species but not in 
 <italic>Picea</italic>, a process where the proembyo undergoes a cleavage process giving rise to multiple embryos; only one of these embryos develops to a dominant embryo that matures to a cotyledonary embryo, while the other embryos (subordinate embryos) are degraded [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Genome-wide transcript expression profiling of early stages of zygotic embryo development in 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic> showed transcript abundance of 
 <italic>AIL5</italic> (
 <italic>PsAIL5</italic>) along with low expression of 
 <italic>VP1</italic> (
 <italic>PsVP1</italic>) in subordinate embryos, while 
 <italic>PsAIL5</italic> was down-regulated along with up-regulation of 
 <italic>PsVP1</italic> in the dominant embryo. This indicated that the transition from the morphogenic phase to the maturation phase was not completed in the subordinate embryos [
