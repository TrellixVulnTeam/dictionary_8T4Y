<p id="Par25">The WOX family of TFs is comprised of multiple members, of which WUS and WOX2 are associated with the initiation of SE. WUS promotes embryonic identity and vegetative-to-embryonic transition; ectopic 
 <italic>WUS</italic> expression induces SE in 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In 
 <italic>P. glauca</italic>, PEMs transformed with 
 <italic>A. thaliana WUS</italic> produced severe phenotypes by disrupting the development of somatic embryos on the maturation medium and inhibiting germination; however 
 <italic>WUS</italic> did not induce ectopic somatic embryogenesis even in the presence of plant growth regulators [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. One of the early events in angiosperm embryogenesis is the asymmetric cell division that results in formation of an apical cell which forms the majority of the embryo, and a basal cell which forms the suspensor. 
 <italic>WOX</italic>2 becomes confined to the apical cell, thus marking the apical descendants of the zygote in 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> involved in its further development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In conifers, there is no corresponding early asymmetric cell division. However, the embryonic region of the early stage conifer embryos constitutes the corresponding tissue responsible for further development of the embryo. High expression of 
 <italic>WOX</italic>2 is associated with the early growth stages of somatic embryo in 
 <italic>P. glauca</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], 
 <italic>P. contorta</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and 
 <italic>P. pinaster</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and during late embryogeny in 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. 
 <italic>WOX</italic>2 shows evolutionary conserved function related to protoderm formation early during embryo development among seed plants; in addition, it also plays an unique role in suspensor expansion in gymnosperms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Upregulation of a 
 <italic>WOX</italic> gene was observed during the early to late stages of SE in 
 <italic>A. angustifolia</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. 
 <italic>WOX</italic>2 expression was much lower at the later embryonal stages in 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> and it was not detected in non-embryogenic cell culture, therefore it can be used as a marker for embryogenic potential [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. 
 <italic>WOX</italic>2 transcripts were found not only in the early to late embryo developmental stages but also in the vegetative tissues of seedlings and mature/older trees in 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and 
 <italic>P. contorta</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Interestingly, 
 <italic>WOX</italic>2 was found to be expressed in all developmental stages of somatic embryos in 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic> where polyembryony exists, but significantly higher levels of 
 <italic>WOX</italic>2 expression was detected in subordinate embryos, which might be related to the blocked development of the subordinate embryos [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In 
 <italic>Cunninghamia lanceolata</italic> (
 <italic>C. lanceolata</italic>, Chinese fir), however, the 
 <italic>WOX</italic>2 expression was not associated with the development of the embryos, instead 
 <italic>WOX13</italic> transcripts showed high correlation with the transition of PEMs to proembryos [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].
