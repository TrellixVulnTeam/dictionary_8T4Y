<p id="Par20">The core of understanding the SE process lies in the recognition of signals that change the genetic program of somatic tissue to induce the formation of a somatic embryo. This process involves the regulation of gene expression in the somatic tissue that form a somatic embryo and also in its surrounding tissue. The role of the genes involved in the process of initiation and the regulation of development of the somatic embryos is well characterised in model plants like 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. The key transcription factors (TFs) which regulate this process include BABYBOOM (
 <italic>BBM</italic>)
 <italic>, EMBRYOMAKER</italic> (
 <italic>EMK</italic>)
 <italic>, LEAFY COTYLEDON</italic> (
 <italic>LEC1, LEC2</italic>)
 <italic>, LEC1-LIKE</italic> (
 <italic>L1L</italic>), 
 <italic>ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3</italic> (
 <italic>ABI3</italic>) or 
 <italic>VIVIPAROUS</italic> (
 <italic>VP1</italic>), 
 <italic>FUSCA3</italic> (
 <italic>FUS3</italic>)
 <italic>, WUSCHEL</italic> (
 <italic>WUS</italic>) and the 
 <italic>WUSCHEL-related homeobox (WOX</italic>) 
 <italic>2</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These TFs share a complex association with auxin signalling pathways involving a number of gene regulatory networks where various crosstalk and feedback loops play a major role [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Seed maturation is synchronised by the complex LAFL regulatory network, which includes 
 <italic>LEC1</italic> and 
 <italic>L1L</italic> of the NF-YB gene family, and the 
 <italic>ABI3</italic>/
 <italic>VP1, FUS3</italic> and 
 <italic>LEC2</italic> containing the B3 DNA-binding domain and belonging to the B3-AFL gene family. This network positively controls genes involved in embryo/seed development and maturation and represses those required for the transition from embryonic to vegetative development, suppressing premature germination [
