 <italic>FUSCA3</italic> regulates gene expression during late embryogenesis and it acts together with 
 <italic>LEC1</italic> and 
 <italic>LEC2</italic> controlling the plant embryo development; embryos carrying 
 <italic>LEC1</italic>, 
 <italic>LEC2</italic> and 
 <italic>FUS3</italic> loss-of-function mutants partially lose their embryo identity and enter post-germinative programs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. 
 <italic>VP1</italic> is homologous to the 
 <italic>A. thaliana ABI3</italic> which is essential for seed maturation; 
 <italic>ABI3</italic> regulates the transition between embryo maturation and early seedling development and is the central regulator of ABA signalling pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. 
 <italic>FUSCA3</italic> and 
 <italic>ABI3</italic> do not induce SE on overexpression in 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Differential expression of 
 <italic>FUS</italic>3 was observed in 
 <italic>P. glauca</italic> during late SE development due to the inclusion of polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the maturation medium, which is proposed to improve the number and quality of the embryos produced [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Gene expression studies of SE in conifer species revealed the expression of 
 <italic>ABI3</italic>/
 <italic>VP1</italic> during early to late somatic embryogenesis in 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and during initiation and early SE in 
 <italic>P. glauca</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. 
 <italic>VP1</italic> is functionally conserved in 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> and seed plants, considering not only the development of embryos, but also the later stages of plant life [
