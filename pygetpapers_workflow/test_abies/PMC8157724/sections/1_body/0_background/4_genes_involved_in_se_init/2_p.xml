 <italic>LECs</italic> (
 <italic>LEC1, LEC2, LEC1</italic>-
 <italic>LIKE</italic>) are among the key regulators that promote the initiation of SE and are involved in the process of early embryo development and maturation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. LECs induce formation of somatic embryos when expressed ectopically [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Ectopic expression of 
 <italic>L1L</italic> marked the embryogenic competence in epiphyllous plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], while ectopic over-expression of 
 <italic>LEC1</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and 
 <italic>LEC2</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] was found to be associated with formation of somatic embryos in 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. By contrast, in conifers, the over-expression of 
 <italic>LEC1</italic> homolog gene did not induce ectopic somatic embryo formation in 
 <italic>P. glauca</italic> but abundance of 
 <italic>LEC1</italic> transcripts was detected in PEMs but not in (non-embryogenic) callus; however in 
 <italic>Pinus contorta</italic> (
 <italic>P. contorta</italic>, Lodgepole pine) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and 
 <italic>Pinus strobus</italic> (
 <italic>P. strobus</italic>, White pine) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], callus also showed expression of the 
 <italic>LEC1</italic> homolog. A conifer 
 <italic>LEC1</italic>-type gene (
 <italic>PaHAP3A</italic>) that is active during embryo development in 
 <italic>P. abies</italic>, did not stimulate embryonic features in vegetative tissues; however, expression of 
 <italic>PaHAP3A</italic> was observed during early to late embryo development and overexpression of 
 <italic>PaHAP3A</italic> during the maturation stage leading to the differentiation of ectopic embryos from maturing somatic embryos [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Expression of 
 <italic>LEC1</italic>/
 <italic>LEC1</italic>-
 <italic>LIKE</italic> gene was found to be associated with early to late embryo development in 
 <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> (
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic>, Scots pine) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], 
 <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic> (
 <italic>P. pinaster</italic>, Maritime pine) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and 
 <italic>Araucaria angustifolia</italic> (
 <italic>A. angustifolia</italic>, Brazilian pine) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].
