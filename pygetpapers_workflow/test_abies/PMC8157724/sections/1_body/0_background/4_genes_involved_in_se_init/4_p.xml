<p id="Par23">The 
 <italic>AINTEGUMENTA-LIKE</italic> (
 <italic>AIL</italic>) gene clade coding for TFs with the APETALA2 domain (AP2-domain) includes 
 <italic>AINTEGUMENTA</italic> (
 <italic>ANT</italic>) and 
 <italic>AIL</italic> or 
 <italic>PLETHORA</italic> (
 <italic>PLT</italic>) genes to which 
 <italic>BBM</italic> (
 <italic>PLETHORA4, PLT4</italic>) and 
 <italic>EMK</italic> (
 <italic>PLETHORA5, PLT5</italic>) belong [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genome contains eight 
 <italic>AIL/PLT</italic> genes that are expressed in the embryo and root/shoot meristems; they are required for stem cell maintenance and the functioning of meristems as well as for embryo development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. 
 <italic>BBM</italic> is one of the central regulators of the developmental potency of plant cells having diverse functions in plant cell proliferation, growth and development, and is found to be expressed in embryos and lateral root primordia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. 
 <italic>BBM</italic> acts upstream of other major TFs involved in plant embryo identity as it triggers the 
 <italic>LEC1-ABI3-FUS3-LEC2</italic> network to induce SE [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Ectopic expression of 
 <italic>BBM</italic> induces SE in 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. With reference to conifers, 
 <italic>BBM</italic> studies have been confined to larch species and 
 <italic>P. glauca</italic>. Increased expression of 
 <italic>BBM</italic> was identified during later developmental stages of embryo development in 
 <italic>Larix decidua</italic> (
 <italic>L. decidua</italic>, European larch) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In 
 <italic>P. glauca</italic>, 
 <italic>BBM</italic> was observed to be involved in the initiation of SE and was found to be expressed specifically in the early stages of embryo development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. 
 <italic>BBM</italic> along with 
 <italic>LEC</italic> were proposed to be potential molecular markers for embryogenicity by these investigations. Apart from its involvement in the process of SE in conifers, 
 <italic>BBM</italic> expression was proposed as a molecular marker for root primordia in hybrid larch (
 <italic>Larix kaempferi</italic> Ã— 
 <italic>Larix olgensis</italic>); 
 <italic>BBM</italic> showed root-specific expression compared to the gene expression levels in the stem, stem tip and leaf, which indicated that 
 <italic>BBM</italic> plays a vital role in regulating the development and growth of root during adventitious rooting in larch [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Yet another study concluded the role of 
 <italic>BBM</italic> (
 <italic>LkBBM1</italic> and 
 <italic>LkBBM2</italic>) in the regulation of adventitious root development in the same larch hybrid [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].
