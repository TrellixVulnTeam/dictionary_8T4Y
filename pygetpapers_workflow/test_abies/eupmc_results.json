Trade-offs among resistances do not necessarily hinder the use of MeJA, as clones that are constitutively more resistant to either pest, should show greater MeJA-induced resistance against the other.", "Keywords": ["Genetic correlations", "Forest pest", "Hylobius Abietis", "Ceratocystis Polonica", "Endoconidiophora Polonica", "Terpene Chemistry", "Conifer Resistance", "Resistance Trade-Offs"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8182065?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Frontiers in plant science", "authorinfo": ["Puentes A", "Zhao T", "Lundborg L", "Bj\u00f6rklund N", "Borg-Karlson AK"], "title": "Variation in Methyl Jasmonate-Induced Defense Among Norway Spruce Clones and Trade-Offs in Resistance Against a Fungal and an Insect Pest."}, "PMC8160286": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "34054889", "source": "MED", "pmid": "34054889", "pmcid": "PMC8160286", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC8160286"}, "doi": "10.3389/fpls.2021.641232", "title": "Management After Windstorm Affects the Composition of Ectomycorrhizal Symbionts of Regenerating Trees but Not Their Mycorrhizal Networks.", "authorString": "Vesel\u00e1 P, Va\u0161utov\u00e1 M, Edwards-Jon\u00e1\u0161ov\u00e1 M, Holub F, Fleischer P, Cudl\u00edn P.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Vesel\u00e1 P", "firstName": "Petra", "lastName": "Vesel\u00e1", "initials": "P", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Department of Carbon Storage in the Landscape, Global Change Research Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Brno, Czechia."}, {"affiliation": "Department of Forest Protection and Wildlife Management, Faculty of Forestry and Wood Technology, Mendel University in Brno, Brno, Czechia."}]}}, {"fullName": "Va\u0161utov\u00e1 M", "firstName": "Martina", "lastName": "Va\u0161utov\u00e1", "initials": "M", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Department of Carbon Storage in the Landscape, Global Change Research Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences, \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice, Czechia."}, {"affiliation": "Department of Botany, Faculty of Science, University of South Bohemia, \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice, Czechia."}]}}, {"fullName": "Edwards-Jon\u00e1\u0161ov\u00e1 M", "firstName": "Magda", "lastName": "Edwards-Jon\u00e1\u0161ov\u00e1", "initials": "M", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Carbon Storage in the Landscape, Global Change Research Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences, \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice, Czechia."}}}, {"fullName": "Holub F", "firstName": "Filip", "lastName": "Holub", "initials": "F", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Carbon Storage in the Landscape, Global Change Research Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences, \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice, Czechia."}}}, {"fullName": "Fleischer P", "firstName": "Peter", "lastName": "Fleischer", "initials": "P", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Integrated Forest and Landscape Protection, Faculty of Forestry, Technical University in Zvolen, Zvolen, Slovakia."}}}, {"fullName": "Cudl\u00edn P", "firstName": "Pavel", "lastName": "Cudl\u00edn", "initials": "P", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Carbon Storage in the Landscape, Global Change Research Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences, \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice, Czechia."}}}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["altmetrics", "supporting_data"]}, "journalInfo": {"volume": "12", "journalIssueId": "3109446", "dateOfPublication": "2021", "monthOfPublication": "0", "yearOfPublication": "2021", "printPublicationDate": "2021-01-01", "journal": {"title": "Frontiers in plant science", "ISOAbbreviation": "Front Plant Sci", "medlineAbbreviation": "Front Plant Sci", "NLMid": "101568200", "ISSN": "1664-462X", "ESSN": "1664-462X"}}, "pubYear": "2021", "pageInfo": "641232", "abstractText": "Due to ongoing climate change, forests are expected to face significant disturbances more frequently than in the past.

Shoots and needles showed an extensive reversible plasticity for physiological measures indicative of drought-response mechanisms, including changes in stomatal conductance (gs), shoot water potential and abscisic acid (ABA). In both tissues, the most commonly observed expression profiles in response to drought were highly correlated with the ABA levels. Still, root and needle transcriptional responses contrasted, with extensive root-specific down-regulation of growth. Comparison between previously characterized Arabidopsis thaliana L. drought-response genes and P. abies revealed both conservation and divergence of transcriptional response to drought. In P. abies, transcription factors belonging to the ABA responsive element(ABRE) binding/ABRE binding factors ABA-dependent pathway had a more limited role. These results highlight the importance of profiling both above- and belowground tissues, and provide a comprehensive framework to advance the understanding of the drought response of P. abies.

Shoots and needles showed an extensive reversible plasticity for physiological measures indicative of drought-response mechanisms, including changes in stomatal conductance (gs), shoot water potential and abscisic acid (ABA). In both tissues, the most commonly observed expression profiles in response to drought were highly correlated with the ABA levels. Still, root and needle transcriptional responses contrasted, with extensive root-specific down-regulation of growth. Comparison between previously characterized Arabidopsis thaliana L. drought-response genes and P. abies revealed both conservation and divergence of transcriptional response to drought. In P. abies, transcription factors belonging to the ABA responsive element(ABRE) binding/ABRE binding factors ABA-dependent pathway had a more limited role. These results highlight the importance of profiling both above- and belowground tissues, and provide a comprehensive framework to advance the understanding of the drought response of P. abies. The results demonstrate that a short-term, severe drought induces severe physiological responses coupled to extensive transcriptome modulation and highlight the susceptibility of Norway spruce seedlings to such drought events.", "Keywords": ["ABA", "Drought stress", "Transcriptome", "Gene Expression", "Rna-seq", "Norway Spruce", "Picea Abies"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8271197?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Tree physiology", "authorinfo": ["Haas JC", "Vergara A", "Serrano AR", "Mishra S", "Hurry V", "Street NR"], "title": "Candidate regulators and target genes of drought stress in needles and roots of Norway spruce."}, "PMC8247643": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "34220772", "source": "MED", "pmid": "34220772", "pmcid": "PMC8247643", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC8247643"}, "doi": "10.3389/fmicb.2021.685303", "title": "Deadwood-Inhabiting Bacteria Show Adaptations to Changing Carbon and Nitrogen Availability During Decomposition.", "authorString": "Tl\u00e1skal V, Baldrian P.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Tl\u00e1skal V", "firstName": "Vojt\u011bch", "lastName": "Tl\u00e1skal", "initials": "V", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Laboratory of Environmental Microbiology, Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Praha, Czechia."}}}, {"fullName": "Baldrian P", "firstName": "Petr", "lastName": "Baldrian", "initials": "P", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Laboratory of Environmental Microbiology, Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Praha, Czechia."}}}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["altmetrics", "supporting_data"]}, "journalInfo": {"volume": "12", "journalIssueId": "3109445", "dateOfPublication": "2021", "monthOfPublication": "0", "yearOfPublication": "2021", "printPublicationDate": "2021-01-01", "journal": {"title": "Frontiers in microbiology", "ISOAbbreviation": "Front Microbiol", "medlineAbbreviation": "Front Microbiol", "NLMid": "101548977", "ISSN": "1664-302X", "ESSN": "1664-302X"}}, "pubYear": "2021", "pageInfo": "685303", "abstractText": "Deadwood decomposition is responsible for a significant amount of carbon (C) turnover in natural forests.
