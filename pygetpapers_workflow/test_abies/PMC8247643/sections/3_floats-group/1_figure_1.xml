  <p>Phylogenetic tree of strains with sequenced genomes in the context of representative sequences of the 87 most abundant OTUs from 
   <italic>Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies</italic>, and 
   <italic>Abies alba</italic> deadwood based on the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene. Strains are denoted with strain IDs and genus names and cover the majority of the dominant bacterial phyla in deadwood. Phyla are labeled with different colors, and taxonomy follows the SILVA 138 database. The most abundant bacteria are based on the study of Tl√°skal et al. (
