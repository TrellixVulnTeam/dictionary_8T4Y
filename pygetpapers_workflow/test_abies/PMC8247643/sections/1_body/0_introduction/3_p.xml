<p>While culture-independent methods may provide the best picture of bacterial community composition and gene expression, the characterization of isolates of dominant bacteria represents the best approach for the characterization of their phenotypes and traits (Lladó et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The genome sequencing of bacterial isolates has helped distinguish the functional guilds of decomposers and opportunists within soil bacteria (Lladó et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). While metagenome analysis may help predict bacterial traits based on the construction of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs, Tláskal et al., 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2021a</xref>), this approach has multiple limitations. MAGs are mostly incomplete, subject to potential contamination by non-target sequences, and often difficult to link to existing 16S rRNA gene sequences and, as such, exact bacterial identities (Bowers et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Furthermore, the ability to recover dominant bacteria as MAGs is also variable (Nayfach et al., 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). All of these limitations can be overcome by isolate characterization, which also offers the opportunity for phenotype screening in cultures (Madin et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
