<p>The decomposition of deadwood in forests is a complex process during which plant polymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are exploited by members of the microbial community. Since the deadwood microbiome is dominated by fungi, their cell wall constituents represent another important resource, especially in the late phases of decomposition. Deadwood is estimated to contain 8% of the total global forest carbon (C) stock (Pan et al., 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Martin et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), making it an important source of carbon. However, the degree of the recalcitrance of C in deadwood components varies considerably and changes over time with the progress of decomposition. Fungi and bacteria produce a wide array of enzymes to access complex C sources, typically termed carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes, Berlemont and Martiny, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). C-source niche partitioning in the utilization of C compounds is observed among microbial taxa (Gallardo et al., 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), as well as various levels of opportunism in C acquisition (Lladó et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), where released degradation products may be utilized by microbes incapable of decomposition without the need to invest in enzyme production (Berlemont and Martiny, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In contrast to C, the initial nitrogen (N) content in deadwood is extremely low (typically &lt;1%), which leads to strong N limitation of microbial growth and substrate colonization (Tláskal et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). N accumulates in deadwood during decomposition either due to transport via the mycelium of ectomycorrhizal and soil foraging fungi (Philpott et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) or via the activity of the diazotrophic bacterial community (Rinne et al., 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Tláskal et al., 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2021a</xref>). Such an increase gradually alleviates N limitation, leading to a more favorable C:N ratio of the whole habitat (Weedon et al., 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).
