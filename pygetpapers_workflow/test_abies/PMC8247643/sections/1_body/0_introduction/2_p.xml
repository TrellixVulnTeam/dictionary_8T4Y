<p>A previous study analyzing the decomposition of 
 <italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic> deadwood through metatranscriptome analysis showed the major role of fungi in C release, as demonstrated by their dominance in CAZyme production (Tláskal et al., 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2021a</xref>). Notably, even the composition of the bacterial community in deadwood is heavily affected by fungi due to their primary access to C resources (Odriozola et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). The effect of fungi on bacteria might be direct (such as through antibiosis) or indirect through substrate acidification, allowing for the selection of acid-tolerant bacterial taxa (Valášková et al., 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Christofides et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Johnston et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Fungal biomass formation also represents a nutritional basis for several bacteria (Brabcová et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; López-Mondéjar et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Such mycophagous bacteria developed enzymes for chitin degradation to overcome N limitation by feeding on fungal biomass containing N-rich chitin and chitosan (Uroz et al., 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Brabcová et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Starke et al., 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). As a result of fungal modulation and changing conditions in the substrate, the composition and abundance of the bacterial community in deadwood change over time showing an increase of bacterial biomass and taxa succession toward community similar to that in soil (Rinta-Kanto et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Tláskal et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Among the factors influencing bacterial community composition in deadwood, the most often reported are pH, the C:N ratio, and water content (Folman et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Hoppe et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Tláskal et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Moll et al., 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Mieszkin et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), but the biopolymer composition and fungal abundance are also important (Rinta-Kanto et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Odriozola et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Due to limited knowledge of the functional traits of deadwood bacteria, it is unclear how exactly these factors influence the members of the bacterial community or vice versa and which adaptations make bacterial species successful at various stages of deadwood decomposition.
