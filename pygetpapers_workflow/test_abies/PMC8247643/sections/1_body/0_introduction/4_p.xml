<p>The present study isolated the dominant bacteria from decomposing deadwood to describe their functional traits through genome sequencing and phenotype analysis and used this information to explain the preference of specific bacterial taxa for certain stages of deadwood decomposition. We focused on the bacterial ability to release C from plant and fungal polymers and bacterial assimilatory and dissimilatory N cycling pathways. We expect dominant bacteria to show differing occurrences throughout deadwood decomposition stages, driven by substrate availability and their metabolic ability to be constrained by taxonomic identity.</p>
