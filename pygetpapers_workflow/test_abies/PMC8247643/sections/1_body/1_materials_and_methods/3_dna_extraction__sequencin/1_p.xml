<p>Selected bacterial strains were cultivated in 50 mL of GY-VL55 liquid medium shaken in Erlenmeyer flasks (Lladó et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) for 2 weeks at 23°C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and DNA was extracted by an ArchivePure DNA Yeast and Gram-+ Kit (5 Prime, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA was sheared by a Bioruptor Pico sonication device (Diagenode, Belgium) to an average length of 550 bp, and sequencing adapters were ligated by the TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Library Prep Kit (Illumina Inc., USA). Ligated libraries were sequenced in-house on the Illumina MiSeq platform.
