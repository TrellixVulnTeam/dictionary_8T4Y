<p>The activity of the cell wall-associated fraction of enzymes was measured in cells after 2 weeks of incubation in triplicate in 50 mL of liquid GY-VL55 medium as described previously (Lasa et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). To assess the ability to grow on cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose medium (CMC) was prepared (5 g L
 <sup>−1</sup> CMC, 2 g L
 <sup>−1</sup> yeast extract, 15 g L
 <sup>−1</sup> agar, pH 5). Plates were incubated at 24°C for 2 weeks. After incubation, 12 mL of 1% Congo Red was poured onto each plate, staining was performed for 30 min, the Congo Red was replaced with 12 mL of 1 M NaCl, the NaCl was left for 30 min, the NaCl was replaced with 12 mL of H
 <sub>2</sub>O, and the H
 <sub>2</sub>O was left overnight. The presence of a halo around the colonies indicated CMC utilization.
