<p>This study was conducted in the Žofínský Prales National Nature Reserve, a temperate unmanaged forest in the south of the Czech Republic (48°39′57″N, 14°42′24″E). The core zone of the forest reserve (42 ha) has never been managed, and any human intervention ceased in 1838 when it was declared a reserve. This reserve thus represents a rare fragment of European temperate virgin forest with deadwood left to spontaneously decompose. The reserve is situated at 730–830 m above sea level and the bedrock is almost homogeneous and consists of finely to medium-grainy porphyritic and biotite granite. The annual average rainfall is 866 mm, and the annual average temperature is 6.2°C (Anderson-Teixeira et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). At present, the reserve is covered by a mixed forest where 
 <italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic> predominates in all diameter classes (51.5% of the total living wood volume), followed by 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> (42.8%) and 
 <italic>Abies alba</italic> (4.8%). The mean living tree volume is 690 m
 <sup>3</sup> h
 <sup>−1</sup>, and the volume of coarse woody debris (logs, represented by tree trunks and their fragments) ranges from 102 to 310 m
 <sup>3</sup> h
 <sup>−1</sup> with an average of 208 m
 <sup>3</sup> h
 <sup>−1</sup> (Král et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Šamonil et al., 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Logs are repeatedly surveyed, and the approximate age of each log, the cause of death (stem breakage, windthrow, etc.), and status before downing (fresh, decomposed) is known.
