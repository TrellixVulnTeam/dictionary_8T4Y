<p>Decomposing wood samples were collected as described previously (Tláskal et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Briefly, dead tree trunks (coarse woody debris; CWD) of 
 <italic>F. sylvatica, P. abies</italic>, and 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> with breast height diameters between 30 and 100 cm at the time of downing were chosen to evenly represent all decay lengths (age classes) of deadwood and the span of the diameter range. Trees decomposing as standing snags were omitted to exclude CWD with unclear decay lengths. The CWD decay length ranged from &lt;5 to &gt;38 years. In October 2013, four samples were obtained by drilling with an electrical drill vertically covering sapwood and heartwood along the whole decomposing stem. Part of the material was used for the description of fungal and bacterial communities and wood chemistry (Baldrian et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Tláskal et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), while another part was used for the isolation of bacteria. For this latter category of subsamples, wood chips from each stem were pooled together and transported to the laboratory, where they were cooled until the next day. Approximately 2 g of wood material were shaken with 15 mL of Ringer solution for 2 h and this suspension was diluted 10
 <sup>4</sup>–10
 <sup>6</sup>×. Five hundred microlitres of each dilution were plated on nutrient-limited NB medium (0.26 g L
 <sup>−1</sup> nutrient broth, 15 g L
 <sup>−1</sup> agar, pH 5) and WYA4 medium (0.1 g L
 <sup>−1</sup> yeast extract, 15 g L
 <sup>−1</sup> agar, pH 5, Valášková et al., 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) with cycloheximide (50 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>). Occurrences of bacterial colonies were recorded on Petri dishes incubated at 24°C for 8 weeks and marked with a marker indicating the week of the first appearance. Colony PCR was used to infer the taxonomy of the selected strains that appeared during the course of incubation. PCR premix and cycling conditions were as follows: 2.5 μL of 10× buffer for DyNAzyme DNA Polymerase; 0.75 μL of DyNAzyme II DNA polymerase (2 u μL
 <sup>−1</sup>); 0.75 μL of BSA (20 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>); 0.5 μL of PCR Nucleotide Mix (10 mM); 1 μL of primer eub530f (10 μM, 5′-GTG CCA GCM GCN GCG G); 1 μL of primer eub1100br (10 μM, 5'-GGG TTN CGN TCG TTG, Lane, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>) and sterile ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O up to 25 μL, with amplification started at 94°C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 62°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min and a final setting of 72°C for 10 min. Sanger sequencing was performed from the reverse primer as an external service. The obtained sequences were compared by BLASTn with bacterial 16S rRNA-based community data from the same deadwood objects that were used for isolation (Tláskal et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Bacterial strains with high similarity (&gt;97%) and coverage (&gt;90%) relative to the most abundant deadwood OTUs were selected for further cultivation. The strains that were cultivable on laboratory media in subsequent passages and those that exhibited sufficient growth and biomass production were used for genome sequencing and culturing tests. By this approach, we were able to select 18 bacterial strains with high similarity to highly abundant bacterial OTUs from the studied deadwood.
