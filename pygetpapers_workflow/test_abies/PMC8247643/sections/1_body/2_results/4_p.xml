<p>Functional analysis of the identified CAZymes showed the specific C sources targeted by the strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Genes for cellulose degradation were present in three copies of cellulase GH6 in the genome of 
 <italic>Glaciihabitans</italic> strain 435. 
 <italic>Mucilaginibacter</italic> strain 454 and 
 <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> strain 22 each contained two copies of cellulases. Other strains with a single copy of a cellulase gene included both 
 <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> strains, both 
 <italic>Caballeronia</italic> strains, both 
 <italic>Sodalis</italic> strains, and 
 <italic>Mesorhizobium</italic> strain 380. An increased number of chitinase genes were present in 
 <italic>Granulicella</italic> strain 53 and 
 <italic>Edaphobacter</italic> strain 441 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7 and 5, respectively). 
 <italic>Mucilaginibacter</italic> strain 454 contained three genes for enzymes involved in chitin degradation, and 
 <italic>Luteibacter</italic> strain 328 contained two chitinases. Both 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains encoded a single chitinase gene, and genes encoding enzymes targeting chitin were present in both 
 <italic>Variovorax</italic> strains, 
 <italic>Caballeronia</italic> strain 276 and 
 <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> strain 22. An increased number of hemicellulases were present in two 
 <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> strains, 
 <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> strain 22, 
 <italic>Mucilaginibacter</italic> strain 454, and 
 <italic>Luteibacter</italic> strain 328. CAZymes for the labile substrates cellobiose and xylobiose and α-glucanases were present throughout the isolated strains without evident differences. CAZymes for other labile substrates, pectinases, β-glucanases, and glycoconjugate-degrading enzymes, were preferentially found in high-CAZy-containing 
 <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> strains, 
 <italic>Mucilaginibacter</italic> strain 454, 
 <italic>Glaciihabitans</italic> strain 435, and 
 <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> strain 22. Two 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains contained lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase genes from CAZy family AA10 for the oxidation of a broad range of polysaccharides. Some of the low-CAZy genomes contained genes for C uptake from alternative sources: the 
 <italic>mxaF</italic> gene for methanol dehydrogenase, which oxidizes methanol, was present in 
 <italic>Variovorax</italic> and 
 <italic>Caballeronia</italic> (both 
 <italic>Burkholderiales</italic>), and four copies of this gene were present in 
 <italic>Bradyrhizobium</italic> strain 411. 
 <italic>Mesorhizobium</italic> together with 
 <italic>Caballeronia</italic> contained genes for soluble diiron monooxygenases.
