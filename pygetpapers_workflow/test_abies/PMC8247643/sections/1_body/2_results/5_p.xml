 <italic>Luteibacter</italic> strain 328 showed by far the most active cell wall-associated enzymatic fraction. Except for 
 <italic>Luteibacter</italic>, chitinase activity was highest in 
 <italic>Bradyrhizobium</italic> strains, 
 <italic>Variovorax</italic> strains, and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains. Strains of 
 <italic>Pseudomonas, Variovorax</italic>, and 
 <italic>Luteibacter</italic> were not able to grow on CMC medium but displayed cellobiohydrolase and Î²-glucosidase activities suitable for the degradation of cellulose-derived oligosaccharides (
