<p>The selected sequenced strains binned to 0.7% of bacterial OTUs, representing 15.3 ± 0.8% of bacteria in CWD samples (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>; 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The phylogeny of 86 dominant OTUs in the whole amplicon dataset, i.e., those representing &gt;0.5% sequences in &gt;10 CWD samples, showed that we retrieved members of the top five deadwood bacterial phyla and classes of 
 <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>. These were 
 <italic>Acidobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>; 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Members of other phyla that represented only a small minority among the dominant OTUs–
 <italic>Firmicutes</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1), class 
 <italic>Polyangia</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1), 
 <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2), 
 <italic>Verrucomicrobia</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5), and WPS-2 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1)–either were not isolated or failed to grow in subsequent cultures. Except for the strains of 
 <italic>Bradyrhizobium</italic> (1.5%), each genome represented on average &lt;1% of bacteria across all CWD samples. Up to 26.7% of bacteria were represented in the best-covered CWD samples (
