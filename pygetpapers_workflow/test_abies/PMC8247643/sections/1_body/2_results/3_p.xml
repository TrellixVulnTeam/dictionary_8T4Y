<p>CAZy analysis showed a considerable level of variation in the carbon utilization traits among strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Four strains were distinct in terms of high CAZyme counts and diversity: two 
 <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> (
 <italic>Edaphobacter</italic> strain 441 and 
 <italic>Granulicella</italic> strain 53), 
 <italic>Mucilaginibacter</italic> strain 454, and 
 <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> strain 22. The 
 <italic>Granulicella</italic> strain showed the most CAZymes (
 <italic>n</italic> = 187 in 72 CAZy families), representing 3.7% of its total genes. In contrast, six members of the genera 
 <italic>Variovorax, Pseudomonas</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bradyrhizobium</italic> contained only 62–75 CAZymes in 28–35 CAZy families, representing 1% of their total genes (
