<p>Genome-sequenced bacterial strains differed in their tendency to associate with deadwood of a certain decay length, as demonstrated by the mapping of metagenome reads from decomposing 
 <italic>F. sylvatica</italic>. Mapping showed that several strains were restricted to very fresh deadwood (&lt;4 years of decomposition), while others tended to increase in abundance at later decomposition stages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The isolates 
 <italic>Glaciihabitans</italic> strain 435, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strain 358, 
 <italic>Sodalis</italic> strains 23, and 96 and 
 <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> strain 22 were significantly more abundant in the fresh CWD, while several other strains also showed high abundances in the fresh deadwood (
 <italic>Edaphobacter</italic> strain 441, 
 <italic>Caballeronia</italic> strain 276 and 
 <italic>Mucilaginibacter</italic> strain 454) but only inhabited certain CWD samples from the youngest age class. The abundance of other strains, including two 
 <italic>Bradyrhizobium</italic> strains and 
 <italic>Rhizobiales</italic> strain 265, peaked later during decomposition. Notably, the aforementioned 
 <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic> represent bacteria with the highest abundance in the examined metagenomes (
