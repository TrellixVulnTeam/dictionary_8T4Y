<p>Isolation yielded 959 isolates, with 
 <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic> being the most represented class, followed by the class

 <italic>Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria</italic>, and

 <italic>Mucilaginibacter</italic> (7%) and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (7%, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). Isolates clustered into 467 OTUs (&gt;99% similarity) and were binned to 4.5% of OTUs from the 16S rRNA amplicon study from the same CWD samples published previously (Tláskal et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The isolates represented on average 33.5 ± 1.3% of bacteria in a CWD sample. The youngest age class of deadwood, comprising CWD samples with a decay length &lt;5 years, was most represented by the isolates (38.8 ± 2.6%).
