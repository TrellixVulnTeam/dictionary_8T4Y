<p>Nitrogen cycling-related genes showed a higher occurrence in the genomes of 
 <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic> and 
 <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). 
 <italic>Bradyrhizobium</italic> strain 78, 
 <italic>Mesorhizobium</italic> strain 380, and the two 
 <italic>Sodalis</italic> strains contained the nitrogenase operon 
 <italic>nifHDK</italic>, which enables nitrogen fixation. Genomes of both 
 <italic>Sodalis</italic> strains and 
 <italic>Mesorhizobium</italic> strain 380 showed a combination of nitrogenase genes and cellulase genes. The two 
 <italic>Caballeronia</italic> and the two 
 <italic>Sodalis</italic> strains contained an increased number of genes for dissimilatory nitrate to nitrite reduction. Assimilatory nitrate reduction genes seem to be limited only to the presence of the 
 <italic>nasB</italic> gene in a restricted number of taxa. In contrast, the assimilatory nitrite reduction genes 
 <italic>nirAB</italic> were present in almost all isolated strains. Denitrification steps leading to the production of N
 <sub>2</sub>–reduction of nitric oxide and nitrous oxide–were not detected in any genome. However, several genomes (especially those in the genus 
 <italic>Sodalis</italic>) contained genes for dissimilatory nitrite reduction (
 <italic>nrfC</italic> or 
 <italic>nrfD</italic>), directing N flow into dissimilatory nitrate reduction to the ammonia pathway (DNRA). Similar to denitrification genes, nitrification genes, including those that allow the oxidation of ammonia, were missing in the bacterial genomes examined.
