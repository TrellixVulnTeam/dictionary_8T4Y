<p>We characterized members of the most abundant deadwood bacterial taxa 
 <italic>Acidobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>. These dominant phyla appear to be generally occurring in deadwood (Johnston et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Although our functional assignment of genes was done as accurately as possible, it should be noted that, in some cases, one CAZy family of enzymes can target different substrates (e.g., GH6; such genes found in 
 <italic>Glaciihabitans</italic> displayed the highest similarity to known endo-β-1,4-glucanases). Therefore, we show the most probable functions of the CAZymes. Among cultivated bacteria, we identified strains with an increased potential for the utilization of complex carbohydrates, including cellulose, chitin, hemicelluloses, and pectin. These strains belong to the phyla 
 <italic>Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria</italic>, and the genus 
 <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> from the 
 <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic>. The strong hydrolytic capabilities of these taxa have been reported previously for some of the soil-inhabiting groups (Uroz et al., 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Větrovský et al., 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; López-Mondéjar et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Specifically, 
 <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> were identified as efficient decomposers of carbohydrate biopolymers (Lladó et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). This also corresponds to the identified chitinase activity (Lladó et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and degradation of fungal mycelium by 
 <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> including genus 
 <italic>Granulicella</italic> (López-Mondéjar et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). This trait was supported by an increased number of chitinase genes in the cultivated 
 <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> in our study.
