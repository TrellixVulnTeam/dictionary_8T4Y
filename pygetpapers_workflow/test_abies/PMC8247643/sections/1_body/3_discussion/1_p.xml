<p>Using prolonged cultivation, it is possible to capture a wide diversity of bacteria, including slow-growing taxa, with potentially important ecological functions (Sait et al., 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Lladó et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Our isolation, which resulted in 959 deadwood bacterial isolates, was partly redundant, with many taxa repeatedly captured (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>), yet due to the presence of several members of dominant deadwood OTUs, the collection represented a relatively large portion of the bacterial community—on average, approximately one-third of the bacteria present in CWD. In contrast to culture-independent genome resolving, isolation provides complete data about the genome content of a particular strain without the threat of chimeric genomes (Shaiber and Eren, 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) and represents a suitable approach for fully describing the role of key members of the microbiome (Valášková et al., 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).
