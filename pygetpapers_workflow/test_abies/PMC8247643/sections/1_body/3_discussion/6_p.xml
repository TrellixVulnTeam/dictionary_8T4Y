<p>Bacterial community composition was shown to undergo a significant change between the early and late decomposition stages at a deadwood age of ~15 years (Tl√°skal et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Here, several strains showed a preference for very young and almost intact deadwood (though there was a high variation among individual fresh stems), while the same strains were less abundant in the subsequent decomposition stages. Conversely, strains that reached the highest abundance in the late decomposition phase were considerably less abundant in fresh deadwood. Bacteria involved in N
 <sub>2</sub> fixation occur in fresh deadwood as well as in the following decomposition phases, showing the importance of this activity throughout decomposition. As the most readily available plant biopolymers are gradually depleted during decomposition, bacteria with genes for chitin degradation might switch to utilizing C from fungal biomass. Mycophagous bacteria such as 
 <italic>Granulicella, Luteibacter</italic>, and 
 <italic>Burkholderiales</italic> indeed tended to be more abundant in the later decomposition stages when fungal biomass in deadwood increases and starts to represent a relatively easily accessible source of both C and N.
