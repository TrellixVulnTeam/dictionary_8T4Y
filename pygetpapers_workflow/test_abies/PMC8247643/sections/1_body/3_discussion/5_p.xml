<p>The ability to fix N
 <sub>2</sub> might explain the association of 
 <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic> with low-N conditions and their positive correlation with the C:N ratio (Rinta-Kanto et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Mieszkin et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Previous studies detected the order 
 <italic>Rhizobiales</italic> (
 <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic>) as one of the abundant members in the deadwood community (Hervé et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and showed the presence of nitrogenase genes assigned to this group (Hoppe et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In line with this, we cultivated two 
 <italic>Rhizobiales</italic> strains containing the nitrogenase 
 <italic>nifHDK</italic> operon. The other two nitrogen fixers are enterobacteria from the genus 
 <italic>Sodalis</italic>, and both are closely related to 
 <italic>Sodalis</italic> insect endosymbionts that lack nitrogenase genes (Tláskal et al., 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2021b</xref>). After almost 40 years, non-symbiotic N
 <sub>2</sub>-fixing 
 <italic>Sodalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Rhizobiales</italic> strains widen a small group of cultivated deadwood diazotrophic bacteria successfully retrieved from naturally decomposing CWD (Seidler et al., 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">1972</xref>; Spano et al., 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>). 
 <italic>Sodalis</italic> strains were most abundant in early decomposition when the N limitation was most severe, and the abundance of 
 <italic>Rhizobiales</italic> peaked later. Deadwood seems to be a hotspot of non-symbiotic N
 <sub>2</sub> fixation, and these abundant taxa contribute to the N enrichment of the substrate (Brunner and Kimmins, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Tláskal et al., 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2021a</xref>). Notably, three out of four nitrogen-fixing strains (the two 
 <italic>Sodalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Mesorhizobium</italic> strains) also contained a single cellulase gene, which suggests that these strains might be independent in recalcitrant substrates utilization. Examination of other N cycle pathways shows that genes encoding dissimilatory steps are less common than those encoding assimilatory steps. Specifically, 
 <italic>Sodalis</italic> strains (and partly 
 <italic>Caballeronia</italic> strains) contain genes for DNRA, enabling the transformation of oxidized forms of N into ammonium. The balance between DNRA and denitrification is crucial for the soil N budget (Nelson et al., 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), and a similar mechanism might exist in deadwood. The absence of complete denitrification and the preferred DNRA pathway thus prevents the loss of scarce nitrogen (Tláskal et al., 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2021a</xref>).
