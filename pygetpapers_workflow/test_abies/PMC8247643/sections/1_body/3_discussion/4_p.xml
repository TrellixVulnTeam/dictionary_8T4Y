<p>The bacteria from the classes 
 <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic> and 
 <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic>, which are low in carbohydrate-active enzymes, showed the presence of genes for putative methanol oxidation. Genes for soluble diiron monooxygenases in 
 <italic>Caballeronia</italic> and 
 <italic>Mesorhizobium</italic> point to oxidation of other low-molecular-mass C sources rather than performing methanotrophy which was not described for these taxa (Leahy et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Altogether, the presence of these genes suggests that 
 <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic> and 
 <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic> utilize simple C compounds generated during lignin decomposition by fungi (Filley et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Lenhart et al., 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Methylotrophy of 
 <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic> is sometimes accompanied by diazotrophic activity (Vorob'ev et al., 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Changes in bacterial deadwood community composition are tightly linked with changes in the pH, water content, and C:N ratio of the substrate (Hoppe et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Tláskal et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The C:N ratio of fresh deadwood is very high and decreases during decomposition, which is a result of N accumulation partially through fungal translocation and mainly through bacterial N
 <sub>2</sub> fixation (Rayner and Boddy, 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Rinne et al., 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Tláskal et al., 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2021a</xref>).
