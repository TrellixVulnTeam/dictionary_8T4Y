<p>Different C utilization strategies were described for soil habitats in which 
 <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> served as decomposers with a high number of expressed CAZymes, while 
 <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> were recognized as opportunists relying on C uptake from other labile sources (Llad√≥ et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). With the high taxonomic and functional overlap in these soil groups, we can identify two distinct strategies of abundant deadwood bacterial taxa: degraders with high decomposition potential and less generalist bacteria filling their C needs by alternative source utilization and mycophagy. Moreover, the latter are active in N cycling, and their presence might be beneficial for the total microbial community due to N
 <sub>2</sub> fixation. Metabolically diverse bacteria thus show specific adaptations to challenging deadwood habitats and complement deadwood decomposition driven by fungi through N enrichment.
