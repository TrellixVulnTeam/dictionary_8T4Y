<p>In contrast to general degraders, deadwood 
 <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic> and most 
 <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic> harbored lower numbers of CAZymes, indicating a narrow spectrum of potential C sources. The least CAZy-equipped strains were those assigned to the genera 
 <italic>Variovorax, Pseudomonas</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bradyrhizobium</italic>. Despite the lack of CAZymes for plant-derived compound degradation, such as cellulose or hemicellulose, these low-CAZy strains have the potential to compensate for this narrow range by decomposition of fungal biomass. Adherence to fungal hyphae or enrichment in the presence of fungi were repeatedly described for 
 <italic>Burkholderiales</italic>, suggesting a mycophagous lifestyle for these strains (Valášková et al., 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Hervé et al., 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Brabcová et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Starke et al., 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Our 
 <italic>Variovorax</italic> and 
 <italic>Caballeronia</italic> strains from 
 <italic>Burkholderiales</italic> indeed contained chitosanase and 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminidase genes, respectively, which are involved in the degradation of the main fungal structural biopolymers chitin and chitosan. The genus 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> showed a similar chitinase gene presence to strains of the same genus involved in the decomposition of fungal biomass (Starke et al., 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The chitinolytic activity of the membrane-bound enzymes was measured for the 
 <italic>Bradyrhizobium</italic> strains and the 
 <italic>Luteibacter</italic> strain. 
 <italic>Luteibacter</italic> displayed the highest chitinase activity in this study, and its mycolytic and cellulolytic activity was described previously (López-Mondéjar et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Mieszkin et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>); 
 <italic>Luteibacter</italic> additionally showed a generally high activity of membrane-bound enzymes (Lasa et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).
