<p>In addition to changes in resistance to pine weevil damage and blue-stain fungus infection, we also found differences in terpene chemistry among non-treated and MeJA-treated plants. A total of 15 terpene compounds were identified, including monoterpenes [(+)-α-pinene, (−)-α-pinene, (−)-β-pinene, (+)-β-pinene, (+)-3-carene, (−)-β-phellandrene, (−)-limonene, (+)-limonene, camphene, and myrcene], sesquiterpenes (calarene) and a few diterpenes (neocembrene, thunbergene, thunbergol, and geranyllinalool). Total terpene chemistry (absolute amounts) was significantly different between plants treated with 0 and 50 mM MeJA (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Treatment with MeJA shifted terpene chemistry mostly across the first axis of variation (PC 1), with larger increases in the amounts of compounds such as (−)-α-pinene, (−)-β-pinene, (+)-limonene, β-phellandrene, camphene, myrcene, and calarene (

 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). An increase in (+)-3-carene was observed across the second axis of variation for some clones (e.g., clones 6 and 9,

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Tables 5</xref>,

 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>), total terpene levels differed significantly among clones irrespective of treatment (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Table 2</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Among-clone differences explained most of the variation in terpene chemistry rather than MeJA treatment (
