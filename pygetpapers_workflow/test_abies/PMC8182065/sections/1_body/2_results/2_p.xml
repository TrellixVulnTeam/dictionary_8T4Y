<p>Norway spruce plants that were treated with 50 mM MeJA received on average 76% less pine weevil damage, and experienced 55% shorter lesion lengths compared to those in the control group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). However, the decrease in insect damage and fungal infection observed for plants in the MeJA treatment tended to differ among clones (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). For area debarked, there was a statistically significant MeJA Ã— clone interaction (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), while for lesion length it was close to significant at the 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.1 level (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Overall, there was greater variation among clones in the amount of pine weevil damage and fungal infection when plants were not induced (0 mM MeJA) relative to when they were MeJA-induced, especially for lesion length (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A,B</xref>, compare 50 mM MeJA for the two variables). In other words, clones responded more similarly to MeJA treatment in terms of lesion length than area debarked. Nonetheless, some clones such as numbers 2 and 7 showed little change in lesion length when treated with MeJA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).
