<p>The separation and identification of volatiles was made on a 2DGC-MS Agilent instrument (7890A GC; 5975C MS), equipped with a DB-5 column followed by a Cyclodextrin-β column (both Agilent; 30 m, ID 0.25 mm, and film thickness 0.25 μm). Samples were injected splitless into an injector temperature of 250°C, isothermal, and with a purge time of 1 min. The GC oven program started at 40°C, and was kept isothermal for 3 min, followed by a temperature ramp of 3°C min
 <sup>–1</sup>, up to 100°C, followed by a second ramp of 5°C min
 <sup>–1</sup> up to 250°C, and then isothermal for 1 min. The transfer line temperature to the second GC was isothermal at 40°C.
