<p>The temperature program in the second GC was isothermal at 58°C for 50 min, then ramped from 100°C min
 <sup>–1</sup> up to 200°C, and kept for 3.5 min. On the second column, the enantiomers of α-pinene, β-pinene and limonene were separated. The first two substances were cut from the first to the second column between 8 and 14 min, and evaluated on m/z 93 (their most abundant fragment). On the first column, the coeluting limonene and β-phellandrene were quantified on the amount of m/z 68 compared to limonene standard (β-phellandrene does not give this fragment). These were in the same run as the other chiral compounds, cut from 15 to 18 min on GC1, for limonene to be evaluated on m/z 68 on GC2.
