<p>The terpene hydrocarbons were identified by comparing retention times and mass spectra with available authentic standards, or by comparing retention indexes (RIs) and mass spectra with Massfinder 3 (Hochmuth Scientific Consulting, Germany) and the reference libraries of NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology, United States). The absolute amounts of terpenes were calculated relative to the internal standards, and expressed as μg g
 <sup>–1</sup> dry wt. The relative amounts of terpenes were calculated as the ratio of the area of each peak to the sum of all the areas of terpene hydrocarbons in a defined GC fraction, and expressed as percentages.
