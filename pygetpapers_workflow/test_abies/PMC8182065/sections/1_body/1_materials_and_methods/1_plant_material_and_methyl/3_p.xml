<p>Treatment of Norway spruce plants with MeJA followed 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Zas et al. (2014)</xref>. Briefly, MeJA (95%, Sigma-Aldrich, ref. 392707) was first dissolved in ethanol, then deionized water was added to this mixture to achieve a final ethanol concentration of 2.5% (v:v). The solution was shaken vigorously until a uniform milky emulsion was obtained, and then transferred to a spraying bottle (0.5 L plastic bottle; Part No. 62526011, Canyon, United Kingdom). Spraying was conducted so that the solution reached and covered the entire plant in each pot. Each plant received approximately 1 ml of either 25 or 50 mM MeJA solution. The control group (0 mM MeJA) was treated in the same way but only with carrier solution (deionized water and ethanol). Plants were treated twice, once on April 28th and then again on May 14th, 2014. To avoid any potential defense induction of neighboring non-treated controls, MeJA-treated and control plants were kept separately from the first application of MeJA until planting occurred.
