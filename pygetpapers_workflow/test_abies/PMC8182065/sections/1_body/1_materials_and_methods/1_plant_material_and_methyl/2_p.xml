<p>To examine constitutive and MeJA-induced responses in Norway spruce clones, plants from each clone were assigned to either a control or a MeJA treatment group. According to the Krutzsch index (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Krutzsch, 1973</xref>), clones were at a similar developmental stage (between 0 and 3, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) when MeJA was applied. We chose two concentrations of MeJA (25 and 50 mM) based on previous studies in our group and on the size of the plants. Smaller Norway spruce plants (average height: 20 cm, average diameter: 3 mm) have often been treated with concentrations ranging from 5 to 15 mM MeJA (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen Y. et al., 2020</xref>). Larger and thicker plants (average heights above 25 cm, and diameters above 5 mm) as those used in our experiment, have been treated with higher concentrations (25 mM MeJA,

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Fedderwitz et al., 2016</xref>). For the pine weevil experiment, 20 replicates per clone (
 <italic>n</italic> = 9 clones) were included in each of the three treatments (0, 25 and 50 mM MeJA). However, clone number 5 had three individuals less than all the other clones from the beginning, and plants in the 50 mM MeJA treatment for clone number 1 were not planted in the field (see Semi-field experiment description). The total sample sizes for 0, 25, and 50 mM MeJA treatments were 180, 177, and 160 plants, respectively. For the fungus-inoculation experiment, 5 plants per clone were included in each of the three treatments. Clone numbers 3 and 6 had one less plant, and clones 4 and 7 had two less plants from the beginning, and for clone number 1 plants in the 50 mM MeJA were not planted in the field. The total sample sizes for 0, 25, and 50 mM MeJA treatments were 43, 45, and 36 plants, respectively.
