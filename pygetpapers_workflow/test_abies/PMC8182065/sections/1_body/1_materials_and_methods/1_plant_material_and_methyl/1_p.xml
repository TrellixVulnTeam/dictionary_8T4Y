<p>In August 2011, cuttings were made from nine clones (clone identification numbers: 1 to 9 hereafter) of Norway spruce [
 <italic>P. abies</italic> (L.) Karst.]. These clones originated from the clonal archive material produced by The Forestry Research Institute of Sweden (Skogforsk, series S21K0420-), as part of their breeding trials for Norway spruce. Cuttings were individually planted in 6.5 cm-sized pots, and allowed to grow at the growing facilities in Skogforsk (Ekebo, 55.9°N; outside of Svalöv in southern Sweden) first, and later at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU, Uppsala, 59°49′N, Sweden) until the start of the experiment in the summer of 2014. By then, plants had reached an average height of 32.6 cm (standard error: ±0.4), and a diameter of 6.3 mm (±0.08;
