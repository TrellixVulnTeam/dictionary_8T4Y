<p>To examine constitutive and MeJA-induced resistance against the pine weevil and the blue-stain fungus, a semi-field experiment was set up. On May 21st, 2014 plants were planted on a 1-year-old clear-cut situated in a forest dominated by Scots pine (
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic>), located near Uppsala, Sweden. The plants were randomly assigned to positions in rows with a spacing of 0.1 m between the plants in the same row, and 0.1 m between the rows. Planting was done all in 1 day and plants were planted with their entire soil plug in the clear-cut (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> for the soil plug). Planting was done using a standard cylindrical planting tube (Pottiputki, Finland, 75 mm). To minimize planting stress, we kept soil plugs in a bucket with water before planting them. Once the planting hole was made with the planting tube, we poured water into the hole to moisten the soil and minimize the risk of drought stress. Plants in all treatments and enclosures were treated the same way.
