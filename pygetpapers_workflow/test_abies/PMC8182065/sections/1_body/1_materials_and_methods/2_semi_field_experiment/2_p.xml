<p>Plants intended for exposure to pine weevils were planted separately from plants intended for fungal inoculations. In the same clear-cut, four enclosures (see description below) were built for the pine weevil experiment, enclosing 127, 130, 130, and 130 plants each, and one enclosure with two sub-plots for the 250 plants included in the fungal inoculation experiment. All MeJA treatment Ã— clone combinations were represented in each enclosure, but replicate numbers for each combination varied across enclosures. However, the plants from the 50 mM treatment of clone 1 were never included in the experiment due to MeJA-treatment-related damage, i.e., needles turning brown before the start of the field experiment. Plant height, basal stem diameter and top shoot length were measured for each plant before the start of the experiments.</p>
