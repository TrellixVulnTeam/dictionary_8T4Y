<p>To investigate resistance to pine weevil damage, weevils were released in the enclosures containing the group of plants intended for this purpose. Approximately 300 pine weevils were released on July 1st, 2014 in each of the four enclosures (48 days after the second MeJA treatment occurred). The enclosures were about 0.2 m high, and prevented pine weevils from escaping and reaching the experimental plants intended for fungal inoculations. Each enclosure consisted of a wooden framework placed around each group of plants (but open across the top). The inner edges of the wooden enclosure were covered with a plastic film, and this plastic film was painted with polytetrafluoroethylene (Fluon
 <sup>®</sup>, Blades Biological Ltd., Cowden Edenbridge, Kent, United Kingdom). This created a slippery surface preventing the weevils from climbing over the enclosure. The pine weevils that were released into these enclosures had been collected at the same clear-cut earlier in the spring, and kept in rearing boxes with access to food (freshly-cut conifer branches) and water until the start of the experiment. After release, damage inflicted by pine weevils on each plant was measured as the stem area debarked (cm
 <sup>2</sup>), and was recorded during July 23rd–24th, 2014. Area debarked was measured as the sum of the areas of each wound inflicted by the pine weevil. A template with different area sizes illustrated on millimeter paper, was used for calculating the area of each wound. Only the area, and not the depth of the wound, was measured. Enclosures were included as blocks in the statistical analyses.
