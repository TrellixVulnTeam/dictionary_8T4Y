<p>To investigate resistance against the blue-stain fungus, plants in the different MeJA treatments (0, 25 or 50 mM) were further assigned to two treatments: fungal or no fungal inoculation (control) group. On July 1st and 2nd, 2014 (48-49 days after the second MeJA treatment occurred) the lower part of the stem of plants in the fungal inoculation group was inoculated with 
 <italic>E. polonica</italic>. Using a 4 mm cork borer, a phloem plug (about 1.5-2.0 mm in depth) was removed from each plant and an agar plug with 
 <italic>E. polonica</italic> inoculum was in turn introduced. For plants in the control group, an agar plug not containing 
 <italic>E. polonica</italic> was introduced instead. The 
 <italic>E. polonica</italic> inoculum or the non-infected agar plug was fixed to the stem with Parafilm®. On August 29th, 2014 plants were harvested for analyses, i.e., about 8 weeks after the inoculation. The blue-stain fungus experiment was ended at a later date than the pine weevil experiment, given that the insect feeds at a faster pace than fungal lesions occur. Lesion lengths of 
 <italic>E. polonica</italic> in the phloem were assessed by removing the outer bark upward from the inoculation point. A surgical knife was used for the removal of the bark and the length of the lesions was measured using a ruler. Only for plants in the 0 and 50 mM MeJA treatments, we cut the plants into parts and kept only ten centimeters of the entire stem (which included the inoculated area), and froze these stem pieces in an −80°C freezer until chemical analyses were conducted.
