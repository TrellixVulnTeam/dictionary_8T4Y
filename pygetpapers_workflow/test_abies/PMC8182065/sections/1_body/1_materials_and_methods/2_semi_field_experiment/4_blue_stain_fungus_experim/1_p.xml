<p>The strain of the blue stain fungus 
 <italic>E. polonica</italic>, which was used for inoculations, was NFLI 1993–208/115. It was obtained from the culture collection of the Norwegian Institute for Bioeconomy Research in Ås, Norway. The strain was isolated from a Norway spruce log inoculated with the bark beetle 
 <italic>Polygraphus poligraphus</italic> L. (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Krokene and Solheim, 1996</xref>). This 
 <italic>E. polonica</italic> isolate has been used in many of our previous studies (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Axelsson et al., 2020</xref>), it grows well on Norway spruce and has shown consistent virulence across our studies. The fungal strain was maintained on malt agar (2% malt, 1.5% agar) at 4°C, and transferred to fresh malt agar and cultivated at 25°C in darkness for 7-10 days, before the start of the experiment.
