<p>Treatment with MeJA enhanced Norway spruce resistance to insect and fungal damage when clones were separately exposed to these two pests. On average, plants treated with 50 mM MeJA received 76% less 
 <italic>H. abietis</italic> damage and experienced 55% shorter 
 <italic>E. polonica</italic> lesion lengths relative to untreated control plants. Clones receiving 25 mM MeJA also experienced similar reductions (78% less pine weevil damage and 56% shorter lesion lengths compared to controls). Our results are in line with previous studies on MeJA-induced resistance in 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> and other conifers species. Decreases in pine weevil damage ranging from 50 to 70%, for example, have been shown to occur after consecutive treatment with 10 mM MeJA in Norway spruce seedlings (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen Y. et al., 2020</xref>). For other species such as 
 <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic>, pine weevil damage was reduced by 80% after treatment with 100 mM MeJA (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Moreira et al., 2009</xref>), and reduced by 30â€“60% for 
 <italic>P. pinaster</italic>, 
 <italic>P. radiata</italic>, 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> seedlings treated with 25 mM MeJA (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Zas et al., 2014</xref>). MeJA can change the pattern of pine weevil feeding, with weevils inflicting fewer and smaller scars on induced seedlings (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Fedderwitz et al., 2016</xref>), and resulting in less damage overall. Similarly, treatment with 10 mM MeJA has also been shown to reduce feeding by the bark-feeding beetle 
 <italic>Monochamus alternatus</italic> in 
 <italic>Pinus massoniana</italic> roughly by half compared to non-treated plants (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen R. et al., 2020</xref>). For 
 <italic>E. polonica</italic>, Norway spruce seedlings treated with 100 mM MeJA have been reported to experience 51% shorter lesion lengths than control plants (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Krokene et al., 2008</xref>). Even mature trees treated with 50 mM MeJA have shown decreased blue-staining of the sapwood (caused by 
 <italic>E. polonica</italic> infection) compared to non-treated trees (15% vs. 70% staining, respectively; 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Zeneli et al., 2006</xref>). Plant resistance to other pathogens, such as 
 <italic>Sphaeropsis sapinea</italic> and 
 <italic>Pythium ultimum</italic> in 
 <italic>P. radiata</italic> and 
 <italic>P. abies</italic>, respectively, has also been shown to be enhanced by exogenous application of MeJA (
