<p>Lastly, but most interestingly, we also found that damage by 
 <italic>H. abietis</italic> negatively correlated with fungal infection by 
 <italic>E. polonica</italic> both when treated with 0 and 50 mM MeJA. Clones that were constitutively more resistant to 
 <italic>H. abietis</italic>, exhibited lower resistance against 
 <italic>E. polonica</italic> and vice versa when clones were separately exposed to these two pests. Likewise, those genotypes showing a high degree of MeJA-inducibility for insect damage (greatest change in area debarked from 0 to 50 mM MeJA) showed little change in fungal infection when induced. Thus, there is a trade-off between resistance to 
 <italic>E. polonica</italic> and 
 <italic>H. abietis</italic>. Few studies have examined the relationship between resistance to both insect and fungal pests in conifers, and using the same clones. To our knowledge, this is the first time a trade-off between pine weevil damage and a fungal infection has been reported. Relationships among different fungal pathogens are more often studied, and in these studies resistance or susceptibility to fungal infection have been shown to correlate positively or negatively with each other (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bonello et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Hurel et al., 2019</xref>). For instance, infection by 
 <italic>Heterobasidion annosum</italic> in the basal stem of 
 <italic>Pinus pinea</italic> reduced the concentration of total terpenoids in the shoots in response to 
 <italic>Diplodia pinea</italic> inoculation relative to those found in healthy shoots (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bonello et al., 2008</xref>). Lower concentrations of terpenes were found in shoots more susceptible to 
 <italic>D. pinea</italic> (i.e., those with greater lesion sizes), indicating that higher resistance to 
 <italic>H. annosum</italic> came at the cost of resistance to 
 <italic>D. pinea</italic> (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bonello et al., 2008</xref>). In our study, MeJA treatment increased resistance to both insect and fungal damage, thus it is less likely that a negative correlation among resistances is due to different defense pathways being involved. Also, as described above, many of the terpene compounds that reduce fungal infection have also been shown to play a role in deterring insect feeding (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Lundborg et al., 2016b</xref>). Note, however, that we evaluated resistance to each pest separately in clonal individuals (i.e., infection and pine weevil damage did not co-occur). It is possible that the clones examined differed in other unmeasured traits (morphological, physiological or chemical), which confer high constitutive resistance to insect or fungal damage. We are currently unable to discern underlying mechanisms behind this trade-off, but it certainly deserves further attention.
