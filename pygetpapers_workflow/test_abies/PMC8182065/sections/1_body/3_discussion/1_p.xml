<p>Our study showed that treatment with the plant hormone methyl jasmonate (MeJA) increased the resistance of Norway spruce (
 <italic>P. abies</italic>) clones that were separately exposed to pine weevil (
 <italic>H. abietis</italic>) damage and blue-stain fungus (
 <italic>E. polonica</italic>) infection. Treatment with MeJA also changed the terpene chemistry of plants relative to those that were untreated, however, most of the variation in chemistry was explained by differences between Norway spruce clones. Most interestingly, we found that resistance against the pine weevil and blue-stain fungus exhibited a trade-off when comparing the estimates of area debarked and lesion lengths for each clone. Clones that received little pine weevil damage exhibited larger fungal lesion lengths, and vice versa, both constitutively and when treated with MeJA. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such a trade-off.
