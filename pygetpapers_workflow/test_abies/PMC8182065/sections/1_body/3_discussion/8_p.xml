<p>Even though pine weevil damage and infection by 
 <italic>E. polonica</italic> do not co-occur naturally, a negative correlation among resistance to each of these pests could potentially constrain the availability of suitable Norway spruce genotypes for tree breeding programs. Current breeding programs in Sweden and other Nordic countries are interested in identifying clones or families with resistance to pine weevil damage, but also resistance to attack by the spruce bark beetle and infection by 
 <italic>E. polonica</italic> (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Steffenrem et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Zas et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Puentes et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Axelsson et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, the negative correlation documented in our study does not necessarily pose a hinder for selection of such families. Clones that are constitutively more resistant to 
 <italic>E. polonica</italic> should show high MeJA-induced resistance to 
 <italic>H. abie</italic>tis damage and vice versa. In other words, Norway spruce clones that are constitutively more resistant to one of the pests, should show greater induced resistance against the other. One alternative could be the selection of clones/families that exhibit high MeJA-mediated resistance against pine weevil damage and are constitutively more resistant to fungal infection. Protection against pine weevil damage is necessary for only a few years after planting, since pine weevils cause high mortality only at the seedling stage. In terms of applicability, several studies have shown that treating seedlings with MeJA can be compatible with nursery practices (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Fedderwitz et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen Y. et al., 2020</xref>). Infection by 
 <italic>E. polonica</italic> occurs when mature trees are attacked by the spruce bark beetle, and it would be important for these trees to be constitutively more resistant to infection. Note that we have identified this negative correlation among resistances at an early plant stage, in separate clonal individuals and with a limited number of clones. This relationship could, thus, be different for mature Norway spruce trees that were damaged early in life by pine weevils and later become infected by 
 <italic>E. polonica</italic>. Nonetheless, if breeding for increased resistance is of interest, this trade-off should be taken into consideration.
