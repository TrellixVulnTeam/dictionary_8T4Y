<p>So far, we have discussed our results assuming that MeJA acts as an elicitor that results in defense induction, which has been supported by previous studies (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Hudgins et al., 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Krokene et al., 2008</xref>). It is important to note that recently, MeJA was also found to be able to act as a priming stimulus and need not always result in full direct induction of defenses. Mature Norway spruce trees treated with MeJA did not show any change in terpene levels 14 days after treatment, yet they experienced increased resistance to spruce bark beetle attack relative to untreated controls, 65 days after treatment (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Mageroy et al.,2020a,b</xref>). In our study, we observed both changes in terpene chemistry and enhanced resistance following MeJA treatment. Treatment occurred in April/May and plants were exposed to the insects/fungus in July, while samples for chemical analyses were taken in August. The effects of MeJA on terpenes and resistance can change with time, but can still be observed at 1 month and even 1 year after treatment (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Zas et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, our experimental timings are in line with when effects can be detected. However, since our study design was not intended for discerning the underlying mechanisms of MeJA treatment, we are unable to say whether priming or direct induction of defenses occurred.
