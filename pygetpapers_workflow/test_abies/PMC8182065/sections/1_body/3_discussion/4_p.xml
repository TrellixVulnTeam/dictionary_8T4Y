<p>In addition to the effects of MeJA treatment on overall resistance, its effect on terpene chemistry was also investigated. Plants treated with MeJA exhibited an increase in the amounts of terpenes such as α-pinene, β-pinene, limonene, β-phellandrene, camphene, calarene, myrcene and even (+)-3-carene. Terpene accumulation following MeJA treatment has been previously described to occur in Norway spruce (

 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Lundborg et al. (2016b)</xref> found that α-pinene and limonene respond strongly to treatment with MeJA in Norway spruce. Similarly, myrcene and β-pinene have been shown to increase after treatment with MeJA in mature Jack pine trees (
