<p>Despite the significant effect of MeJA on terpene compounds, treatment explained little variation in plant defensive chemistry relative to clone (2% vs. 42%, respectively, 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Norway spruce clones responded in a similar way to MeJA treatment (non-significant MeJA × clone interaction, 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), however, differences among clones were most important for determining terpene composition. This in contrast to the study by 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">López-Goldar et al. (2018)</xref> where MeJA treatment explained 31% of the variation in defensive compounds, while family explained 2%, in 
 <italic>P. pinaster</italic>. Yet, it is in line with other studies in which variation in defensive chemistry has been to a large extent explained by among family (or genotype/clone) differences (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Havill and Raffa, 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Ott et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Axelsson et al., 2020</xref>). Our results from terpene chemistry analyses are consistent with our results on insect damage and fungal lesion lengths, for which we also found that differences among clones had a strong effect on the response variables (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All in all, if MeJA is to be implemented as a plant protection tool, these findings reiterate firstly the importance of quantifying among-clone (or family) variation in defensive responses. And secondly, evaluating the relative importance of constitutive and MeJA-induced responses among clones, and the relationship with actual resistance (i.e., change in damage or infection levels).
