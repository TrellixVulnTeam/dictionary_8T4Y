<p>Even though overall plant resistance was improved, we found that MeJA-mediated changes in resistance occurred to a greater or lesser extent depending on the Norway spruce clone examined. Some clones exhibited high levels of resistance (i.e., received less insect damage or fungal infection) constitutively (0 mM MeJA), and for these clones, MeJA treatment did not result in a large change in area debarked or lesion length (flatter reaction norms from 0 to 50 mM MeJA in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Likewise, clones that were less resistant (i.e., received greater insect damage or fungal infection) constitutively, experienced large reductions in pine weevil feeding and shorter fungal lesions (i.e., became more resistant) when treated with MeJA (steeper reaction norms in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, not all clones responded equally to MeJA treatment and their degree of MeJA-mediated inducibility differed. In line with these findings, other studies have also found that conifer clones, genotypes, families, provenances, and even different species can vary in their responses to MeJA (

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Howe et al., 2020</xref>) found that inverse relationships between constitutive and inducible levels of defense (i.e., individuals with high constitutive defense do not show large changes when induced) against bark beetle damage are often detected at the genotype/family level in common gardens, yet these relationships do not hold at the forest population level. Thus, the scale at which genetic correlations are examined is relevant for their detection and implications. If MeJA is to be implemented as a tool in plant protection, it is important that this variability among individuals or genotypes is considered and quantified. For example, screening for variation in the degree of inducibility in material from tree breeding populations or from various provenances, should be conducted.
