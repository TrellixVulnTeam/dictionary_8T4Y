<p>We conclude that MeJA treatment can change Norway spruce terpene chemistry, and increase resistance to insect damage by 
 <italic>H. abietis</italic> and fungal infection by 
 <italic>E. polonica</italic>. However, for Norway spruce genotypes that are constitutively more resistant to insect damage or fungal infection, treatment with MeJA may not result in larger additional changes in resistance. Differences among clones appear to be most important for changes in defensive chemistry and degree of MeJA-mediated responses. Interestingly, we also found a trade-off between resistance to insect and fungal damage when examining estimates per clone, but this does not necessarily entail negative consequences for overall plant defense or hinder selection of the most resistant trees. Norway spruce clones that are constitutively more resistant to one of the pests, should show greater induced resistance against the other. Thus, treatment with MeJA should result in enhanced resistance to one of the pests, without compromising resistance to the other. Future studies should quantify the relative importance of constitutive vs. induced responses to various types of pests, and examine the generality of negative correlations among resistances in a larger number of clones, as well as in other conifer species.
