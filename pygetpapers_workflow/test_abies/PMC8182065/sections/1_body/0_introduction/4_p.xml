<p>From a plant protection perspective, exogenous application of phytohormones such as jasmonic acid and its methyl ester (methyl jasmonate) has been proposed as a tool to prime or induce defenses associated with conifer resistance to insects and fungal pests (

 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Moreira et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">López-Goldar et al., 2018</xref>), with some genotypes showing greater or lesser levels of inducibility relative to their constitutive state. Therefore, to tackle challenges posed by multiple pests it is not only of interest to identify trade-offs in defense, but also those genotypes that respond strongly to elicitors such as MeJA and effectively increase their resistance. This knowledge allows us to better predict and understand the outcome of conifer interactions with various pests, and implement long-lasting and sustainable plant protection strategies.
