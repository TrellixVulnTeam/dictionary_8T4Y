<p>To answer these questions, we used a clonal set-up where we compared chemical defenses (terpenes) and resistance of MeJA-induced and non-induced plants of the same Norway spruce clones. Resistance to the insect and fungus pests were investigated separately (in different individuals of the same clones) in a semi-field experiment. We quantified stem area debarked by the pine weevil and fungal growth (lesion length) as measures of plant resistance, with resistant plants being those receiving little to no insect damage or shorter lesion lengths. We quantified terpene chemistry as a measure of defense, and refer to it as defense or defensive chemistry throughout. The use of clones facilitates correlations among resistances to be estimated, and to tease apart the relative importance of constitutive and induced resistance against each attacker.</p>
