<p>The extent of effective resistance against coniferous pests, achieved through constitutive and/or induced resistance, has been largely examined separately for most pest organisms without consideration on how they affect each other. Resistant individuals are those that can stop or deter attackers, and thus effectively reduce their damage or infection levels relative to susceptible individuals. In particular, little is known about the relationship between resistance to insects and fungal pathogens that are not mutually associated (i.e., those that do not co-occur and depend on each other for host colonization), and if the relative importance of defense components varies or shifts with respect to each pest species (

Given that effective resistance against fungal and insect pests may or may not involve different defense pathways (e.g., jasmonic acid or salicylic acid signaling pathways), the consequences of responses induced by these pests can be antagonistic or complementary to each other (
