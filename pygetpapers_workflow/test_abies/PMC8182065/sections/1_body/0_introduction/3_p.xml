<p>The presence or absence of trade-offs among defense components against specific pests, and the consequences for effective resistance, can vary depending on plant genotype or species in question (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Koricheva et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Erb et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Moreira et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Hahn and Maron, 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Shikano et al., 2017</xref>). For instance, not all genotypes respond equally to attack by the same pest in conifers, as they can vary, e.g., in their allocation to constitutive and induced defense (e.g.,

 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Sampedro et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Villari et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Moreira et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Pimentel et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Reglinski et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, the relative importance of constitutive and induced defense is also dependent on whether the species examined is fast- or slow-growing, or its degree of competitive ability (

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Kempel et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Moreira et al., 2014</xref>). Differences in allocation to defense strategies can result in trade-offs among constitutive and induced resistance (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Rasmann et al., 2011</xref>). Depending on which strategy is most important for deterring the attacker in question, this could in turn result in negative correlations among resistances to each pest. Understanding such variation in resistance trade-offs is especially important for conifer breeding programs and novel plant protection tools aimed at enhancing intrinsic tree defenses. Without knowledge of such correlations, breeding may select for genotypes that exhibit opposing susceptibility to, e.g., fungal and insect pests. Thus, uncovering genetic relationships among defenses is crucial to producing improved tree material that can effectively resist various pests (
