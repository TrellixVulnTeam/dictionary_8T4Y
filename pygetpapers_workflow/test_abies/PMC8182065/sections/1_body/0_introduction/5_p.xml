<p>In this study, we conducted an experiment to examine genotypic variation in defense inducibility, in terms of terpene chemistry, and the importance of induction for insect and fungal pathogen resistance in Norway spruce (
 <italic>Picea abies</italic>). We examined variation between clones in MeJA-induced responses, and to damage by the pine weevil (
 <italic>H. abietis</italic>) and a virulent blue-stain fungus (
 <italic>E. polonica</italic>) associated with the spruce bark beetle. The pine weevil represents the main threat to newly planted conifer plants in Europe (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Långström and Day, 2004</xref>) as it can feed on the phloem and bark of seedlings, causing stem girdling and high mortality rates. The necrotrophic blue-stain fungus 
 <italic>E. polonica</italic> plays a key role in mediating tree death following spruce bark beetle attacks, which are a major threat to mature Norway spruce in Europe (

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Hlásny et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the pine weevil and blue-stain fungus pose large threats to tree survival but at different developmental stages. Resistance to these economically-important threats has been examined separately, and the relationship among resistance to insect damage and fungal infection is not known. Being resistant to the pine weevil early in life, for example, could come at the cost of being susceptible to fungal infection later in life and vice versa. Such trade-offs are important from an ecological perspective, but also from a plant breeding perspective as there are ongoing efforts to produce genetically improved tree material that is resistant to various pests. Here, we aimed to investigate the correlation among constitutive and induced resistance to an herbivorous insect and a pathogenic fungus. More specifically, we aimed to answer:
