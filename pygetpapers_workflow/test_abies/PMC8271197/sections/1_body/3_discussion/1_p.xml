<p>Drought stress typically induces short-term physiological and molecular responses that enable plants to survive periods of limited or fluctuating water availability. In roots, these responses are initiated by the limitation of soil water uptake, with root-level responses to this initial limitation being an important component in determining the whole-plant drought tolerance and survival. Despite the importance of root responses, most previous studies have focused on the response of aboveground tissues. In this study, drought-induced transcriptional changes of both roots and needles of Norway spruce seedlings were assayed by subjecting seedlings to a progressively increasing soil water deficit, followed by a recovery phase after re-irrigation. The induced transcriptional responses were placed within a framework of physiological responses observed in needles (

To explore the extent of conservation in the transcriptional drought response and to determine the appropriateness of utilizing functional annotations derived from other species, the transcriptional response of Norway spruce was compared with previous results in Arabidopsis as the most comprehensively studied model system for drought and other abiotic stress responses and the primary source of gene functional annotation.
