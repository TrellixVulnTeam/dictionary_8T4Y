<p>Comparison of transcriptional regulation between species is important to determine the evolution of stress responses and to ascertain the applicability of transferring biological knowledge (i.e., functional annotation descriptions) and selection of targets across species. While a number of studies have examined transcriptome responses to drought in conifer species (

Here, indications of both conservation and divergence in transcriptional responses were observed between Arabidopsis and Norway spruce. The conserved component of the Norway spruce response included up-regulation of solute accumulation, ROS scavenging, ABA biosynthesis and signaling, with many genes involved in these processes highly ranked within NMs. In contrast, proline catabolism, ROS production and auxin and cytokinin signaling responses were limited. However, a large proportion of the homologs or orthologs of the characterized Arabidopsis drought-responsive genes considered were not DE in response to drought, suggesting that there are extensive differences as to which genes regulate the induced, common components of the conserved stress response transcriptional program between the two species. For this subset of genes in particular, functional descriptions derived in Arabidopsis potentially do not reflect function in Norway spruce, highlighting the need for species- or lineage-specific functional characterization. Determining whether these diverged transcriptional responses reflect the differences between lineages or is a specific component of the contrasting isohydric versus anisohydric drought-response strategies also requires further studies. In addition to this set of sequence-conserved genes, there were several Norway spruce-specific genes actively regulated in response to drought as has been reported by previous studies of drought stress in a range of conifer species (

 <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">de María et al. 2020</xref>). These genes lack functional annotation based on homology and were fully integrated within the co-expression network, making them interesting targets for future characterization studies.
