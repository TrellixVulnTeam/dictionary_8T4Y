<p>The observed drought-response mechanism highlights the potential for Norway spruce seedlings to experience severe negative effects when exposed to relatively short periods of soil drying. Given the combination of a typically shallow root system and the expected increase in both the frequency and severity of such drought events, there could be substantial ecological and economic implications. This sensitivity to drought is especially relevant to the context of Norway spruce forestry and planting after clear-cut. As a late successional species, Norway spruce is increasingly likely to have maladapted abiotic stress mechanisms when grown in a clear-cut context where conditions are considerably different from those where the Norway spruce seedlings would typically establish. This study provides a comprehensive characterization of the transcriptional drought-response mechanisms in Norway spruce roots and needles, highlighting the substantial difference in the transcriptional response to drought between the two tissues. The extensive down-regulation of genes related to the growth and metabolism in roots would result in a large impact on the seedling growth, establishment and biomass accumulation. There are also associated potential implications that we do not explore in the current study, such as the effects of alternations to microbial community interactions as a result of altered root growth. In contrast to roots, little transcriptional response was observed in needles, reflecting the limited physiological changes in water potential and stomatal conductance shown until severe drought was experienced. Combined with reduced root growth, these effects could have substantial ecological impacts and economic implications, including the effects on carbon sequestration.</p>
