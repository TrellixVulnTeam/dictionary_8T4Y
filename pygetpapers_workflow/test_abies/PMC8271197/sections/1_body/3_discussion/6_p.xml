<p>While many genes differed in their response to drought between Arabidopsis, several genes with known functional roles in drought tolerance were DE and showed a transcriptional response in needles and roots, suggesting conserved function and making these robust targets for either breeding and selection or genome engineering. The observed drought response involved expression-conserved up-regulation of solute synthesis, such as of malate (

 <italic toggle="yes">ANAC072</italic>/
 <italic toggle="yes">RD26</italic>, which were here up-regulated in needles and roots, have been shown to improve drought stress tolerance in Arabidopsis when overexpressed (
 <xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">Nakashima et al. 2012</xref>). The 
 <italic toggle="yes">ANAC019</italic> and 
 <italic toggle="yes">ANAC072/RD26</italic> genes, here with root-specific expression, have been classified as stress-responsive NAC (SNAC) TFs (
 <xref rid="ref89" ref-type="bibr">Tran et al. 2004</xref>). Expression changes of many MYB TFs have been reported during drought stress responses in plants (
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Baldoni et al. 2015</xref>), including in conifer species (

 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Du et al. 2018</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">de María et al. 2020</xref>), although their functional role has not been elucidated. 
 <italic toggle="yes">MYB2</italic> is known to mediate response to abiotic stress and regulate gene expression of ABA-inducible genes (
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Abe et al. 2003</xref>) and to be expressed in both the shoots and roots of Arabidopsis and rice (
 <xref rid="ref96" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al. 2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Baldoni et al. 2015</xref>). This gene was DE early on in roots in the current study, suggesting functional conservation, indicating early activation of ABA-induced response mechanisms despite the non-significant increase in ABA levels. Severe drought stress induced 
 <italic toggle="yes">MYB96</italic> in roots, which may function to arrest lateral root growth in a similar manner to the described role in Arabidopsis (
 <xref rid="ref80" ref-type="bibr">Seo et al. 2009</xref>). This response is suggested to enable maximal resource allocation to primary root growth to facilitate rapid recovery after cessation of water shortage (
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Comas et al. 2013</xref>). During recovery, 
 <italic toggle="yes">MYB15</italic> was here expressed in roots and, in Arabidopsis, this gene has been reported as a negative regulator of 
 <italic toggle="yes">DREB1/CBF</italic> genes during cold stress (
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Agarwal et al. 2006</xref>). Potentially, this gene may therefore have a similar function in Norway spruce prior to and during recovery.
