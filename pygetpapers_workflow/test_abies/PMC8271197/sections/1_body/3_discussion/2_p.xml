 <italic toggle="yes">Picea rubens</italic> Sarg.) photosynthesis continued until water potential decreased to −3.0 MPa and was rapidly recovered to 70% of well-watered plants after re-irrigation (
 <xref rid="ref79" ref-type="bibr">Seiler and Cazell 1990</xref>). In the current experiment, re-irrigation after 21 days resulted in 80% recovery of the photosynthetic rates (
 <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). Nevertheless, the treatment was regarded as severe, with death occurring in a set of seedlings that experienced an additional 2 days of severe drought (indicated by an X symbol in 
 <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). In agreement with this observation, it was reported earlier that Norway spruce seedlings die after crossing a critical point of dehydration (
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Ditmarova et al. 2010</xref>) and that drought results in the mortality of Norway spruce seedlings (
 <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Ivanov et al. 2019</xref>). These findings highlight the severe negative effects that could result from the changing patterns of soil water availability as a result of continued climate change.
