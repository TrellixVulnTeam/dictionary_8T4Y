<p>A single co-expression network was inferred for the needle and root data using the per gene vst-normalized expression values. Genes with low variance were removed by calculating the median absolute deviation (MAD) and by excluding all genes with MAD = 0. Eleven network inference methods were computed for each dataset using the Seidr v0.12 toolkit (

In case of non-symmetrical scoring by the method, the higher score for every symmetric edge pair was kept. The networks were aggregated using the inverse rank product method (
