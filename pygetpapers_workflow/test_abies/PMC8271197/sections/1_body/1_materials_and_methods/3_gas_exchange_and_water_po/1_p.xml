<p>Gas exchange measurements were performed with a portable infrared gas analyser (model LI-6400XT; Licor, Lincoln, NE, USA) at Days 0, 2, 4, 5, 13, 16, 17, 18 and 25 of the drought treatment. Leaf photosynthesis at light saturation (

 <sub>s</sub> were measured between 10:00 and 15:00h on three control and three drought-treated plants not used for RNA-Seq in a randomized sequence. Photosynthetic photon flux density inside the cuvette was maintained at 1500 μmol m

 <sup>−1</sup> and CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration was maintained at 400 μmol mol
 <sup>−1</sup>. Furthermore, leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit was between 1 and 1.5 kPa, leaf temperature was close to 22 °C and humidity in the cuvette was maintained above 60%. Photosynthetic leaf area of the shoots used for gas exchange measurements was determined using ImageJ (

 <sub>shoot</sub>) was measured at midday on three lateral shoots from each of three to five plants on Days 0, 2, 4, 5, 13, 18, 21 and 25 of the treatment. The cut shoots were sealed in a plastic bag and stored in an insulated container until measurement with a Scholander-type pressure chamber (SKPM 1400, Skye instruments Ltd, Powys, UK).
