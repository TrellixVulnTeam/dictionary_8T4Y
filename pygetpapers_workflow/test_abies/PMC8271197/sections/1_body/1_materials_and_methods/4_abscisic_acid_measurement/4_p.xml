<p>Abscisic acid was analysed using a 1290 Infinity system from Agilent Technologies (Waldbronn, Germany) coupled to an Agilent Technologies 6495 triple quadrupolequadruple tandem mass spectrometer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a jet stream electrospray ion source operated in the negative mode. Twenty microliter of each sample was injected onto an Acquity UPLC® HSST3 1.8 μm, 2.1 × 50 mm column (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) held at 40 °C in a column oven. The gradient eluents used were 0.1% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (B), with a flow rate of 500 μl min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The initial conditions consisted of 0.1% B, hold between 0 and 2 min, linear increments between 0 and 2 min to 10% B, 2 and 7 min to 99% B and hold between 9 and 9.30 min at 99% B. Thereafter, the column was re-equilibrated back to 0.1% B.
