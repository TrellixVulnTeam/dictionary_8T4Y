<p>For sample extraction, ~50 mg of each ground root and needle sample used for RNA extraction was placed into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes together with 1 ml of ice-cold extraction medium (methanol/water/acetic acid, 80:19:1), including 2 ng of [
 <sup>2</sup>H
 <sub>6</sub>]-ABA (Olchemim Ltd, Olomouc, Czech Republic) as an internal standard. The samples were extracted in a mixer mill (Retsch GmbH and Co. KG, Haan, Germany) at 30 Hz for 3 min, including a 3-mm tungsten carbide bead in the tube. The bead was removed, and after centrifugation (10 min, 14,000 rpm, 4 °C), the supernatants were transferred into clean test tubes. The extraction solvent was evaporated using a SpeedVac concentrator for 1.5 h (Savant Instrument, Farming dale, NY, USA) until approximately 100 μl of solvent was left. After evaporation, 5 μl of 1 M HCl was added prior to solid-phase extraction (SPE) analysis.
