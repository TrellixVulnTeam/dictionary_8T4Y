<p>The mass spectrometry was performed under the conditions of 150 °C gas temperature, gas flow at 12 l min
 <sup>−1</sup>, nebulizer 35 psi, sheath gas temperature 400 °C, sheath gas flow 12 l min
 <sup>−1</sup>, capillary voltage at 3500 V and collision energy at 11 V. The instrument was running in multiple reactions monitoring mode (MRM) with a dwell time of 200 ms for each MRM transition. The following MRM transitions were recorded: ABA 263 → 219, 263 → 201, 263 → 153; [
