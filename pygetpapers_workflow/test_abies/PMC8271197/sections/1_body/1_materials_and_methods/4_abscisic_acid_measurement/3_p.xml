<p>Prior to the Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography tandem Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS) analysis, the samples were resuspended in 50 μl of 40% methanol and transferred to LC–MS vials. A six-point calibration curve was prepared from 0.025 to 4 ng/μl, including 2 ng/μl of [
 <sup>2</sup>H
 <sub>6</sub>]-ABA in all calibration levels.
