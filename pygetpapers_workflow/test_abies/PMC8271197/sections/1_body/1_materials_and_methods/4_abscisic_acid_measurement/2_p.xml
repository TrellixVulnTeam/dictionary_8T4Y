<p>For SPE, purification of the samples was performed using a Biotage Pressure +48 manifold (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden). All samples were purified using a reverse-phased C8 column (Isolute®C8 (EC), 100 mg/3 ml Biotage). The SPE sorbent was activated and equilibrated using 1 ml of 10% methanol. The samples were washed with 1 ml of 10% methanol, and thereafter, ABA was eluted with 2 ml of 80% methanol containing 1% acetic acid. After SPE, the solvent was evaporated using a SpeedVac concentrator and stored at −20 °C until further analysis.</p>
