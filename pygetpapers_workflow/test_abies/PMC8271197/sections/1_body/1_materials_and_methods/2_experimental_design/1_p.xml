<p>Three-year-old Norway spruce seedlings of the seed provenance Lilla Istad (56° 30′ N) were grown in a growth room at 18 h light (120 μmol m
 <sup>−2</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup> at plant height) and 20 °C in 3-l pots filled with peat. For a controlled drought treatment, the field capacity (FC) of the soil was determined as the difference in the weight of wet soil and dry weight after oven-drying at 70 °C. Seedlings of the control treatment were kept well watered and monitored gravimetrically to maintain the soil moisture at 80% FC. For a mild drought treatment, water was withheld from the seedlings until soil moisture reduced to 30% FC, 5 days after the initiation of the experiment. Seedlings were kept in this stage of mild drought stress for 7 days by adding the daily evapotranspirational water loss. This was a non-lethal drought stress and above a point where leaf death occurred. A severe drought stress was then imposed by completely withholding water until symptoms of severe dysfunction, as measured by photosynthetic assimilation rates, were observed. At this moment, the severe drought stress was extended for 3 days, bringing plants closer to catastrophic hydraulic failure, before re-irrigation was started. After 4 days of re-watering, soil moisture had returned to the initial well-watered conditions at 80% FC. Needles and fine and small lateral roots (&lt;4 mm) of three to four seedlings were sampled at control (Day 0), mild (2, 4, 5 and 13 days) and severe (18 and 21 days) drought and after re-irrigation (25 days) for RNA-Seq analysis. A set of plants that were not re-irrigated exhibited needle death after one additional Day of the severe drought stress (indicated by an X in 
 <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>), highlighting the severity of the stress and that the seedlings were close to catastrophic hydraulic failure when sampled.
