<p>Roots have an essential role in determining water uptake from the environment and are the first to sense soil water deficit. Norway spruce is often found to have a shallow root system (
 <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Kalliokoski 2011</xref>), with the majority of fine roots located in the upper soil layers (
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Børja et al. 2008</xref>). As such, Norway spruce, and especially seedlings, are highly sensitive to summers with lower precipitation and high evapotranspiration, which will become more prevalent as a result of climate change. The role of ABA production in roots and transport to the foliage to actively reduce guard cell turgor is generally accepted as the primary mechanism mediating stomatal closure during drought stress in herbaceous plants (

 <xref rid="ref69" ref-type="bibr">Roelfsema and Hedrich 2005</xref>). However, in trees, the time required for transport of ABA to the leaves via the vascular tissue exceeds the observed time needed to close stomata (
 <xref rid="ref99" ref-type="bibr">Zimmermann and Brown 1971</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref78" ref-type="bibr">Schulze and Hall 1982</xref>), and evidence suggests that foliar-derived ABA is sufficient to explain stomatal responses in conifers (
 <xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell et al. 2017</xref>). The importance of root-derived ABA is therefore questionable (
 <xref rid="ref92" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson and Davies 2002</xref>), and the relative importance and role of the ABA pools in different plant tissues remains unresolved. The molecular basis of isohydrism has been less studied, but in gymnosperm species, it includes a high sensitivity to ABA (
