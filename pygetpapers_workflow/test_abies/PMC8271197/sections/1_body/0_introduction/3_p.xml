<p>Physiological changes, such as stomatal closure, are the primary cause of drought-induced decreases in productivity. Stomatal closure is stimulated by increasing levels of endogenous ABA during drought stress (
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Iuchi et al. 2001</xref>), which consequently results in reduced availability of CO
 <sub>2</sub> for photosynthesis. Plants differ in their sensitivity to dehydration, with substantial intra- and inter-specific variation in response to drought. Herbaceous and woody ang iosperm species are thought to be mainly anisohydric in that they display a risk-taking behavior, maintaining stomatal conductance (

 <italic toggle="yes">pinophyte</italic>, such as Norway spruce, initiate stomatal closure early during drought and maintain high levels of ABA in the foliage, restricting fast recovery (

Maintenance of an efficient hydraulic system to ensure transport of water from the soil and to reduce water loss from leaves is especially important in trees, which are long-lived, for optimal plant hydration under seasonally and annually fluctuating environmental conditions (

 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Edwards et al. 1998</xref>). Differences in the regulation of water status can determine survival of trees in response to drought, with improper response mechanisms resulting in mortality either from carbon starvation or hydraulic failure in isohydric and anisohydric species, respectively. It is important to understand how species will respond within this continuum of response mechanisms in light of predicted patterns of intensity, duration and frequency of future drought events (
 <xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">McDowell et al. 2008</xref>), which will particularly reduce productivity in ecosystems where the isohydric Pinophyta dominate (
