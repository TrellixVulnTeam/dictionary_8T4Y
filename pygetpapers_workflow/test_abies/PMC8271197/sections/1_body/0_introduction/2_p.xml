<p>Major insights to biochemical and molecular mechanisms important for plant drought response have been gained from studies of herbaceous plants such as Arabidopsis (

In addition, cellular components such as proteins and membranes require stabilization, which involves late embryogenesis-abundant (LEA) proteins, heat shock proteins (HSPs) and dehydrins, together with the above metabolites, which also function as antioxidants (

Transcription factors (TFs) from the ABA responsive element(ABRE)-binding proteins (AREB)/ABRE binding factor (ABF), MYB/MYC, NAC, WRKY and NF-Y families have been shown to regulate ABA-responsive gene expression under drought stress (

In addition, an ABA-independent pathway for signal transduction under drought stress exists, involving the dehydration-responsive element-binding protein (DREB)/C-repeat binding factor (CBF) TFs, a subfamily of APETALA 2 (AP2)/ethylene-responsive element-binding factor (ERF) transcriptional activators (
