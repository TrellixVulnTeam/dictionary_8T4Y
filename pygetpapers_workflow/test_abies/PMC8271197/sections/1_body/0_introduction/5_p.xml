<p>A number of studies have examined the physiological and transcriptional drought responses of various coniferous species (

 <xref rid="ref91" ref-type="bibr">Trujillo-Moya et al. 2018</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">de María et al. 2020</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Klápště et al. 2020</xref>). A common feature of these previous transcriptomics studies was the use of sequence similarity to assign functional descriptions on the basis of the highest sequence similarity homolog. These functional descriptions were nearly exclusively assigned on the basis of work performed using angiosperm species, in particular Arabidopsis. Contemporary studies of drought response in extant species must consider the extensive divergence time of the gymnosperm and angiosperm lineages. Subsequent evolution in both lineages after the split may have resulted in the divergence of both gene regulation and function. As extremely few genes have been functionally characterized in gymnosperm species, caution is needed when using such a sequence similarity-based transfer of functional information.
