<p>This study used RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) to assay the transcriptional response of Norway spruce seedlings experiencing a mild and severe water stress and samples after re-irrigation to determine the extent of expression conservation to typified angiosperm drought-response mechanisms. There was extensive reversible plasticity for physiological responses, including

 <sub>s</sub>, shoot water potential and ABA levels. Needles and roots showed markedly contrasting transcriptome remodulation in response to drought, including differences in plasticity upon re-watering. Additionally, comparison of the transcriptional response with a set of well-characterized Arabidopsis drought-response genes identified regulators with both divergence and conservation at the expression level.
