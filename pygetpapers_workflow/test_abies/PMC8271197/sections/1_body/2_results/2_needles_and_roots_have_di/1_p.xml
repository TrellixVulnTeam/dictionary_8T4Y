<p>Needle and root samples revealed only limited changes in relative transcript abundance in response to the mild drought treatment, while the severe drought induced a more extensive transcriptional response, particularly in roots (

 <xref rid="sup2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref> available as Supplementary data at

 <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b and c</xref>). Similarly, 98 genes were DE in roots, with 90 up-and eight down-regulated genes (
 <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b and c</xref>). Three of the genes DE during the mild drought stress were commonly up-regulated between the tissues (
 <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). In contrast, 1304 genes were DE in response to severe drought stress in needles, with 871 of these up- and 433 down-regulated, while in roots, there were 5835 DEGs, of which 1926 were up- and 3909 down-regulated. Extensive down-regulation was therefore a notable component of the transcriptional response mechanism of roots during severe drought stress, and active remodulation of the transcriptome was far more prominent in roots than in needles; 440 and 129 of the genes DE during the severe drought stress were commonly up- or down-regulated between the tissues, respectively (
 <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). After re-irrigation, 23 genes were DE in needles, 14 up- and 9 down-regulated, whereas in roots, 853 genes were DE, 603 up- and 250 down-regulated (
 <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b and c</xref>). Two of the genes DE during re-irrigation were commonly down-regulated in both tissues, and one gene was commonly up-regulated (
 <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>).
