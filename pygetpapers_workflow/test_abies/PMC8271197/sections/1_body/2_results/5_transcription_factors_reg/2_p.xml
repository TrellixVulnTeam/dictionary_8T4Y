<p>Components of ABA-independent signaling via

 <italic toggle="yes">ERF53</italic> were DE in response to drought in roots (see below). In needles, TF ZF2 was up-regulated in Cluster 2 (
 <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). In Cluster 3 and NM 1:2, both ABA-dependent NAC TFs (NAC3/NAC055, RD26) and ABA-independent ERFs (DREB19, ERF7) were commonly up-regulated in both tissues. In roots, the earliest transcriptional response was up-regulation of the ABA-dependent 
 <italic toggle="yes">MYB2</italic> in Cluster 4 after 5 days, the expression of which remained high under severe water stress (
 <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). Severe drought in roots additionally activated NAC019, TFs within the ERF family (DREB2B, ERF53, RAP2.1, RAP2.4 and RAP2.6 L), a WRKY TF (WRKY33) and MYBs (
 <italic toggle="yes">MYB96</italic>, MYBR1) (
 <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>, Cluster 5). ARR-B TFs (RR10, RR1) and ZFHD1/ZFHD11/HB29 were also up-regulated after severe drought in roots. Down-regulation of TFs in roots after severe drought occurred for ERF family members (CBF1/DREB1B, CBF3/DREB1A, CBF4/DREB1D, HRD, DDF1, RAP2.1 and SHN1/WIN1, 
 <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>, Cluster 10). Also, MYB TFs (MYB61, MYBR1), a BHLH TF (BHLH100) and a HD-ZIP TF (HB6) were down-regulated. After re-irrigation, increased expression of TFs, such as of

 <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>, Clusters 6 and 7). Drought-responsive TFs included several Norway spruce-specific singletons (
