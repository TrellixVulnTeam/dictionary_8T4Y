 <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). Abscisic acid levels were low in both needles and roots throughout the mild drought stress (Days 2, 4, 5 and 13), increased dramatically during the severe drought stress (Days 18 and 21) and returned to control levels after re-irrigation (

A small, transient but non-significant increase in root ABA was observed at Day 5, with levels dropping to control values after water was added to maintain FC at 30%. During the same period, ABA levels in needles showed a small, gradual but non-significant increase. Shoot water potential changed significantly after 5 days of mild water stress (
