<p>To determine whether singletons were fully integrated within the drought-response network, had particular network statistic characteristics or if there were specific transcriptional modules enriched for singletons, which could represent Norway spruce or conifer specific components of a stress response, a gene co-expression network was inferred, and network modules (NMs) were identified (

 <italic toggle="yes">Tree Physiology</italic> Online) revealed no enrichment of either category within specific NMs. Genes from both categories (conserved/singleton) were integrated across the network and across the range of connectivity measures. As an example, in NM 1:2, the top 10 genes ranked by PageRank, as a measure of network importance/centrality, included two genes with no identified Arabidopsis homolog.
