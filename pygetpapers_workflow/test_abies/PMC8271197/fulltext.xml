Molecular responses to drought stress have been most extensively studied in herbaceous species, mostly considering only aboveground tissues. Coniferous tree species dominate boreal forests, which are predicted to be exposed to more frequent and acute drought as a result of ongoing climate change. The associated impact at all stages of the forest tree life cycle is expected to have large-scale ecological and economic impacts. However, the molecular response to drought has not been comprehensively profiled for coniferous species. We assayed the physiological and transcriptional response of <italic toggle="yes">Picea abies</italic> (L.) H. Karst seedling needles and roots after exposure to mild and severe drought. Shoots and needles showed an extensive reversible plasticity for physiological measures indicative of drought-response mechanisms, including changes in stomatal conductance (<italic toggle="yes">g</italic><sub>s</sub>), shoot water potential and abscisic acid (ABA). In both tissues, the most commonly observed expression profiles in response to drought were highly correlated with the ABA levels. Still, root and needle transcriptional responses contrasted, with extensive root-specific down-regulation of growth. Comparison between previously characterized <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> L. drought-response genes and <italic toggle="yes">P. abies</italic> revealed both conservation and divergence of transcriptional response to drought. In <italic toggle="yes">P. abies</italic>, transcription factors belonging to the ABA responsive element(ABRE) binding/ABRE binding factors ABA-dependent pathway had a more limited role. These results highlight the importance of profiling both above- and belowground tissues, and provide a comprehensive framework to advance the understanding of the drought response of <italic toggle="yes">P. abies</italic>. The results demonstrate that a short-term, severe drought induces severe physiological responses coupled to extensive transcriptome modulation and highlight the susceptibility of Norway spruce seedlings to such drought events.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ABA</kwd><kwd>drought stress</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>Norway spruce</kwd><kwd><italic toggle="yes">Picea abies</italic></kwd><kwd>RNA-Seq</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source>

They are sinks of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and carbon emissions from anthropogenic sources, and are important in balancing the global carbon cycle (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Kirschbaum and Fischlin 1996</xref>, <xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">Pan et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>). Growth conditions in the boreal zone are limiting, with a cold climate and long periods of sub-zero temperatures leading to short growing seasons (<xref rid="ref90" ref-type="bibr">Troeng and Linder 1982</xref>, <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Burton et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>, <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Kneeshaw et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>). Recently, climate change has caused a mean annual temperature increase of 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in high-latitude boreal forests, with temperatures predicted to rise by an additional 5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C by 2100 (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">IPCC 2013</xref>). Observations made in the boreal forest biomes over Fennoscandia, North America and Russia identified accelerated growth in response to higher temperatures and longer growing seasons (<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">Lapenis et&#x000a0;al. 2005</xref>, <xref rid="ref97" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Kauppi et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). However, such positive growth responses are dependent on adequate water availability, and the same studies also reported severe increases in summer drought and evapotranspiration in boreal regions (<xref rid="ref97" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Allen et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>, <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Beck et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">Peng et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>). Drought stress is a major cause of tree mortality and a threat to boreal forest trees, including Norway spruce (<italic toggle="yes">Picea abies</italic> (L.) H. Karst) (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Kellom&#x000e4;ki et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Ge et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>).</p><p>Major insights to biochemical and molecular mechanisms important for plant drought response have been gained from studies of herbaceous plants such as Arabidopsis (<italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> L.), rice (<italic toggle="yes">Oryza sativa</italic> L.) and maize (<italic toggle="yes">Zea maize</italic> L.). To avoid or tolerate water deficit, maintenance of cellular turgor is of high priority and plants therefore accumulate metabolites such as sugars, amino acids and amines (<xref rid="ref86" ref-type="bibr">Tabaeizadeh 1998</xref>). In addition, cellular components such as proteins and membranes require stabilization, which involves late embryogenesis-abundant (LEA) proteins, heat shock proteins (HSPs) and dehydrins, together with the above metabolites, which also function as antioxidants (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Harfouche et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is an important signal leading to the expression of various stress-responsive genes and transcriptional networks (<xref rid="ref94" ref-type="bibr">Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki 2006</xref>). Transcription factors (TFs) from the ABA responsive element(ABRE)-binding proteins (AREB)/ABRE binding factor (ABF), MYB/MYC, NAC, WRKY and NF-Y families have been shown to regulate ABA-responsive gene expression under drought stress (<xref rid="ref83" ref-type="bibr">Singh and Laxmi 2015</xref>). In addition, an ABA-independent pathway for signal transduction under drought stress exists, involving the dehydration-responsive element-binding protein (DREB)/C-repeat binding factor (CBF) TFs, a subfamily of APETALA 2 (AP2)/ethylene-responsive element-binding factor (ERF) transcriptional activators (<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">Nakashima et&#x000a0;al. 2009</xref>).</p><p>Physiological changes, such as stomatal closure, are the primary cause of drought-induced decreases in productivity. Stomatal closure is stimulated by increasing levels of endogenous ABA during drought stress (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Iuchi et&#x000a0;al. 2001</xref>), which consequently results in reduced availability of CO<sub>2</sub> for photosynthesis. Plants differ in their sensitivity to dehydration, with substantial intra- and inter-specific variation in response to drought. Herbaceous and woody ang iosperm species are thought to be mainly anisohydric in that they display a risk-taking behavior, maintaining stomatal conductance (<italic toggle="yes">g</italic><sub>s</sub>) under drought stress in order to maintain productivity (<xref rid="ref73" ref-type="bibr">Sade et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>). In contrast, isohydric species, including most gymnosperms of the <italic toggle="yes">pinophyte</italic>, such as Norway spruce, initiate stomatal closure early during drought and maintain high levels of ABA in the foliage, restricting fast recovery (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Brodribb and McAdam 2013</xref>, <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Brodribb et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). Maintenance of an efficient hydraulic system to ensure transport of water from the soil and to reduce water loss from leaves is especially important in trees, which are long-lived, for optimal plant hydration under seasonally and annually fluctuating environmental conditions (<xref rid="ref68" ref-type="bibr">Raven 1977</xref>, <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Edwards et&#x000a0;al. 1998</xref>). Differences in the regulation of water status can determine survival of trees in response to drought, with improper response mechanisms resulting in mortality either from carbon starvation or hydraulic failure in isohydric and anisohydric species, respectively. It is important to understand how species will respond within this continuum of response mechanisms in light of predicted patterns of intensity, duration and frequency of future drought events (<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">McDowell et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>), which will particularly reduce productivity in ecosystems where the isohydric Pinophyta dominate (<xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr">Roman et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>).</p><p>Roots have an essential role in determining water uptake from the environment and are the first to sense soil water deficit. Norway spruce is often found to have a shallow root system (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Kalliokoski 2011</xref>), with the majority of fine roots located in the upper soil layers (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">B&#x000f8;rja et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>). As such, Norway spruce, and especially seedlings, are highly sensitive to summers with lower precipitation and high evapotranspiration, which will become more prevalent as a result of climate change. The role of ABA production in roots and transport to the foliage to actively reduce guard cell turgor is generally accepted as the primary mechanism mediating stomatal closure during drought stress in herbaceous plants (<xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr">Schroeder et&#x000a0;al. 2001</xref>, <xref rid="ref69" ref-type="bibr">Roelfsema and Hedrich 2005</xref>). However, in trees, the time required for transport of ABA to the leaves via the vascular tissue exceeds the observed time needed to close stomata (<xref rid="ref99" ref-type="bibr">Zimmermann and Brown 1971</xref>, <xref rid="ref78" ref-type="bibr">Schulze and Hall 1982</xref>), and evidence suggests that foliar-derived ABA is sufficient to explain stomatal responses in conifers (<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell et&#x000a0;al. 2017</xref>). The importance of root-derived ABA is therefore questionable (<xref rid="ref92" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson and Davies 2002</xref>), and the relative importance and role of the ABA pools in different plant tissues remains unresolved. The molecular basis of isohydrism has been less studied, but in gymnosperm species, it includes a high sensitivity to ABA (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Brodribb and McAdam 2013</xref>, <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Brodribb et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>).</p><p>A number of studies have examined the physiological and transcriptional drought responses of various coniferous species (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Lorenz et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">Moran et&#x000a0;al. 2017</xref>, <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Du et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>, <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Fox et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>, <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">de Mar&#x000ed;a et&#x000a0;al. 2020</xref>, <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Kl&#x000e1;p&#x00161;t&#x0011b; et&#x000a0;al. 2020</xref>). These have established that ABA has a conserved role in controlling drought-response mechanisms (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Brodribb and McAdam 2013</xref>, <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Brodribb et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">Pashkovskiy et&#x000a0;al. 2019</xref>) and that there is genetically controlled variation in drought response within and between species (<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">Moran et&#x000a0;al. 2017</xref>, <xref rid="ref91" ref-type="bibr">Trujillo-Moya et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>, <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">de Mar&#x000ed;a et&#x000a0;al. 2020</xref>, <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Kl&#x000e1;p&#x00161;t&#x0011b; et&#x000a0;al. 2020</xref>). A common feature of these previous transcriptomics studies was the use of sequence similarity to assign functional descriptions on the basis of the highest sequence similarity homolog. These functional descriptions were nearly exclusively assigned on the basis of work performed using angiosperm species, in particular Arabidopsis. Contemporary studies of drought response in extant species must consider the extensive divergence time of the gymnosperm and angiosperm lineages. Subsequent evolution in both lineages after the split may have resulted in the divergence of both gene regulation and function. As extremely few genes have been functionally characterized in gymnosperm species, caution is needed when using such a sequence similarity-based transfer of functional information.</p><p>This study used RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) to assay the transcriptional response of Norway spruce seedlings experiencing a mild and severe water stress and samples after re-irrigation to determine the extent of expression conservation to typified angiosperm drought-response mechanisms. There was extensive reversible plasticity for physiological responses, including <italic toggle="yes">g</italic><sub>s</sub>, shoot water potential and ABA levels. Needles and roots showed markedly contrasting transcriptome remodulation in response to drought, including differences in plasticity upon re-watering. Additionally, comparison of the transcriptional response with a set of well-characterized Arabidopsis drought-response genes identified regulators with both divergence and conservation at the expression level.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec15"><title>Data and materials availability</title><p>Sequencing data have been deposited at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena</ext-link>) under the accession ID PRJEB26933.

For a controlled drought treatment, the field capacity (FC) of the soil was determined as the difference in the weight of wet soil and dry weight after oven-drying at 70&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Seedlings of the control treatment were kept well watered and monitored gravimetrically to maintain the soil moisture at 80% FC. For a mild drought treatment, water was withheld from the seedlings until soil moisture reduced to 30% FC, 5 days after the initiation of the experiment. Seedlings were kept in this stage of mild drought stress for 7 days by adding the daily evapotranspirational water loss. This was a non-lethal drought stress and above a point where leaf death occurred. A severe drought stress was then imposed by completely withholding water until symptoms of severe dysfunction, as measured by photosynthetic assimilation rates, were observed. At this moment, the severe drought stress was extended for 3 days, bringing plants closer to catastrophic hydraulic failure, before re-irrigation was started. After 4 days of re-watering, soil moisture had returned to the initial well-watered conditions at 80% FC. Needles and fine and small lateral roots (&#x0003c;4&#x000a0;mm) of three to four seedlings were sampled at control (Day 0), mild (2, 4, 5 and 13&#x000a0;days) and severe (18 and 21&#x000a0;days) drought and after re-irrigation (25&#x000a0;days) for RNA-Seq analysis.

As such, caution is needed in interpreting inference of functional ortholog conservation. This likely underlies many of the cases where multiple copies of Norway spruce genes had the highest sequence similarity to a single Arabidopsis gene. For some such cases, there were differences in which gene copy was DE between the tissues. While these potentially represent two genuine copies that have undergone sub-functionalization, such observations require detailed follow-up studies or reconsidering upon the availability of an improved genome assembly or functional validation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec14"><title>Discussion</title><p>Drought stress typically induces short-term physiological and molecular responses that enable plants to survive periods of limited or fluctuating water availability. In roots, these responses are initiated by the limitation of soil water uptake, with root-level responses to this initial limitation being an important component in determining the whole-plant drought tolerance and survival. Despite the importance of root responses, most previous studies have focused on the response of aboveground tissues. In this study, drought-induced transcriptional changes of both roots and needles of Norway spruce seedlings were assayed by subjecting seedlings to a progressively increasing soil water deficit, followed by a recovery phase after re-irrigation. The induced transcriptional responses were placed within a framework of physiological responses observed in needles (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). To explore the extent of conservation in the transcriptional drought response and to determine the appropriateness of utilizing functional annotations derived from other species, the transcriptional response of Norway spruce was compared with previous results in Arabidopsis as the most comprehensively studied model system for drought and other abiotic stress responses and the primary source of gene functional annotation.</p><fig position="float" id="f6"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Overview representation of physiological and gene expression responses to drought in Norway spruce seedlings.

In a similar study of red spruce seedlings (<italic toggle="yes">Picea rubens</italic> Sarg.) photosynthesis continued until water potential decreased to &#x02212;3.0&#x000a0;MPa and was rapidly recovered to 70% of well-watered plants after re-irrigation (<xref rid="ref79" ref-type="bibr">Seiler and Cazell 1990</xref>). In the current experiment, re-irrigation after 21&#x000a0;days resulted in 80% recovery of the photosynthetic rates (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). Nevertheless, the treatment was regarded as severe, with death occurring in a set of seedlings that experienced an additional 2 days of severe drought (indicated by an X symbol in <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). In agreement with this observation, it was reported earlier that Norway spruce seedlings die after crossing a critical point of dehydration (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Ditmarova et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>) and that drought results in the mortality of Norway spruce seedlings (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Ivanov et&#x000a0;al. 2019</xref>). These findings highlight the severe negative effects that could result from the changing patterns of soil water availability as a result of continued climate change.</p><p>The limited physiological response of needles to severe drought was reflected in the transcriptome, with substantially fewer DEGs in needles than in roots (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). This was despite very similar increases in ABA levels in both tissues, suggesting either that the observed increase in ABA was coincidental rather than controlling the induced transcriptional responses or that the two tissues have differential sensitivity to ABA. The known importance of ABA in regulating drought response together with the observed correlation between ABA levels and the predominant expression profile induced by severe drought in both tissues points toward different transcriptional responses being induced by the common ABA signal in the two tissues. In contrast to the needle response, changes in the transcriptome of roots were observed starting at 30% FC, with the response being particularly prominent in response to severe drought (Day 18; <xref rid="sup2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2b</xref> available as Supplementary data at <italic toggle="yes">Tree Physiology</italic> Online). Correspondingly, a greater number of biological processes were significantly altered in roots, particularly categories associated with growth and development. Nevertheless, there was a common enrichment in both tissues of up-regulated genes for &#x02018;response to stress&#x02019;, indicating a core stress response program around which a root-specific extensive down-regulation of genes involved in growth was induced. This is in line with the finding that drought response in conifers is highly dependent on established roots, with the development of new roots being restricted due to carbon costs (<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">Mackay et&#x000a0;al. 2020</xref>) and with previous observations of decreased root growth of Norway spruce seedlings under drought stress (<xref rid="ref100" ref-type="bibr">Zlobin et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>). In needles, metabolism remained largely unchanged, with no enrichment for terms associated with the primary physiological mechanisms of photosynthesis. <xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">Pashkovskiy et&#x000a0;al. (2019</xref>) reported ABA levels in Norway spruce and Scots pine roots and needles in response to drought, finding significantly higher baseline ABA levels and more substantial induction in Norway spruce needles than roots. The current results contrast in that similar ABA levels and extents of increase were recorded in both tissues (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). Further experiments will be needed to determine whether the differences observed in the two studies arise from the substantially different experimental setups used to induce drought stress (water deprivation in the current study and polyethylene glycol within a hydroponic system for Pashkovskiy et&#x000a0;al.) or result from genotypic variation.</p><p>Comparison of transcriptional regulation between species is important to determine the evolution of stress responses and to ascertain the applicability of transferring biological knowledge (i.e., functional annotation descriptions) and selection of targets across species. While a number of studies have examined transcriptome responses to drought in conifer species (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Lorenz et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Du et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>, <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Fox et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>, <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">de Mar&#x000ed;a et&#x000a0;al. 2020</xref>), finding variation between species and among genotypes (<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">de Mar&#x000ed;a et&#x000a0;al. 2020</xref>), it is also of interest to know how extensively functional knowledge generated using angiosperm species translates to coniferous species. Here, indications of both conservation and divergence in transcriptional responses were observed between Arabidopsis and Norway spruce. The conserved component of the Norway spruce response included up-regulation of solute accumulation, ROS scavenging, ABA biosynthesis and signaling, with many genes involved in these processes highly ranked within NMs. In contrast, proline catabolism, ROS production and auxin and cytokinin signaling responses were limited. However, a large proportion of the homologs or orthologs of the characterized Arabidopsis drought-responsive genes considered were not DE in response to drought, suggesting that there are extensive differences as to which genes regulate the induced, common components of the conserved stress response transcriptional program between the two species. For this subset of genes in particular, functional descriptions derived in Arabidopsis potentially do not reflect function in Norway spruce, highlighting the need for species- or lineage-specific functional characterization. Determining whether these diverged transcriptional responses reflect the differences between lineages or is a specific component of the contrasting isohydric versus anisohydric drought-response strategies also requires further studies. In addition to this set of sequence-conserved genes, there were several Norway spruce-specific genes actively regulated in response to drought as has been reported by previous studies of drought stress in a range of conifer species (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Lorenz et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Du et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>, <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Fox et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>, <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">de Mar&#x000ed;a et&#x000a0;al. 2020</xref>). These genes lack functional annotation based on homology and were fully integrated within the co-expression network, making them interesting targets for future characterization studies.</p><p>Differences and parallels between species were identified in the transcriptional response of genes within the ABA signaling pathway. Signaling by plant hormones plays an important role in the early response to drought stress, and production of ABA is a well-recognized component of the typical response to water deficit (<xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr">Schachtman and Goodger 2008</xref>) as well as in conifers more specifically (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Brodribb and McAdam 2013</xref>, <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Brodribb et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">Pashkovskiy et&#x000a0;al. 2019</xref>). In the current study, there were numerous ABA-associated genes present in Cluster 3/NM 1:2, suggesting an expected role for ABA in inducing coordinated gene expression changes. The serine/threonine kinase <italic toggle="yes">SnRK2/OST1</italic>, involved in ABA signaling, serves as a useful example of the potential complications presented when transferring ortholog-inferred annotations across divergent genomes. In Arabidopsis, OST1 functions in the control of stomatal closure, while in the current experiment, the Norway spruce ortholog (MA_10430272g0020) exhibited high and constant expression in needles with no observed change in expression in response to drought. In contrast, expression in roots was highly responsive and correlated to changes in ABA, with a transient, small increase at Day 5 and a dramatic increase during the severe drought. There were also numerous examples, as exemplified by <italic toggle="yes">RD26</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">RD22</italic>, where multiple Norway spruce genes have maximal sequence similarity to a single Arabidopsis ortholog and with those multiple Norway spruce genes having divergent expression between tissues and in response to drought. In contrast to Arabidopsis, members of the bZIP TFs of the ABA-dependent pathway, the AREB/ ABFs (<xref rid="ref83" ref-type="bibr">Singh and Laxmi 2015</xref>), were not DE. While expression of homologs to <italic toggle="yes">AREB1/ABF2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">AREB2/ABF4</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ABF3</italic> increased, these changes were small and not significant, and many of the potential target genes of the ABFs were not DE (<xref rid="sup6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6</xref> available as Supplementary data at <italic toggle="yes">Tree Physiology</italic> Online). As homologs of the ABA-responsive bZIPs are present but were not DE in response to drought, it will be interesting for future work to ascertain whether those bZIPs and their targets have evolved an alternative function in Norway spruce. In contrast, TFs of the ABA-independent <italic toggle="yes">DREB1/CBF</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">DREB2</italic> regulons were significantly DE in roots. <italic toggle="yes">DREB1/CBF</italic> type genes have mainly been reported to be responsive to low temperatures in Arabidopsis (<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">Nakashima et&#x000a0;al. 2009</xref>) but were also up-regulated during water deficit in maize shoots and, to an even greater extent, in roots (<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Liu et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>), with similar expression changes reported in poplar and loblolly pine roots (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>, <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Lorenz et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>). In the current study, expression of <italic toggle="yes">DREB1/CBF</italic> genes was strongly down-regulated in roots and only <italic toggle="yes">DREB2B</italic>, which has a well-defined function in drought stress (<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">Nakashima et&#x000a0;al. 2009</xref>), was up-regulated in roots. Similarly, expression of <italic toggle="yes">ERF53</italic>, which has been proposed to function in a similar manner to <italic toggle="yes">DREB2A</italic> via regulation of drought stress-responsive genes (<xref rid="ref52a" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>), increased under drought stress. Altogether, these findings indicate that there are potential differences in the regulators controlling transcriptional drought response in Norway spruce seedlings compared with the typical response of Arabidopsis.</p><p>While many genes differed in their response to drought between Arabidopsis, several genes with known functional roles in drought tolerance were DE and showed a transcriptional response in needles and roots, suggesting conserved function and making these robust targets for either breeding and selection or genome engineering. The observed drought response involved expression-conserved up-regulation of solute synthesis, such as of malate (<italic toggle="yes">PCK1</italic>) (<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">Penfield et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>), raffinose (RS5/SIP1, <italic toggle="yes">GolS1</italic>) (<xref rid="ref87" ref-type="bibr">Taji et&#x000a0;al. 2002</xref>, <xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">Nishizawa et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Egert et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">Rasheed et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>) or amino acids (<italic toggle="yes">MGL</italic>) (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Joshi and Jander 2009</xref>), and protection of cellular components via expression of dehydrins (<italic toggle="yes">LTI29</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">ERD10</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">LTI45</italic>) (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Kasuga et&#x000a0;al. 2004</xref>) and ROS scavengers (<italic toggle="yes">GSTU19</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">GST8</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">GST30</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">ERD9</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">GSTU17</italic>) (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="ref93" ref-type="bibr">Xu et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>) in both tissues. Furthermore, other regulatory genes had a conserved function in Norway spruce. For example, NAC and MYB TFs, such as <italic toggle="yes">ANAC072</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">RD26</italic>, which were here up-regulated in needles and roots, have been shown to improve drought stress tolerance in Arabidopsis when overexpressed (<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">Nakashima et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>). The <italic toggle="yes">ANAC019</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ANAC072/RD26</italic> genes, here with root-specific expression, have been classified as stress-responsive NAC (SNAC) TFs (<xref rid="ref89" ref-type="bibr">Tran et&#x000a0;al. 2004</xref>). Expression changes of many MYB TFs have been reported during drought stress responses in plants (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Baldoni et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>), including in conifer species (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Lorenz et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Du et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>, <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">de Mar&#x000ed;a et&#x000a0;al. 2020</xref>), although their functional role has not been elucidated. <italic toggle="yes">MYB2</italic> is known to mediate response to abiotic stress and regulate gene expression of ABA-inducible genes (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Abe et&#x000a0;al. 2003</xref>) and to be expressed in both the shoots and roots of Arabidopsis and rice (<xref rid="ref96" ref-type="bibr">Yang et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Baldoni et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>). This gene was DE early on in roots in the current study, suggesting functional conservation, indicating early activation of ABA-induced response mechanisms despite the non-significant increase in ABA levels. Severe drought stress induced <italic toggle="yes">MYB96</italic> in roots, which may function to arrest lateral root growth in a similar manner to the described role in Arabidopsis (<xref rid="ref80" ref-type="bibr">Seo et&#x000a0;al. 2009</xref>). This response is suggested to enable maximal resource allocation to primary root growth to facilitate rapid recovery after cessation of water shortage (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Comas et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>). During recovery, <italic toggle="yes">MYB15</italic> was here expressed in roots and, in Arabidopsis, this gene has been reported as a negative regulator of <italic toggle="yes">DREB1/CBF</italic> genes during cold stress (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Agarwal et&#x000a0;al. 2006</xref>). Potentially, this gene may therefore have a similar function in Norway spruce prior to and during recovery.</p><p>The observed drought-response mechanism highlights the potential for Norway spruce seedlings to experience severe negative effects when exposed to relatively short periods of soil drying. Given the combination of a typically shallow root system and the expected increase in both the frequency and severity of such drought events, there could be substantial ecological and economic implications. This sensitivity to drought is especially relevant to the context of Norway spruce forestry and planting after clear-cut. As a late successional species, Norway spruce is increasingly likely to have maladapted abiotic stress mechanisms when grown in a clear-cut context where conditions are considerably different from those where the Norway spruce seedlings would typically establish. This study provides a comprehensive characterization of the transcriptional drought-response mechanisms in Norway spruce roots and needles, highlighting the substantial difference in the transcriptional response to drought between the two tissues. The extensive down-regulation of genes related to the growth and metabolism in roots would result in a large impact on the seedling growth, establishment and biomass accumulation. There are also associated potential implications that we do not explore in the current study, such as the effects of alternations to microbial community interactions as a result of altered root growth. In contrast to roots, little transcriptional response was observed in needles, reflecting the limited physiological changes in water potential and stomatal conductance shown until severe drought was experienced. Combined with reduced root growth, these effects could have substantial ecological impacts and economic implications, including the effects on carbon sequestration.</p></sec><sec id="sec17"><title>Authors&#x02019; contribution</title><p>J.C.H., V.H. and N.R.S. planned and designed the study.
