<p id="Par24">The final demise of 
 <italic>Abies alba</italic> at Lago Verdarolo starting around 2500 cal BP was likely triggered by enhanced fire occurrence related to farming activities (Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and resulted in the dominance of 
 <italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic> in the montane forests, as indicated by pollen and macrofossil data (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). During the last 2000 years, beech continued its expansion under increasing land-use including arboriculture (
 <italic>Castanea</italic>, 
 <italic>Juglans</italic>, 
 <italic>Olea</italic>), agriculture (Cerealia-t., 
 <italic>Cannabis</italic>) and pastoralism, which likely involved an intense use of fire (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). 
 <italic>Abies alba</italic> kept declining in parallel to enhanced human impact and fire occurrence, until it was probably locally extirpated between about 1000 and 500 cal BP according to the macrofossil and pollen records (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Similarly, other major trees of the formerly dominant mixed forests such as 
 <italic>Acer</italic>, 
 <italic>Carpinus betulus</italic>, 
 <italic>Fraxinus excelsior</italic>, 
 <italic>Tilia</italic> and 
 <italic>Ulmus</italic> turned extremely rare and probably underwent local extinction (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Therefore, the paleoecological data from Lago Verdarolo strongly suggest that the currently widespread (quasi)-monospecific 
 <italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic> stands of the Northern Apennine montane belt are the outcome of millennia of land-use intensification. Beech took advantage of its lower palatability and sensitivity to fire and browsing compared to other co-existing trees to increase its dominance (Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>; Pigott 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">1991</xref>; Tinner and others

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2018</xref>; Rey and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2019</xref>). Previous paleoecological and archeological studies in the region suggested that ancient farming favored beech directly because of the use of beechnuts to feed pigs and indirectly by overexploiting competing trees like 
 <italic>Ulmus</italic>, 
 <italic>Tilia</italic>, 
 <italic>Fraxinus</italic> and 
 <italic>Abies</italic> for foddering (Cruise and others

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>; Branch and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2014</xref>). Later, the dense shade of beech stands would have severely hampered seedling recruitment of more light-demanding species (Vescovi and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2010a</xref>; Branch 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>; Leuschner and Ellenberg
