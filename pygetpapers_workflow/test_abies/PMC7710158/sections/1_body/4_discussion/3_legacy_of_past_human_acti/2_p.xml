<p id="Par25">A few beech-fir forests have persisted until the present-day in the Apennines but, with few exceptions, 
 <italic>Abies alba</italic> plays a markedly subordinate role (Watson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">1996</xref>; Vescovi and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2010a</xref>). Tinner and others (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2013</xref>) already highlighted that land-use and excessive human-induced fires and pastoralism caused widespread declines of 
 <italic>Abies alba</italic> forests throughout the Italian Peninsula, which has a strong impact on modern forest composition and dynamics. Our results show that the legacy of long-lasting human activities extends to the rarity or even absence of many other mesophilous broadleaved deciduous trees that were relatively frequent in the Early and Mid-Holocene forests. Likewise, the widespread monospecific 
 <italic>Fagus</italic> forests that dominate in the montane belt of the Apennines today have been favored, directly or indirectly, by human activities, as it was the case elsewhere in Europe where the species is quite widespread today (Birks and Tinner 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2016</xref>).
