<p id="Par21">The first minor disruption of the mixed fir-dominated forests around 6700 cal BP, involving first forest clearance and the spread of disturbance-tolerant deciduous 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> and 
 <italic>Corylus</italic>, was probably caused by increased fire activity related to pastoral farming (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Our interpretation agrees with previous regional paleoecological and archeological evidence on the use of fire by Neolithic settlers to establish pasturelands for their transhumant livestock herds by clearing mixed fir-dominated forests (Vescovi and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2010a</xref>; Branch and Marini 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2014</xref>). However, the main vegetational shift observed at Lago Verdarolo during the second half of the Holocene was the significant decline of most of the main components of the mixed forests (for example, 
 <italic>Abies alba</italic>, 
 <italic>Fraxinus excelsior</italic>, 
 <italic>Tilia</italic>, 
 <italic>Ulmus</italic>) and the synchronous massive expansion of 
 <italic>Fagus</italic>, starting around 6000 cal BP but particularly striking since about 5400 cal BP (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). 
 <italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic> was most likely the species of beech involved in this expansion, considering the current distribution of the species (San-Miguel-Ayanz and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2016</xref>) and the available fossil evidence from the Italian Peninsula (Magri 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2008</xref>). This process lasted remarkably long, coming to an end only about 600 years ago when 
 <italic>Abies alba</italic> went locally extinct. Mid-to-Late Holocene reductions of 
 <italic>Abies alba</italic> and accompanying/co-dominant deciduous trees coupled with expansions of 
 <italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic> were widespread in the montane belt of the Northern Apennines (for example, Lowe

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2002</xref>; de Beaulieu and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2017</xref>) as well as north of the Po Plain in the Southern Alps and their forelands (Tinner and others

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2000</xref>; Hofstetter and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2006</xref>). As a result, relatively species-poor beech-fir forests replaced the pre-existing highly diverse mixed fir-deciduous forests in the montane belt (Figure

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">1996</xref>; Vescovi and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2010a</xref>). This vegetation shift has been dated in most studied and reasonably well-dated sites between about 7000 and 6000 cal BP in the Northern Apennines (Watson
