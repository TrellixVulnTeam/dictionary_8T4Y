<p id="Par22">Human disturbance was considered the main driver of beech expansion in the Northern Apennines long time ago (see Lowe 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1992</xref>; Lowe and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1994</xref>), although the precise mechanisms involved remained unclear. Thereafter, and because of insufficient taxonomic resolution of pollen indicators of human impact, Watson (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">1996</xref>) proposed an alternative hypothesis involving climatic forcing as the main driver, assisted by disturbance. Later, Vescovi and others (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2010a</xref>), based on refined pollen identification and new evidence for fire occurrence derived from quantitative charcoal data, refined the anthropogenic hypothesis, suggesting that human-set fire during the Neolithic promoted the spread of beech by releasing its light-demanding seedlings from the dense shade of fir forest canopy. Finally, Branch (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>) and Branch and Marini (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2014</xref>) suggested that 
 <italic>Fagus</italic> spread under favorable climatic conditions assisted by human activities such as pastoralism and foddering. However, the lack of pollen-independent climatic reconstructions as well as quantitative records of fire activity hampered testing properly this hypothesis. Here, for the first time, we provide independent paleoclimatic evidence to test these hypotheses. At Lago Verdarolo, mixed species-rich fir-deciduous forests were replaced with 
 <italic>Fagus</italic>-
 <italic>Abies</italic> forests from around 5400 to 2050 cal BP (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) under decreasing summer temperatures (− 2 °C, Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Samartin and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2017</xref>), higher moisture availability (Magny and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2007</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2012</xref>), and slightly increasing farming (continuous curves of 
 <italic>Plantago lanceolata</italic>-t. and 
 <italic>Olea</italic>; Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Additionally, the charcoal record suggests overall higher fire activity during this period, although evidence is not conclusive (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Palynological, paleoclimatic and microclimatic evidence suggests that beech, similarly to silver fir, survived the last glaciation in refugia located in hilly areas of the Po Plain (for example, Colli Euganei) and at the foothills of the Northern Apennines (Magri 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2008</xref>; Kaltenrieder and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>; Samartin and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2016</xref>; Gubler and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2018</xref>; Guido and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>) but, in striking contrast to silver fir, beech did not expand until the Mid-Holocene. Our data suggest that the initial expansion of 
 <italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic> occurred when summers got cooler and fire activity rose to moderate values (Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Likewise, decreasing seasonality and moister summers (Magny and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2012</xref>) may have favored a species very sensitive to late frost such as beech (Packham and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2012</xref>). Additionally, 
 <italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic> is less drought tolerant than 
 <italic>Abies alba</italic>, for instance (Leuschner and Ellenberg 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2017</xref>). The Lago Verdarolo paleoecological record also shows that the tree species at which expense beech expanded (basically 
 <italic>Abies alba</italic>, 
 <italic>Tilia</italic>, 
 <italic>Ulmus</italic> and 
 <italic>Fraxinus excelsior</italic>) responded quite negatively to decreasing summer temperatures and increasing fire occurrence (Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Our results mostly agree with previous research on short- and long-term fire ecology of these species: 
 <italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic> is sensitive to fire but given that competing species (
 <italic>Abies, Ulmus, Tilia, Fraxinus, Picea</italic>) are even more damaged by burning, beech may benefit from moderate-severity fires (Tinner and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2000</xref>; van Gils and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2010</xref>; Packham and others

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2018</xref>; Rey and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2019</xref>). We therefore assume that beech-fir forests replaced mixed fir-deciduous stands because beech became more competitive with the onset of cooler and moister summers and human fire disturbance. A similar conclusion was reached by other authors elsewhere in Europe regarding the removal of particularly sensitive tree species (Bradshaw and Lindbladh 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2005</xref>; Muñoz Sobrino and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2009</xref>). Fir persisted as an important forest component longer than at other sites in the Italian Peninsula because human impact was moderate (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).
