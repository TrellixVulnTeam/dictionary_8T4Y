<p id="Par23">In short, the Lago Verdarolo multi-proxy and high-quality record has allowed us to check the previously formulated competing hypotheses, showing (for the first time with pollen-independent local paleoclimatic reconstructions) that both human disturbance and climate change probably contributed to the Mid-to-Late Holocene expansion of 
 <italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic> in the Northern Apennine forests. Browsing may have also played a major role in favoring 
 <italic>Fagus</italic> against co-existing species more palatable and sensitive to browsing such as 
 <italic>Tilia</italic>, 
 <italic>Ulmus</italic>, 
 <italic>Fraxinus</italic> and 
 <italic>Abies</italic> as proposed by Branch and Marini (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2014</xref>) but the lack of a proxy for grazing, such as coprophilous fungal spores, prevented us from testing this mechanism at Lago Verdarolo.
