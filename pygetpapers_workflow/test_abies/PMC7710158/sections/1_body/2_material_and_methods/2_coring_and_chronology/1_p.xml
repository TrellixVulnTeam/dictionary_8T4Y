<p id="Par6">In August 2009, we retrieved two parallel cores from the deepest section of Lago Verdarolo with a modified Livingstone piston corer. The two cores were correlated according to their lithostratigraphy to produce a master sequence (855-cm long). The chronology relies on 13 accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates of terrestrial plant macrofossils (Table S1), which were calibrated to calendar years Before Present (cal BP, with 0 BP = 1950 CE) using the IntCal13 calibration curve (Reimer and others

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2005</xref>). Given the unrealistic estimates provided by this model for the topmost section of the sequence, we used linear interpolation to estimate the ages of the samples between the uppermost radiocarbon date and the core top. The radiocarbon dates and the age-depth model were first published in Samartin and others (
