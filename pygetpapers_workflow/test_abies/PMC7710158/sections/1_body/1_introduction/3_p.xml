<p id="Par4">Recently published quantitative Holocene summer temperature reconstructions inferred from fossil chironomid (non-biting midges) assemblages from two lakes in the Northern Apennines (Samartin and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2017</xref>) open the door to more thorough and independent assessments of the main drivers of Mediterranean mountain forest dynamics. In this paper, we present novel well-dated multi-proxy paleoecological data (pollen, spores, macrofossils, microscopic and macroscopic charcoal) from Lago Verdarolo (Tuscan-Emilian Apennines). These data are compared with an independent Holocene temperature reconstruction from the same lake, which was replicated in a second site in the Apennines (Samartin and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2017</xref>), using multivariate and regression techniques to provide new insights into the long-term responses of Apennine forests to climate change, fire activity and human disturbance. Our specific aims are: (1) to track the vegetation responses to Late Glacial and Early Holocene abrupt climatic changes, (2) to assess the long-term ecology of Early and Mid-Holocene mixed forests, (3) to disentangle the ecological factors driving the shift from highly diverse mixed forests to beech-dominated stands, and (4) to assess the occurrence of legacy effects on present-day forests. In a final step, we aim at providing recommendations for the future management of these forests under future warmer and drier climate.
