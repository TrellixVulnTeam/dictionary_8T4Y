<p id="Par2">Global change, including human-induced climatic change and rapid shifts in land-use, is posing serious threats to forest ecosystems and diversity and urging the adoption of adaptation and mitigation measures across Europe (Thuiller and others

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2017</xref>) dominated by many European temperate and boreal tree species that reach here the southern limit of their distribution ranges (San-Miguel-Ayanz and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2016</xref>). Currently, such species are experiencing growth decreases associated to ongoing climate change (Piovesan and others

However, dendroecological research has shown that southern beech populations have exhibited severe growth reductions and symptoms of decline under recent drought, which suggest that their future persistence under forecasted warmer and drier summers is uncertain (Piovesan and others

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2010</xref>; Vescovi and others 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2010a</xref>), this topic, which is crucial for ecosystem functioning and future management, remains largely unknown, especially in the long term (Vacchiano and others
