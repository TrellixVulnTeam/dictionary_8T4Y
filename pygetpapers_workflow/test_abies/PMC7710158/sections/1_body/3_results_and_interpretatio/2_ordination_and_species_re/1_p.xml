<p id="Par15">The first two PCA axes explain together 69.2% of the variation in the Lago Verdarolo pollen dataset (Axis 1 42.4%, Axis 2 26.8%; Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). Positive species scores in Axis 1 are reached by, on the one hand, taxa typical of steppic or open vegetation (for example, 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic>, Poaceae, Apiaceae) and the pioneer 
 <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic>-t. and, on the other hand, meso-thermophilous trees and shrubs (for example, 
 <italic>Abies, Acer, Corylus, Fraxinus excelsior</italic>-t., 
 <italic>Tilia</italic> and 
 <italic>Ulmus</italic>). These taxa are dominant in Late Glacial and Early and Mid-Holocene pollen assemblages, which also feature high sample scores. In contrast, Axis 1 sample scores of Late Holocene pollen assemblages as well as species scores of their dominant/most characteristic taxa, that is, 
 <italic>Fagus</italic>, anthropogenic pollen indicators (for example, Cerealia-t., 
 <italic>Plantago lanceolata</italic>-t., 
 <italic>Cannabis</italic>, 
 <italic>Castanea</italic>, 
 <italic>Olea</italic>), and submediterranean trees (that is, 
 <italic>Ostrya</italic>-t., 
 <italic>Fraxinus ornus</italic>-t.) are negative (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). These results suggest that the first axis of the PCA is reflecting a gradient in anthropogenic disturbance, with positive values associated with less disturbed vegetation and negative values linked to increasing human-induced disturbance (mostly farming) and beech forests. Indeed, when plotting PCA Axis 1 sample scores against time (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E) it becomes evident that the PCA curve mostly runs parallel to that of 
 <italic>Fagus</italic> (after its establishment; Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>J) and to those of anthropogenic pollen indicators (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B, C). On PCA Axis 2, strongly positive species scores correspond to steppic taxa particularly abundant in Late Glacial pollen assemblages (for example, 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic>, Poaceae, 
 <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic>-t.), taxa typical of the Early and Mid-Holocene mixed meso-thermophilous forests (for example, 
 <italic>Abies</italic>, 
 <italic>Acer</italic>, 
 <italic>Fraxinus excelsior</italic>-t.) bear strongly negative scores, and taxa relevant in Late Holocene pollen assemblages like 
 <italic>Fagus</italic>, anthropogenic pollen indicators (for example, Cerealia-t., 
 <italic>Plantago lanceolata</italic>-t., 
 <italic>Cannabis</italic>, 
 <italic>Castanea</italic>) and submediterranean trees have intermediate sample scores, from slightly negative to moderately positive (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). Plotting PCA Axis 2 sample scores against age shows that the curve follows very similar trends to those of tree pollen, thus suggesting a close connection with vegetation openness (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E, F).
