 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported 407 wind-related tree failures causing death in the United States over the period 1997–2007. Another study by Dunster [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] reported an average annual increase of 39.9 online reported injuries and 23.4 online reported deaths by Google alerts for tree failure. From 2001–2010 one incident of tangible damage was estimated per 19,000 inhabitants in the Netherlands, with paid compensations up to € 49,296 [

 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Apart from the frequency and impact of failure, the risk of tree failure is also affected by the failure potential of urban trees. Despite fluctuations in failure over time, for the majorities of urban trees the lifespan is limited. Smith, Dearborn and Hutyra [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] estimated the probability of an urban tree surviving 35 years to be 35.1 ± 8.6%, compared to the survival of a rural tree, i.e. 44.2 ± 4.5%. The failure potential includes tree characteristics and external factors that increase the risk of failure. Tree owners have tree risk assessments executed regularly, in order to prevent failure and estimate the failure potential and iterative necessary maintenance of the trees owned [
