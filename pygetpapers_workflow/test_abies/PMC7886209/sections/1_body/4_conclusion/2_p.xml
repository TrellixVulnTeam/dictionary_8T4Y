<p>In the literature there is no commonly shared understanding, model or function available which expresses the joint distribution of factors explaining tree failure. The widely scattered range of factors together with the low number of studies and sample sizes reported for each factor complicates estimations of the failure potential of species based on tree characteristics and external factors.</p>
