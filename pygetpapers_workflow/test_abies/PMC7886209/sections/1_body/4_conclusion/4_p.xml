<p>For the factors Stem weight and Tree weight this study provides evidence that these positively relate to root failure. For root failure the results indicate the presence of heterogeneity between different effect sizes (i.e. species) for Diameter Breast Height
 <sup>2</sup> times Height of coniferous trees, Stem mass and Tree mass. For the factors Angle of stem at maximum moment applied, Crown area, Diameter Breast Height, Diameter Breast Height
 <sup>2</sup>, Diameter Breast Height
 <sup>2</sup> times Height deciduous trees, Height, and Root plate soil depth, the small number of effect sizes makes it impossible to determine any heterogeneity.
