<p>The results provide evidence that the factors Height and Stem weight positively relate to stem failure, followed by Age, Diameter Breast Height, Diameter Breast Height squared times Height, and Cubed Diameter Breast Height (DBH
 <sup>3</sup>) and Tree weight. For stem failure there is heterogeneity between different effect sizes (i.e. species) for the factors Diameter Breast Height and the related factors Diameter Breast Height
 <sup>3</sup> and Diameter Breast Height
 <sup>2</sup> times Height, Stem volume, Tree weight and Stem weight for coniferous trees. For the factors Age, Crown area, Crown width and Stem weight for deciduous trees, the small number of effect sizes makes it impossible to detect heterogeneity. For the factor Height there is absence of heterogeneity between effect sizes.
