<p>Studies discussing tree failure commonly discuss root failure, stem failure, branch failure, or a combination of two of the tree failure types. The literature search resulted in 161 observational studies as described in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246805.g001">Fig 1</xref>. These 161 studies reported effect sizes which were associated with factors relating to one of the three failure types directly and indirectly. From the included studies direct and indirect effect sizes were collected, which are given in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246805.s002">S1 Table</xref> for stem failure, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246805.s003">S2 Table</xref> for root failure and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246805.s004">S3 Table</xref> for branch failure. A separate overview of studies with significant and non-significant reported effect sizes per species is available upon request.
