<p>The majority of studies in the systematic review reported wind as the primary cause of tree failure, followed by fungi as primary cause. Studies which investigate stem failure also mentioned other causes as fungi and decay. Increasing tree age and decreasing vigour can occur at the same time. However, urban environmental circumstances cause trees to decline at a relatively young age. Other primary causes of tree failure mentioned are a deferred incompatibility of graft-rootstock union, civil engineering activities causing damage, drought resulting in a lower turgor pressure, the appearance of ice and rockfall. Apart from wind, studies which investigate root failure reported a shortage (drought) or abundance (soil saturation) of water supply, the presence of fungi and decay, and unbalance of the tree by branches which had grown disproportionally as other causes. Studies with the focus on branch failure reported additionally weak branch unions in case of bark inclusion, cracks or sharp bends, branches that have grown out of proportion behaving like codominant stems or lion tailing, weak or absent graft unions. Branches also fail because of gravitational loading by precipitation of ice or snow and because of the presence of fungi causing decay.</p>
