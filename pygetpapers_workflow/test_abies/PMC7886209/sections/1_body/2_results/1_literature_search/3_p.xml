<p>These 161 studies report correlations related to one of the three failure types and correlations between the 142 factors. Each factor related to one of the failure types was included in the meta-analysis when multiple studies reported this factor. The studies reporting associated factors with stem failure comprised 320 species, for root failure 102 species and for branch failure 32 species. 
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> provides an overview of the distribution of species and studies per tree class and failure type.
