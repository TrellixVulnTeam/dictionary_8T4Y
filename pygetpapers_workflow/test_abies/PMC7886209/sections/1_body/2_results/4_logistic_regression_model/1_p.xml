<p>Individual binary logistic regressions were estimated on the presence of failure reported in the studies of the systematic review and the reported factors Diameter Breast Height (DBH), Height, Slenderness (Height/Diameter) and climate zone. The results showed a significant difference in the number of studies reporting failure for DBH, Height and climate zones. DBH, Height and climate zones do explain the variation in study populations from studies that report failure. See for detailed statistical information Tables
