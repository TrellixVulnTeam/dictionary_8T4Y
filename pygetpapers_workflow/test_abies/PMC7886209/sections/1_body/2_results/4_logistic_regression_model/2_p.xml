<p>A full binary logistic regression model was fitted on failure reported in the included studies in the systematic review and climate regions, Height, DBH and Slenderness (see

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246805.s008">S4 Text</xref>). The results indicate that DBH and Slenderness cannot be used worldwide in every climate region to predict tree failure. The marginal effects calculated from the regression results indicate small deviations of DBH for different climate zones (see
