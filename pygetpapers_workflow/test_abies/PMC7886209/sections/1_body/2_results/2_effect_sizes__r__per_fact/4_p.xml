<p>The values above 50% for I
 <sup>2</sup>, occurring for the majority of factors for stem failure and the four factors for root failure, depict that more than half of the total heterogeneity originates from between-study variance which cannot be explained by sampling error exclusively. Meanwhile the studies are heterogeneous since the underlying true effect sizes vary (H
 <sub>0</sub>: τ
 <sup>2</sup> = 0 is rejected in favour of H
 <sub>1</sub>: τ
 <sup>2</sup> &gt; 0).
