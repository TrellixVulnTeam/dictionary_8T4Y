<p>A total of 14 different factors have been analysed and interpreted, of which 12 relate to stem failure and 9 relate to root failure. No studies were found which reported correlations between any factor and branch failure. Most of these factors were reported in only a few studies and a comparison was executed in case of two or more reported effect sizes [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The total variation of each factor accounted for in the included studies, is represented by the value of the weighted mean correlation coefficients for stem failure and for root failure in Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.t005" ref-type="table">5</xref> respectively. In general the standard errors for root failure are larger than the standard errors for stem failure. This corresponds with a larger total sample size on average per study for stem failure contrary to root failure.
