<p>A growing body of literature especially for broadleaf trees, may also allow further elucidation of tree risk assessment methods. Several studies show that pruning activities which contribute to a crown length that is proportionally formed with tree height or which reduce the slenderness factor improve tree stability and reduce failure [

 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Currently, tree risk assessment methods lack a body of observational literature that can substantiate these tree risk assessment methods quantitatively. This study emphasizes the relevance of collecting data on research done by arborists and of recording data on trees by tree owners (e.g. municipalities) for the factors Height, Stem weight and Tree weight. Additionally, this study provides quantitative support for factors arborists collect information about during an assessment, e.g. the Diameter at Breast Height, Height and Age of a tree. This does not mean that other factors should not be investigated, recorded and analyzed. Other observational studies might reveal more relevant factors.
