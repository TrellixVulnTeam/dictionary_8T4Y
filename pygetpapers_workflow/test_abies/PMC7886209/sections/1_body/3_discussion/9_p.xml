<p>The low numbers of effect sizes in combination with heterogeneity, limit the possibility of generalizable conclusions for stem or root failure. Since studies from non-English journals are limited in this study, the findings of this study may not hold globally. The search strategy of backward referencing can result in citation bias, because of the many possible motivations there are for citing an article [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>].â€”The use of other keyword combinations relating to the results mentioned in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246805.g001">Fig 1</xref> (e.g. causes AND tilt AND diseases, causes AND fungi AND failure) might have provided a higher yield of included studies.
