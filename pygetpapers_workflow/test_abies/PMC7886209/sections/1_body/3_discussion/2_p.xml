<p>Most of the reviewed studies originate from Anglo-Saxon countries (United States, United Kingdom and Australia). This can be explained from the facts that urban forestry as a research field has been present in those countries since the 1800s and that urban forestry was established as part of the culture and institutionalised by policies and legislation [

The observational character of the majority of studies included, was limited to trees that failed and did not include data on the same factors for the trees which did not fail, which hampers the determination of a failure probability. In (urban) tree failure situations it is not always possible to extract randomized evidence from real-life effects. At best a comparison group can be formed of trees exposed to similar circumstances, expressing survival rates [

 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The 161 factors initially found, depict a widely scattered set of explanatory factors which can predict tree failure. This is in line with other studies which report that there is currently no accurate method available to predict tree failure [
