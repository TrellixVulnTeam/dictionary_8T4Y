<p>Apart from the factors for which effect sizes were found there are also other factors mentioned in literature for which effect sizes were not found: structural defects [

Absence of effect sizes (r) is partly understandable since the data collected in these studies cannot always be measured or assumed to be uniform. The limited number of studies reporting data on the level of individual species for individual factors, contribute to the absence of effect sizes as well.
