<p>The meta-analysis presents an analysis on 14 different factors which are directly significantly associated with stem or root failure. Stem failure and root failure are the most common types of tree failure [

 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The analysis on the Bayes Factor clearly indicates that the data of some of the factors is present in case of stem or root failure, confirming the effects reported in the corresponding literature. No effect sizes were found that are directly related to branch failure. Only one study reported correlations of factors related to breaking stress of branch failure, which is not enough for a statistical comparison in a meta-analysis. The limited results in the literature can be explained by the relatively recent attention for this failure type.
