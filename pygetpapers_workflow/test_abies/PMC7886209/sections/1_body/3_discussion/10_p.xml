<p>The wide range of reported factors which are associated with stem, root or branch failure, complicates the determination of critical values for these factors and the prediction of failure. The number of studies which show effect sizes of factors that are directly associated with stem failure is often too small to estimate whether the published data of those studies emerge in case of stem or root failure. An increase in the number of studies reporting effect sizes which can be associated directly to any failure type (stem/root/branch), is indispensable for future investigations on tree failure. It is also important to report effect sizes both for trees that failed and trees that did not fail. As can be seen from this study effect sizes are not always reported very precisely. Likewise corresponding p-values are often reported as a disparity (&gt; / &lt; 0.05) instead of a more exact figure. In case of a comparison of effect sizes and/or corresponding p-values, the more precise these are the more accurate the interpretation of a comparison can be [
