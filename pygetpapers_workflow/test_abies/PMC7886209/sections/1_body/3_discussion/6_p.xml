<p>The available effect sizes for stem failure and root failure predominantly originate from coniferous trees, while the majority of trees in urban conditions are broadleaf deciduous or broadleaf evergreen trees. Although differences in growth between urban trees and rural trees decline with increasing age, in the temperate climate zone growth of urban trees has been slower than of rural trees [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. This could have affected the strength of the effect sizes (correlations) reported in the included studies and influenced heterogeneity. This study also shows that the associated effect sizes are not always observed consistently across studies, even after categorizing the effect sizes for coniferous or deciduous. Other studies indicated that predictive relationships for tree failure of conifers do not apply to open-grown deciduous trees for a variety of reasons. The crown structure and dynamic properties (e.g. natural frequency, damping ratio) of broadleaf trees contrasts with coniferous trees [

 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. The anatomical structure of the wood differs between coniferous and broadleaf trees, providing both with different stem dynamics [

 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. The presence of heterogeneity can be explained by four different influences: (1) The invisibility of the presence of internal defects before a tree actually fails [

 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], (2) the biomechanical properties of green wood which can differ even for individual trees of the same species [

 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>], (3) the growing conditions influencing morphological differences between urban trees in different climate zones [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] and (4) the strength of the correlation between a factor and any failure type which is influenced by its habitat [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. A complicating issue is that the presence of external causes of tree failure like decay can contribute largely to individual differences between trees. Ribeiro et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] showed that in trees (
 <italic>Eperua glabriflora (Ducke) Cowan</italic>) with a similar DBH, the presence of decay influenced the variation of stem fresh wood density both radially (1.02 g cm
 <sup>-3</sup> at 38 cm in DBH and 0.594 g cm
 <sup>-3</sup> at 35.3 cm in DBH) and axially.
