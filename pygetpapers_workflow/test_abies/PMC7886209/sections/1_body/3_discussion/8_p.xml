<p>To provide a more accurate estimate all effect sizes, significant, negative and positive have been included. No non-significant effect sizes were found for the factors included in the meta-analysis, except for DBH and stem failure. Assner and Goldstein [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>] investigated relationships between DBH and stem failure with data collected from five different broadleaf species and found a non-significant negative effect size of -0.15 (p &gt; 0.05) between DBH and stem failure. In their discussion they mentioned that this is not in line with results from other studies they found. In the search results of this study, this was the only non-significant effect size found.
