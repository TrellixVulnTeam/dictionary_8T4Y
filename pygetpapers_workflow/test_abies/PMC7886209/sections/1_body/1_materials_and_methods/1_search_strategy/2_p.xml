<p>Given the wide range of related fields and to avoid missing relevant studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], backward referencing was applied manually on references to identify additional relevant studies. Reference lists of primary papers, review articles and proceedings of symposia were crosschecked. Articles were selected that describe the influence of factors on the stability, failure or hazardousness of trees in urban regions or forestry. Additional manual searches were performed using the names of authors (forward and backward searching) known to have conducted research into tree failure. In the search three bibliographies were found, which were backward referenced [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], to identify relevant publications which were not included yet.
