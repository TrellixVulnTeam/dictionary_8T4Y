<p>We tested for publication bias by conducting the Egger regression test. Additionally, funnel plots have been drawn [

 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In case of a small number of studies the publication bias is generally larger [

 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The Cochrane handbook mentions a minimum of 10 studies or effect sizes [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Some studies set eight effect sizes as a rule of thumb for the minimum number for drawing a conclusion [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. When there are multiple studies which report effect sizes for a specific factor, the minimum included number of effect sizes in this study for analysing publication bias is eight. Since publication bias deals with the probability that significant effects are more often published than non-significant effects, both significant and non-significant effect sizes are reported.
