<p>Binary logistic regressions are used to explore the conditional probability that a factor or climate zone is associated with the presence of failure in the study populations [

 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. A smaller sample size lower than 50 can be sufficient if the aim of the analysis is to determine factors which are highly associated with an outcome [
 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The minimum sample size to process valid estimates and standard errors for binary logistic regression models has been estimated to be more than 20 [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246805.s008">S4 Text</xref> in this regard. From the 161 studies included in the systematic review only the factors DBH, Height and Slenderness were reported often enough [

 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], and 92 studies were included in this analysis. The identification of the climate zones of the locations reported in each study has been based on the KÃ¶ppen climate classification [
