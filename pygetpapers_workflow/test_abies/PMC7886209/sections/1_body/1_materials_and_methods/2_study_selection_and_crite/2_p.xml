<p>In a subsequent step, all included studies were assessed on their methodological quality, for the first time by the first author and for the second time by the second, third and fourth author for root, stem and branch failure, respectively. Any discrepancies between the first and second author were again assessed by both authors. This did not lead to further discrepancies. The methodological quality of the selected studies was assessed by criteria based on Pai et al. [

 <xref rid="pone.0246805.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Seven criteria were adjusted for the field of tree failure, i.e. study design, analysis, description of the study population (forest, urban trees, open tree, orchard), data collection (prospective or retrospective), inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, and full description of the relation to tree failure. The quality criteria including the scoring system are available in
