<p>We collected and examined articles for reported effect sizes of factors related to tree failure and included studies that assessed single or multiple case studies. After conducting the search, titles and scope were screened to make sure the studies mentioned tree failure in relation to (urban) forestry or trees. Abstracts were assessed to check that these studies investigated tree failure. The articles were then checked in detail to verify the following inclusion criteria: 1) reporting of empirical data, i.e. qualitative studies were excluded, because of the absence of any measurements or associations of factors with tree failure; 2) investigation of tree failure in relation to a factor; 3) availability of full text; 4) provision of statistical data or an effect size, (articles with a biomechanical or statistical analysis do not always meet this criterion); 5) branch failure not due to abscission. This process was initially executed by the first author and then reviewed by the second author for root failure, by the third author for stem failure and by the fourth author for branch failure. In case of any differences the article was discussed and when for at least one of the researchers the study seemed relevant, the full text was assessed.</p>
