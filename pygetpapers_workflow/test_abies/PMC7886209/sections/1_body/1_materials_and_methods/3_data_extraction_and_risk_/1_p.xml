<p>The selected studies were reviewed and the data extracted from the selected studies were tabulated using MS Excel for Windows. Data were registered at the level of individual species. The different studies were categorized by type of failure and factor. Furthermore detailed information was collected on author(s), year, country of the study, external influences, and sample size. Contrary to case studies, cohort studies and randomized trials were largely absent in the search results, which can influence study publication bias, since trees which did not fail while being exposed to the same circumstances are rarely mentioned in the selected studies. Data extraction was conducted twice, for the first time by the first author and for the second time the data was verified by the second, third and fourth author for root, stem and branch failure respectively. Data was extracted from the full texts of articles and supplementary materials. In case of discrepancies the data was assessed for a second time. Several studies contributed to more than one factor with multiple effect sizes, which can affect the independence of effect sizes. However, not considering them would have decreased the number of samples (i.e., number of available effect sizes).
