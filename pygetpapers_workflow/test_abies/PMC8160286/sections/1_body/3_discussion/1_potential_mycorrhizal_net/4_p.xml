<p>No or small differences in quantitative parameters between treatments could be also related to a common problem in evaluating the responses of fungal communities to environmental factors or management. Generally, most fungal communities are composed of a small number of dominant species with a wide ecological valence that only respond to very pronounced gradients. These species are accompanied by few subdominant species and numerous rare species. Due to their rarity and the patchiness of ECM fungi dropping after 3–4 m (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Lilleskov et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Pickles et al., 2012</xref>), it is impossible to disentangle the random occurrence of these species and their response to environmental factors without including many more research plots and more intensive root sampling. 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Rosinger et al. (2018)</xref> found the majority of ECM taxa in one or two plots out of approximately 100 plots. While the overall fungal diversity in temperate forests is high, the species diversity at small scales is low and does not usually exceed 10–20 species (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Tedersoo et al., 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the theoretical absence of a few species for a total area of 10 times 125 m
 <sup>2</sup> could indicate larger losses at larger scales. However, this hypothesis must be verified by further research focusing on the ecology of rare ECM fungal species, in which all the above mentioned limitations would be taken into consideration (i.e., rarity and patchiness of ECM fungal species and sampling effort). The combination of fruit body monitoring together with environmental soil sequencing could be a promising nondestructive method, but unfortunately without data on the associations with host trees.
