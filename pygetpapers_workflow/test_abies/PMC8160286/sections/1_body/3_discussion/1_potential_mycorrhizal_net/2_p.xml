<p>In contrast to our hypothesis, we also found almost no difference in the total number of potentially shared ECM fungal species among different tree species between the traditionally managed plots (EXT) and plots without management (NEX). Even if we focus on ECM species with exploration types with rhizomorphs, we found no significant differences, although the numbers of species shared by all tree species slightly differ in favor of NEX. Exploration types with rhizomorphs are more carbon demanding compared with contact and short-distance types (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bakker et al., 2006</xref>). So, a higher number of these species per plot in NEX could be explained by lower damage to the mycelium caused by management practices, since hyphae are able to emanate from dying or recently dead root tips for a short time (
