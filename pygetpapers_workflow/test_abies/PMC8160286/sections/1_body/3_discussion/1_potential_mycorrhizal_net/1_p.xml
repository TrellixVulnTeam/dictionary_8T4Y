<p>Our study on the effect of different management practices on ECM fungal communities of regenerating trees in the post-windstorm area in the Tatra Mts. revealed no effect on dominant ECM fungi and their potential to form mycorrhizal networks. For both treatment types, five ECM fungal species with broad host range dominated and included both early-colonizers (
 <italic>C. geophilum</italic>, 
 <italic>P. involutus</italic>, and 
 <italic>T. terrestris</italic>) and late-successional ECM fungi (
 <italic>L. rufus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. olivaceum</italic>;
