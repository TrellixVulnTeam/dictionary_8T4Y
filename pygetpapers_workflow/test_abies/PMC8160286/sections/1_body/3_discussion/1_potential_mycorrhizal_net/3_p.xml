<p>Norway spruce was the only tree species, which showed a higher number of specific ECM fungal species in NEX than in EXT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This difference is also evident from rarefaction curves (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). In contrast to other tree species in our study, Norway spruce is a shade-tolerant species, which is able to regenerate under mature forest canopies (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Metslaid et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, Norway spruce requires an adequate water supply. 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Gömöryová et al. (2008)</xref> detected lower soil moisture levels 2 years after the windstorm in EXT compared with NEX, which could, along with the increased insolation following tree removal, negatively affect spruce fitness. The better Norway spruce seedling fitness in NEX (although not supported by morphological characteristics) combined with the connectivity of the original forest could explain the differences observed. In contrast, both silver birch and European larch possessed the same numbers of specific ECM symbionts in both treatments. The highest ECM fungal species richness in silver birch can be the consequence of its larger dimensions related to its pioneer strategy and higher adaptability to clear-cut sites (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dubois et al., 2020</xref>). Similar findings were also reported by 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Twieg et al. (2007)</xref>, who detected more ECM fungal species on paper birch than Douglas fir in young stands after clear-cut logging. However, in that case, the higher species richness of paper birch was also attributed to the presence of birch stumps.
