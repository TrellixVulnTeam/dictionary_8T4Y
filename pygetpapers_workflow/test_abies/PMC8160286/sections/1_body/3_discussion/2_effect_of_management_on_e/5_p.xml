<p>In conclusion, different post-windstorm management practices do not significantly influence the potential for mycorrhizal networking among Norway spruce, European larch, and silver birch, which is mostly provided by common ECM fungal species with broad ecological niches. Management type affects the ECM fungal species compositions on Norway spruce and European larch; however, the consequences are difficult to assess without knowledge of the ecology and physiology of the affected ECM fungi. Norway spruce in NEX harbored a higher number of unique species than in EXT, but extremely intensive sampling is required to evaluate the possible loss of rare species due to traditional management.</p>
