<p>The observed differences in ECM fungi composition between NEX and EXT in Norway spruce are difficult to explain because there are no clear patterns in exploration types (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Agerer, 2001</xref>) or spore characteristics (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Bernicchia and Gorjón, 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Knudsen and Vesterholt, 2012</xref>). We also do not expect differences in ability to spread, because both treatments contain species with pileate and resupinate fruit bodies (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Lilleskov and Bruns, 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Halbwachs et al., 2016</xref>). However, the affinity of 
 <italic>T. fibrillosa</italic> and 
 <italic>T. terrestris</italic> for NEX and of 
 <italic>A. byssoides</italic> and 
 <italic>T. asterophora</italic> for EXT has been previously observed in 4–9-year-old seedlings from a similar area in the Tatra Mts. (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Vašutová et al., 2018</xref>), and these differences persist in Norway spruce between treatments. These differences are difficult to evaluate without detailed knowledge of the ECM fungal ecology and physiology. European larch trees are often occupied by 
 <italic>C. bataillei</italic>, 
 <italic>L. laccata</italic>, 
 <italic>P. olivaceum</italic>, and 
 <italic>T. terrestris</italic> in NEX and by 
 <italic>Suillus</italic> spp. in EXT. 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Coleman et al. (1989)</xref> found several 
 <italic>Suillus</italic> spp. to be drought tolerant, and in contrast, 
 <italic>L. laccata</italic> was not drought tolerant, which could partly explain the observed differences.
