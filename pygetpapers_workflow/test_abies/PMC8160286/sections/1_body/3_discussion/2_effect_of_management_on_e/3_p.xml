<p>Although the studied sites were chosen to be the same as each other and the lack of differences in silver birch-associated ECM fungal community supported a good experimental design, we could not fully exclude the differences in ECM fungal community of original Norway spruce forest with European larch and Scotch pine admixtures (
 <italic>Lariceto</italic>–
 <italic>Picetum</italic>) that persisted in spores and as mycorrhizae on surviving seedlings. It would be interesting to determine whether these differences will persist 10–15 years later when ECM fungal diversity should be saturated after canopy closure (
