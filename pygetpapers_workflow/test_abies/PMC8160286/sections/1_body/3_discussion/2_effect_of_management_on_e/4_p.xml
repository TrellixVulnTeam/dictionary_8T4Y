<p>Regarding the effects of vertical distribution on the ECM fungal species composition, 
 <italic>Tylospora</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Amphinema</italic> spp., and 
 <italic>Meliniomyces</italic> spp. showed an affinity for an organic layer, and 
 <italic>Tomentella</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudotomentella</italic> spp. showed an affinity for an organo-mineral layer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), as was previously observed by 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Tedersoo et al. (2003)</xref>. They detected athelioid and thelephoroid species as indicators of organic layers, but 
 <italic>Tomentella</italic> spp. were present in all horizons depending on the species. These findings support the importance of vertical niche partitioning, as was already discussed by 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bahram et al. (2015)</xref>.
