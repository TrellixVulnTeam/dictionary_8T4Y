<p>The numbers of ECM fungal species shared by all tree species, a combination of two tree species, or unique for a single tree species were calculated for the entire dataset, EXT and NEX treatments and separately for each plot. The same approach was used in assessing the number of species with the exploration types with rhizomorphs (long-distance exploration type, medium-distance fringe exploration type, and medium-distance smooth exploration type), which could in particular provide networking.</p>
