<p>Three datasets were prepared for relating the plot variables (
 <italic>n</italic> = 20), trees (
 <italic>n</italic> = 120), and root samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 359). Presence/absence data (roots) and number of root samples with each morphotype (trees, plots) were used to avoid difficulties in the proper identification of not well-developed morphotypes. The datasets were separately analyzed by multivariate methods in Canoco 5 program (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">ter Braak and Å milauer, 2012</xref>), using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). DCA was used to compare the ECM fungal species compositions in plots, trees, and roots. The year of sampling was used as a covariate. CCA was used to identify (i) the effects of management, vegetation cover, and geographical position on ECM fungal species composition in plots; (ii) the effects of management, tree species, height, and perimeter on ECM fungal species composition in trees; and (iii) the effects of management, tree species, distance from tree stem, and soil horizon on the ECM fungal species composition in roots. The dataset trees was divided based on tree species identity, and the resulting datasets were further analyzed separately. Various environmental variables were tested as explanatory variables in CCA analyses. Year (for all datasets) and plot identifier in interaction with year (only for datasets roots and trees) were used as covariates. We used hierarchical split-plot design for permutations and permutated whole plots (i.e., keeping the data from one plot together) for testing the effect of management. These whole plots were permuted at random within the covariate year, and the two split plots (trees) were not permuted. The effect of tree species was tested by split-plot permutations (within the whole plot, i.e., the data from different tree species were permutated within the plot). The effects of explanatory variables were summarized in partial analyses after removing the effects of covariates. The Monte Carlo permutation test was used and only significant variables were selected.
