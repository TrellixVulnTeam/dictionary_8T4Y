<p>Sequence chromatograms were analyzed using Chromas Lite v.2.6.5 (Technelysium Pty Ltd, Brisbane, Australia), and the sequences were blasted against the UNITE (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abarenkov et al., 2010</xref>) and GenBank (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Benson et al., 2007</xref>) public databases. A 97% similarity threshold was used as a molecular species criterion and 90% similarity threshold as a molecular genus criterion (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Nilsson et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Vu et al., 2019</xref>). The sequences were deposited in GenBank (accession numbers: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="MT908274" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">MT908274</ext-link>â€“
