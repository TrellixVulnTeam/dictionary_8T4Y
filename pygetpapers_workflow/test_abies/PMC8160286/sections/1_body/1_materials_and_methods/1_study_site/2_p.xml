<p>Following this disturbance event, permanent research sites with different management regimes were established in 2005, and each research site is about 100 ha wide (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Fleischer, 2008</xref>). Within the current research, we studied two treatments: (i) site with traditional management (EXT), where fallen trees were extracted and the locality was consequently reforested, and (ii) a site without management (NEX) left for natural succession, in which fallen trees were left. Ten circular plots (
 <italic>d</italic> = 12.6 m and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 125 m
 <sup>2</sup>) per treatment were selected so that there were at least two individuals of each tree species of interest, Norway spruce, European larch, and silver birch (
 <italic>Betula pendula</italic>), and the presence of other ECM tree species was avoided to minimize influencing the ECM fungal community.
