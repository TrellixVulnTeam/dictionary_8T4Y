<p>The research plots are situated in the Tatra Mts. (Slovakia) in the Tatra National Park (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). This area was affected by severe windstorm in 2004 during which about 12,000 ha of forest was destroyed. The area was originally covered by a Norway spruce (
 <italic>Picea abies</italic>) forest with an admixture of European larch (
 <italic>Larix decidua</italic>), and Scotch pine (
 <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic>). Currently, this area is dominated by young trees of Norway spruce, birches (
 <italic>Betula</italic> sp.), European larch, and European rowan (
 <italic>Sorbus aucuparia</italic>) in variable proportions depending on the microhabitat conditions. Locally, Scots pine, goat willow (
 <italic>Salix caprea</italic>), and silver fir (
 <italic>Abies alba</italic>) are present. The area is characterized by a cold climate and has a mean annual temperature of 5.3°C and a mean annual precipitation of 833 mm (
