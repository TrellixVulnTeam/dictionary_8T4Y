<p>The height and perimeter of each selected tree were measured (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). For each root sample, its depth, soil horizon, distance from the tree stem, and direction to other tree species were recorded (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In total, 60 root samples from each tree species per treatment (2 trees × 3 root samples per plot × 10 plots) were sampled, with the exception of Norway spruce (due to the misidentification of one of the root samples, only 59 samples were analyzed).
