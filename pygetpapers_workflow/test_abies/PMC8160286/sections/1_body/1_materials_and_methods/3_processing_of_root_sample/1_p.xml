<p>Each root sample was carefully washed under tap water, and all attached soil particles were removed using tweezers in a Petri dish with water. The root samples were examined under a stereomicroscope and documented (Canon 1,000D, Tokyo, Japan). The ECM root tips of each root sample were sorted into morphotypes according to their morphological features: color, presence of emanating hyphae and rhizomorphs, cystidia, and ramification (
