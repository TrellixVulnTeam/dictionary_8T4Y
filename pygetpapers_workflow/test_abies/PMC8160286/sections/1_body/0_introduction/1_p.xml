<p>Windstorms represent one of the major factors influencing European temperate forests (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et al., 2013</xref>), and their intensity has been increasing during the last few decades (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Gregow et al., 2017</xref>). Depending on wind severity, the influence of windstorms may extend from single trees to large areas of forests. Large windstorms, causing forest breakdown, affect the forest ecosystem in a complex way. Changes in forest structure lead to overall changes in microhabitat conditions, such as increased solar radiation connected to increased temperatures and changes in water availability (
