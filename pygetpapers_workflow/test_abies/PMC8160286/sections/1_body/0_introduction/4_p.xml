<p>Each individual tree can be associated with many ECM fungal species (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bahram et al., 2011</xref>), and each ECM fungal species differs in its specificity (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Molina and Horton, 2015</xref>). ECM fungi with narrow host range (e.g., some 
 <italic>Leccinum</italic>, 
 <italic>Rhizopogon</italic>, and 
 <italic>Suillus</italic> species) are usually restricted to a specific host genus, while ECM fungi with a broad host range (e.g., 
 <italic>Boletus</italic>, 
 <italic>Paxillus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Laccaria</italic> species) are known to be associated with nearly every tree species that form ectomycorrhizae (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Molina et al., 1992</xref>). ECM fungi with broad host ranges dominate in ECM fungal communities (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Molina et al., 1992</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Horton and Bruns, 1998</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Taudiere et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">van der Linde et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Defrenne et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Rog et al., 2020</xref>). These fungi can interconnect different tree species and influence nutrient exchange among them (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Simard et al., 1997</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">van der Heiden and Horton, 2009</xref>). On the other hand, almost all host tree species harbor in their symbiotic fungal assembly genus-restricted ECM fungi, which provide them exclusive access to resources (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Molina et al., 1992</xref>). Nevertheless, ECM fungi with a broad host range may also show host preference depending on the ecological context (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2011</xref>), while genus-restricted ECM fungi may expand their host range in the absence of their primary host (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Lofgren et al., 2018</xref>).
