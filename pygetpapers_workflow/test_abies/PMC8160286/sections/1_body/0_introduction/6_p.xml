<p>Severe windstorm damaged approximately 12,000 ha of mountain spruce forest in the Tatra Mts. (Slovakia) in 2004 (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Fleischer, 2008</xref>). In most of the affected area, the fallen trees were extracted (EXT), while a small part was left for natural succession (NEX). To bring new perspectives to the discussion on the suitability of subsequent management, we were interested in how the windstorm and following timber harvest affected the ECM fungal community and its potential to form mycorrhizal networks among regenerating tree species, Norway spruce, European larch, and silver birch. We hypothesized that ECM fungi with a broad host range will prevail in plots with traditional management (e.g., fallen tree extraction) and that different tree species will therefore share a high percentage of ECM fungal species. On the other hand, plots left for natural succession will harbor more ECM fungi with narrow host range associated with target tree species, with fewer ECM fungal species shared among them. We also hypothesized that the number of ECM fungal species would decrease in managed plots due to soil compaction and mechanical damage to seedlings that survive and the ECM fungal extramatrical mycelium.
