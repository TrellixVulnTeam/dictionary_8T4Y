<p>The ability to succeed in young forest stages depends on various functional traits of the ECM fungal species, i.e., on their enzymatic activity, which enables them to decompose various substrates and mobilize nutrients (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Velmala et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Haas et al., 2018</xref>); spore traits which improve their resistance in soil (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2003</xref>); and morphology of mycorrhizas represented by exploration type which influences nutrient exploitation from soil and interconnection of trees through the mycorrhizal network (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Agerer, 2001</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Rosinger et al., 2018</xref>). For example, some 
 <italic>Piloderma</italic> species secrete hemicellulases and hydrolytic enzymes involved in litter degradation, while 
 <italic>Wilcoxina</italic> sp. is effective in degrading chitin (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Velmala et al., 2014</xref>). Higher nitrate uptake and retranslocation to the plant host was also observed in 
 <italic>Laccaria laccata</italic> compared with 
 <italic>Suillus bovinus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Hobbie et al., 2008</xref>). The ascomycete species 
 <italic>Cenococcum geophilum</italic> is supposed to be low carbon demanding due to having a thin mantel and short-distance exploration type (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Guignabert et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Defrenne et al., 2019</xref>), while long-distance explorers belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Rhizopogon</italic> were found to dominate in dry, nutrient-poor areas, since they are able to transport resources from longer distances (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bakker et al., 2006</xref>).
