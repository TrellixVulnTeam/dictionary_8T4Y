<p>The ECM fungal community is a dynamic system interconnecting trees of the same species, but also different tree species through the mycorrhizal network (

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Rog et al., 2020</xref>). This phenomenon is not negligible when considering that up to approximately 40% of fine-root carbon can originate from mycorrhizal network exchange (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al., 2016</xref>). Not only carbon can be transferred through the mycorrhizal network, but also water and other nutrients, or signaling molecules (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Gorzelak et al., 2015</xref>). The mycorrhizal network is influenced by tree physiology, e.g., photosynthetic and growth rates, nutrient content, forest age, or infestation (

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Defrenne et al., 2019</xref>); and also by the ECM fungi themselves which protect their carbon donors (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2015</xref>). This system is expected to be very dynamic and vulnerable to large disturbances, as demonstrated by 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Pec et al. (2020)</xref>.
