<p>Fourteen ECM taxa were found in all tree species, five species were detected in Norway spruce and European larch, seven in Norway spruce and silver birch, five in European larch and silver birch, and eight were unique to Norway spruce, 10 to European larch, and 14 to silver birch. When comparing the numbers of ECM fungal species in single tree species between the NEX and EXT treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), only Norway spruce had a lower number of ECM fungal species in EXT (six species) compared with NEX (11 species). When focusing on the potential mycorrhizal networking among trees in individual plots, we found no significant differences between NEX and EXT in the numbers of ECM fungal species that were shared by all host trees, between individual pairs of host trees, or associated with a single host tree only.
