<p>Five ECM fungal species dominated in both treatments: 
 <italic>Cenococcum geophilum</italic>, 
 <italic>Lactarius rufus</italic>, 
 <italic>P. involutus</italic>, 
 <italic>P. olivaceum</italic>, and 
 <italic>T. terrestris</italic> (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Most of these species were detected in all tree species and together accounted for 50.1% in the NEX plots and 51.7% in the EXT plots. The potential of these species to form mycorrhizal networks differed only for the case of 
 <italic>P. involutus</italic>, which was absent in EXT on Norway spruce.
