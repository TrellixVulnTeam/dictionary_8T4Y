<p>Overall, 12 ECM species belonged to contact exploration type, 15 species to short-distance type, eight species to medium-distance smooth type, 12 species to medium-distance fringe type, and 11 species to long-distance type (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). When considering only the numbers of rhizomorph-forming ECM fungal species, i.e., medium-distance and long-distance exploration types, more ECM species shared by all tree species were found in NEX compared with EXT, but these differences were not significant (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). In case of NEX treatment, the potential networkers were

 <italic>C. croceus</italic>, 
 <italic>Paxillus involutus</italic>, 
 <italic>Piloderma olivaceum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Thelephora terrestris</italic>, and in case of EXT, the potential networkers were
