<p>Regarding the community composition of ECM fungal species based on the tree dataset, the only significant variables were tree species and management type (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The morphometric parameters of trees (height and perimeter) had no effect on the ECM fungal species composition. When the tree species were analyzed separately, only the ECM fungal species compositions of Norway spruce and European larch were affected by the management type (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A,B</xref>). In Norway spruce trees, 
 <italic>C. croceus</italic>, 
 <italic>Meliniomyces vraolstadiae</italic>, 
 <italic>P. involutus</italic>, 
 <italic>T. terrestris</italic>, and 
 <italic>T. fibrillosa</italic> were more abundant in NEX, whereas 
 <italic>A. byssoides</italic>, 
 <italic>L. rufus</italic>, and 
 <italic>T. asterophora</italic> were more abundant in EXT. In European larch trees, 
 <italic>C. bataillei</italic>, 
 <italic>L. laccata</italic>, 
 <italic>P. olivaceum</italic>, and 
 <italic>T. terrestris</italic> were more abundant in NEX and 
 <italic>Suillus</italic> spp. in EXT. The ECM fungal species composition of silver birch was not influenced by the studied variables (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). The ECM fungal species composition, based on the root sample dataset, was significantly affected by tree species, management type, and soil horizon (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).
