<p>In our study, we identified differences in composition of fungal communities associated with decomposing roots of 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> seedlings in three different forest microhabitats. To get unbiased results, we decided to study fungal communities developing on decomposing roots of decapitated spruce seedlings rather than to use common bags filled with collected root biomass (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Otsing et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Barel et al., 2019</xref>). Due to nylon mesh or other fabric surrounding the decomposing roots, the interconnectivity with soil (the source of potential root decomposers) is limited, which can bias development of the fungal communities. Even more importantly, the collection of roots for litterbags destroys the context of decomposition since the roots are taken from their place. Our approach solves the above problems, but as a trade-off, it makes determination of root mass loss practically impossible. To overcome this obstacle, we used lignin and cellulose concentrations in decomposing root tissues as a proxy of decomposition. Because less recalcitrant compounds, such as proteins, hemicelluloses, pectin, etc., are utilized first during decomposition (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Å najdr et al., 2011</xref>), we considered a significant increase in lignin and cellulose concentrations in decomposing root tissue compared to control (living spruce roots) as indicator of decomposition processes. Based on our results, it seems that significant decomposition processes of root tissue started between 2 and 4 months after the seedlings decapitation regardless of the studied microhabitat.
