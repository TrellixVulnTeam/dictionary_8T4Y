<p>Interestingly, a number of fungi, with unknown ecology indicative for different sampling times increased during the root decomposition, reached a maximum at the last sampling point. Although aboveground woody tissues in later stages of decomposition are usually colonized by brown-rot or white-rot fungi from Basidiomycota, these fungi were relatively scarce on decomposing 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> tissues here as well as in a previous study (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kohout et al., 2018</xref>). The vast majority of the fungi with unknown ecology indicative for later stages of decomposition showed taxonomic affinity to Ascomycota. Clearly, decomposing roots represent so far overlooked niche for new fungal species that may play an important role in mineralization of belowground plant litter.
