<p>Regardless of a forest microhabitat, we observed a clear shift in relative abundances of different fungal ecophysiological categories during succession of fungal communities on decomposing roots. Decapitation of the spruce seedling associated with termination of photosynthetic assimilates and other organic compound transport to root and adjacent soil resulted in a gradual decrease in relative abundance of EcMF. Although this observation corresponds to previously reported changes in fungal communities after disruption of belowground C transport induced by tree girdling (

 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Parladé et al., 2019</xref>), defoliation (

 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Štursová et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Pec et al., 2017</xref>), we can identify some interesting differences among the studies. Previously, 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Štursová et al. (2014)</xref> documented the decrease in relative abundance of EcMF in the soils of spruce forests from 41% to less than 10% during 1 year after the dieback of all mature trees following a bark beetle outbreak. Similarly, relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi declined from 55 to less than 5% 10 months after forest clearcutting (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kohout et al., 2018</xref>). On the contrary, in our experiment, the relative abundance of EcMF decreased from 65% before spruce seedlings decapitation to 40% 10 months after seedlings decapitation. Compared to the above mentioned reports, our experimental design only affected selected spruce seedlings, not mature trees. Therefore, the forest stands retained the same primary productivity and the major transport pathway of photosynthetic assimilates to mycelial network of EcMF on the study site was not disrupted. Our results indicate that the EcMF can persist on roots of decapitated seedlings longer in case that the common mycelial network is maintained by adjacent photosynthetically active host plants. The longer persistence of EcMF on decomposing fine roots may slow the decomposition processes as previously indicated by 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Langley et al. (2006)</xref>. If the persisting EcMF suppress the rate of root decomposition by competition for the substrate with saprotrophs (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Fernandez and Kennedy, 2016</xref>) or utilize some of the less recalcitrant compounds of decomposing plant tissue remains an open question.
