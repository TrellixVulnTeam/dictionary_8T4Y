<p>To determine natural temporal changes of composition of fungal communities, we also sampled living spruce seedlings besides the decapitated ones during each sampling time. Sampling of these control plants revealed no effect of the sampling time on the fungal communities. Previous research conducted on the same sampling site (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Žifčáková et al., 2016</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) also documented no significant change in fungal community composition among seasons, although the seasonal transcriptional activity differed among taxa.
