<p>As previously documented (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kohout et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Gray and Kernaghan, 2019</xref>), the proportion of endophytic fungi in decaying spruce seedling roots increased. These communities were dominated by endophytic 
 <italic>Meliniomyces</italic> spp. previously reported as common co-colonizers of spruce ectomycorrhizas (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Vohník et al., 2013</xref>). Besides the endophytes, some ErMF also increased their relative abundance in decaying roots. Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi may also act as endophytic colonizers of roots of non-ericoid plants (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chambers et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Kohout et al., 2013</xref>) and compared to EcMF, they generally feature greater enzymatic capabilities involved in decay of lignin and cellulose (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Vohník et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Martino et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that besides endophytic fungi, ErMF play a role in decomposition of spruce roots.
