<p>On the contrary, fungal communities on decaying spruce roots were more strongly structured by microhabitats, compared to fungal communities associated with living spruce roots. Effect of environmental conditions on decomposition rate as well as composition of fungal communities was previously documented for aboveground plant litter (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Asplund et al., 2018</xref>) and fungal necromass (

Although our experimental approach did not allow us to determine root mass loss during the decomposition, we found substantial differences in composition of fungal communities associated with decaying roots among the studied microhabitats.
