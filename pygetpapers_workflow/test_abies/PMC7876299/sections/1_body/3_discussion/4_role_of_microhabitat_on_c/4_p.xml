<p>As hypothesized, we identified saprotrophic fungi, namely, 
 <italic>Mycena</italic> sp., to be indicative for spruce roots decomposing on CWD, although the relative increase of 
 <italic>Mycena</italic> sp. during the sampling time was observed in other microhabitats as well. Similarly, significantly greater relative abundance of saprotrophic fungi was recently documented on fungal necromass decomposing in course woody debris microhabitat than in bare forest soil (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Maillard et al., 2020</xref>). 
 <italic>Mycena</italic> spp. are known to be white-rot decomposers and they were also previously identified as dominant component of fungal communities in later stages of decomposing roots (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kohout et al., 2018</xref>) or deadwood (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Baldrian et al., 2016</xref>). Considering that 
 <italic>Mycena</italic> spp. possess greater enzymatic capabilities to degrade components of plant cell wall such as cellulose or lignin compared to EcMF or endophytic fungi (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Miyauchi et al., 2020</xref>), our results indicate that its higher relative abundance in CWD microhabitat can stimulate decomposition of the root biomass.
