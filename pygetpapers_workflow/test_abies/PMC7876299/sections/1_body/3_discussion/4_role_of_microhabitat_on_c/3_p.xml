<p>Although relative abundance of endophytic fungi in decaying roots increased across all studied microhabitats, we found a clear niche partitioning between 
 <italic>P. fortinii</italic> s. l. and 
 <italic>A. applanata</italic>, the two most well-known dark septate endophytes (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Grünig et al., 2008</xref>). While 
 <italic>P. fortinii</italic> s. l. associated preferentially with decomposing spruce seedling roots in the ericoid shrub context, 
 <italic>A. applanata</italic> was almost completely missing in this microhabitat while it dominated on decomposing spruce roots in other two microhabitats. 
 <italic>A. applanata</italic> was previously almost exclusively isolated from 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> roots, whereas 
 <italic>P. fortinii</italic> s. l. showed preference for roots of ericoid plants, but occurred also on spruce roots (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Grünig et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, ericoid plants may act as refuge for 
 <italic>P. fortinii</italic> s. l. which may preferentially colonize roots spruce roots compare to 
 <italic>A. applanata</italic>.
