<p>Although forest microhabitats differ in their biotic and abiotic conditions (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">St Hilaire and Leopold, 1995</xref>) and distinct EcMF communities were documented for the same host from different microhabitats (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Iwa≈Ñski and Rudawska, 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Tedersoo et al., 2008</xref>), we found only small differences of fungal communities associated with living spruce seedling roots among microhabitats in a temperate mountainous spruce forest. Similarly, little effect of different microhabitats on EcMF communities was documented in high elevation spruce forest (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Walker and Jones, 2013</xref>). Lack of the microhabitat effect on the composition of root associated fungal communities indicates that the spruce seedlings may tend to actively select similar fungal consortia in different forest microhabitats under some circumstances.
