<p>To conclude, our results indicate that the ectomycorrhizal fungi can persist on decaying roots of spruce seedlings longer in case that the common mycelial network is maintained by adjacent photosynthetically active host plants. We also identified stronger effect of forest microhabitat on structuring fungal communities associated with decaying compare to living roots of spruce seedlings. The difference was particularly expressed in endophytic fungi. Some ericoid mycorrhizal fungi showed higher relative abundance on decaying roots in soils under ericoid shrub cover, while saprotrophic fungi had higher relative abundance in roots decomposing inside deadwood.</p>
