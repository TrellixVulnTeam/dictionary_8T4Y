<p>Since we were interested in only trend-indicative values of cellulose concentration during the decomposition process, we used a spectrophotometrical method of determination of lignin and cellulose concentrations. The method was primarily derived for lignin determination (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Lange et al., 1995</xref>) and in this method, cellulose content can be then determined from the same samples as lignin after repeated washing of the pellets after lignin extractions (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Loader et al., 1997</xref>), what makes the method quite inexpensive though less precise for determination of absolute values. Thus, it should be mentioned that while the values of the lignin concentrations were found to be comparable with other studies, e.g., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hobbie et al. (2010)</xref>, the values of cellulose concentrations in our study were found to be lower (only 20% of dry mass) and should be regarded as only trend-indicative values for comparison among treatments in the present study.
