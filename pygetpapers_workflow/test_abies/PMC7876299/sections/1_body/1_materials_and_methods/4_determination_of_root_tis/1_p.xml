<p>Part of the dried fine spruce roots was milled and subjected to determination of cellulose and lignin contents. Root lignin and cellulose contents were determined after milling and homogenizing dry root mass. Root lignin content was assessed from a 0.03 g root dry mass sample by thioglycolate solubilization (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Lange et al., 1995</xref>) and then determined spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 280 nm using hydrolytic lignin (Aldrich Chemical Company, United States) as a standard. Root cellulose content was analyzed based on 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Loader et al. (1997)</xref> from pellets after lignin extraction, which was repeatedly washed with 17% NaOH, dried and related to original dry weight, thus, the values are informative for comparison of different treatments.
