<p>Study was conducted in a 1-ha, &gt;100-years-old unmanaged spruce forest stand in the Bohemian Forest National Park, Czechia (longitude 49.0426N, latitude 13.618E; 1,190 m a.s.l.). Besides dominating spruce, only a few isolated 
 <italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic> and 
 <italic>Sorbus aucuparia</italic> trees occur in the study area. Forest floor was mostly covered with dense patches of shrubby vegetation comprised mostly by 
 <italic>Vaccinium myrtillus</italic> and few bushes of 
 <italic>V. vitis-idaea</italic>. Understory vegetation also included numerous naturally regenerating spruce seedling and several graminoid species (such as 
 <italic>Avenella flexuosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Deschampsia cespitosa</italic>). Besides the understory vegetation, the forest floor also included decomposing spruce logs. Naturally regenerating spruce seedlings were mostly observed on brown-rotten spruce logs of decay classes IV and V (based on 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Renvall, 1995</xref>). Therefore, forest floor was comprised of mosaic of different microhabitats, where spruce seedlings were regenerating.
