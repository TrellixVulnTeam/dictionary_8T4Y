<p>The fungal communities associated with roots of living (control) 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> seedlings were dominated by EcMF (62%), followed by saprotrophs (15%), ErMF (8%), and root endophytes (7%). Composition of fungal ecophysiological categories on roots of control plants was not significantly changing with time or among the studied microhabitats (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, we consider seasonality to have a minor effect on the composition of fungal ecophysiological categories of spruces seedlings on our study site. On the contrary, time after decapitation had strongly significant effect on relative abundance of fungal ecophysiological categories on spruce decaying roots (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The first significant difference in relative abundance of fungal ecophysiological categories between decaying roots and living roots was observed 10 months after the decapitation in all studied microhabitats (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Subsequently, the proportions of fungal ecophysiological categories on decomposing roots changed gradually during succession. In general, we observed decline in relative abundance of EcMF, while root endophytes and ErMF tended to increase. Fifteen months after the decapitation, the decomposing roots of 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> seedlings contained mostly sequences of endophytes (32%), followed by saprotrophs (20%), EcMF (18%), and ErMF (17%). Composition of fungal ecophysiological categories on decaying spruce roots was not significantly affected by microhabitat.
