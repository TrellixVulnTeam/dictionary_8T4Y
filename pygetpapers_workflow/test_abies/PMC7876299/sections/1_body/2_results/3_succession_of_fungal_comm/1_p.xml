<p>The fungal communities associated with roots of control 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> seedlings were dominated by EcMF genera 
 <italic>Tylospora</italic> (22% of fungal sequences), 
 <italic>Piloderma</italic> (19%), and endophytic 
 <italic>Meliniomyces</italic> spp. (12%). Surprisingly, we did not observe any effect of time on composition of fungal communities associated with control plants what indicates a negligible seasonality of fungal communities at our study site (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, we assume that all shifts in composition of fungal communities on decomposing spruce roots are associated with seedlings decapitation. Indeed, the time after decapitation structured fungal communities developing on the decomposing spruce roots (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The significant shift in fungal community composition was observed 10â€“15 months after the spruce seedlings decapitation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Indicative species analysis identified several OTUs of ErMF more frequently occurring on spruce roots after the spruce seedlings decapitation. Interestingly, we also observed a positive relationship between time after decapitation and number of indicative fungal taxa with endophytic and unknown ecologies (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). OTUs with high affinity to the Ascomycota phylum prevailed among the indicative fungi with unknown ecology.
