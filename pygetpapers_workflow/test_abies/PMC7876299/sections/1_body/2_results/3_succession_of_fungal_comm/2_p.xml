<p>Contrary to time effect, we detected significant effect of microhabitat on composition of fungal communities associated with control plants. However, the effect of microhabitat was more significant and explained two times more variability of fungal communities associated with decomposing spruce seedling roots compared to the control plants (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). We did not identified significant effect of microhabitat Ã— sampling time interaction on composition of root associated fungal communities. 
 <italic>Post hoc</italic> comparison test identified significant differences in composition of fungal communities among all studied forest microhabitats. Numerous fungal OTUs associated with decomposing spruce roots showed significant affinity to one or two of the studied microhabitats (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Saprotrophic fungi such as 
 <italic>Mycena</italic> sp. (OTU1377; SH1542291.08FU), 
 <italic>Chalara</italic> sp. (OTU5132; SH1522496.08FU), and 
 <italic>Gyoerffyella</italic> sp. (OTU5036; SH1509517.08FU) were predominantly found on spruce roots decomposing on CWD, particularly in early stages of the decomposition process. On the contrary, fungi with endophytic life strategy were more frequent on decomposing spruce roots in the ericoid shrubs. Interestingly, we identified clear segregation of two closely related endophytic fungi 
 <italic>Phialocephala</italic> sp. (OTU374; SH1647307.08FU) and 
 <italic>Acephala</italic> sp. (OTU551; SH2102217.08FU), also known as dark septate endophytes (DSE), among the studied microhabitats. While 
 <italic>Phialocephala</italic> sp. dominated on decomposing spruce roots in ericoid shrubs, 
 <italic>Acephala</italic> sp. was predominantly found in the other two microhabitats.
