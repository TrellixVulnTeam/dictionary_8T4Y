<p>Spruce seedling decapitation was associated with shifts in cellulose and lignin concentrations in root biomass. We observed significant increase in cellulose and lignin concentrations in decomposing spruce roots 4 months after the decapitation in all studied microhabitats. While cellulose concentration remained unchanged after the first significant increase, the lignin concentration in decomposing roots was gradually increasing during the whole experiment (

Consistent effect of sampling time on lignin and cellulose concentrations was not observed in control samples (
