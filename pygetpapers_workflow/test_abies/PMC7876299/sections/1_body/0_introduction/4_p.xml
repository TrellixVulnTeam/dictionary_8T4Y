<p>Current research on decomposition of litter largely focuses on the aboveground component of plants and much less attention is paid to the root litter decomposition, partly because of the technical challenges (

Because of a lower nutrient concentration and higher content of less degradable structural polymers, such as lignin, roots are considered to be more recalcitrant than aboveground litter and this might have an effect on their degradability by microorganisms (
