<p>The main aim of our study was to compare the development of root-associated fungal communities during the decomposition of roots of 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> seedlings in three different forest microhabitats within a 
 <italic>P. abies</italic>-dominated temperate forest: (i) bare forest soil, (ii) soil covered with ericoid shrubs (
 <italic>Vaccinium myrtillus</italic>), and (iii) coarse woody debris of 
 <italic>P. abies</italic>. Considering that many fungal species that act in early phases of root decomposition possess endophytic or ericoid mycorrhizal lifestyle (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kohout et al., 2018</xref>), we hypothesized that the spruce roots decomposing in ericoid shrubs will harbor fungal communities enriched by ErMF. Besides that, we also expected that fungal communities associated with decomposing spruce roots in CWD microhabitats will contain a relatively higher amount of wood decomposing, saprotrophic fungi.
