<p>Soil organic matter (SOM) represents an important pool of carbon and nutrients. Globally, SOM contains more than three times as much carbon as either the atmosphere or terrestrial vegetation (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et al., 2011</xref>). SOM is created during accumulation and decomposition of wood and leaf litter on the soil surface and root litter within soil, as well as during translocation of currently photosynthesized organic compounds belowground by living plants (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Litton et al., 2007</xref>). Large part of the belowground translocated carbon (C) enables to establish and maintain the root microbiome, which largely affects the physiology of the host plant. Belowground litter derived from roots and root-associated microorganisms has been shown as a principal source of SOM in ecosystems dominated by coniferous forests with understory vegetation dominated by ericoid dwarf shrubs (
