<p>Compared to decomposing leaf litter, where fungal communities undergo rapid succession with dramatic changes in the composition and often early decomposing taxa are completely replaced by late decomposers (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kohout et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, composition of the fungal communities associated with living tree roots can subsequently affect succession of fungal communities on root necromass as well as root decomposition processes themselves. During early stages of the decomposition, a colonization priority effect can provide a competitive advantage to root endophytes or ErMF (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kohout et al., 2018</xref>), despite possessing lower copy numbers of genes encoding lignocellulose degrading enzymes than saprotrophic lignocellulose-decomposing fungi (
