<p>Besides mycorrhizal fungi, tree roots harbor diverse communities of endophytic fungi (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Jumpponen and Trappe, 1998</xref>). Compared to mycorrhizal fungi, the effect of fungal endophytes on host plant physiology is less clear and may range from positive to negative (

 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Reininger et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Lukešová et al., 2015</xref>). Endophytic lifestyle is known among fungi from most of the fungal phyla. The endophytic communities associated with roots of trees in temperate and boreal regions are mainly dominated by the so-called dark septate endophytes (DSE) from

 <italic>Acephala applanata</italic> complex (

 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Vohník et al., 2013</xref>), which primarily form mycorrhizal association with ericoid dwarf shrubs, such as 
 <italic>Vaccinium myrtillus</italic>, commonly occurring on the forest floor (
