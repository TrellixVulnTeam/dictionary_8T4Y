<p>The tree root microbiome is comprised of a variety of mutualistic, endophytic, and parasitic microorganisms. Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EcMF) are recognized as one of the most important ecological groups. Although saprotrophic capabilities of the EcMF significantly decreased during their evolution (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Kohler et al., 2015</xref>), some of them still produce enzymes, which might have the potential to decompose nutrient-rich and carbon-rich biopolymers, such as celluloses, hemicelluloses, lignin, etc. (
