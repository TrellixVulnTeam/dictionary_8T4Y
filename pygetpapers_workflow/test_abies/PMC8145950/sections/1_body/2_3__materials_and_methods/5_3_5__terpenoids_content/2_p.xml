<p>The extracts were directly injected into the GC and helium (He) was used as a carrier gas. The identification process consisted in the comparison of the peak retention times from the standard solution chromatogram with the retention times of the peaks registered on the tested extracts chromatograms. The identified compounds were quantified based on their peak height. The detailed analysis protocol was previously described [
