<p>In order to identify and quantify the potential volatile compounds present in the bark extracts, gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) was used. A GC with a TG-WAXMS capillary column, coupled with a FID detector was used for this procedure. The linearity interval was determined using five calibration solutions prepared in duplicates. For the calculation of the concentrations, the densities of the compounds were taken into account and a series of five dilutions was prepared from a stock solution of terpenes. The concentrations of the solutions in the calibration curves were ranged as follows: for C
 <sub>α-pinene, β-pinene</sub> = 23.55–1177.5 mg/L, for C
 <sub>camphene</sub> = 11.85–150.3 mg/L, for C
 <sub>3-carene</sub> = 12.25–148 mg/L, for C
 <sub>α-phellandrene</sub> = 0.5–10 mg/L, for C
 <sub>limonene</sub> = 20–150.6 mg/L, for C
 <sub>sabinene</sub> =5–50 mg/L, for C
 <sub>myrcene</sub> = 24.27–485.4 mg/L, for C
 <sub>tricyclene</sub> = 5.15–122.1 mg/L, respectively. If the signals given by some samples were out of linearity interval, the samples were diluted in order to fit within linearity range of the method. The precision was determined as relative standard deviation (% RSD) calculated for the three repeated measurements for the upper limit concentrations of the calibration curve (i.e., C
 <sub>α-pinene, β-pinene</sub> = 1177.5 mg/L, C
 <sub>camphene</sub> = 150.3 mg/L, C
 <sub>3-carene</sub> = 148 mg/L, C
 <sub>α-phellandrene</sub> = 10 mg/L, C
 <sub>limonene</sub> = 150.6 mg/L, C
 <sub>sabinene</sub> = 50 mg/L, C
 <sub>myrcene</sub> = 485.4 mg/L, C
 <sub>tricyclene</sub> = 122.1 mg/L).
