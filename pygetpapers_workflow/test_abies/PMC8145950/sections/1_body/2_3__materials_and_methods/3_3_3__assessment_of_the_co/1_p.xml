<p>For assessing the TPC, the Folin–Ciocâlteu method was used [

 <xref rid="B61-plants-10-00870" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Briefly, 40 µL of diluted (1:5) extract were brought together in a vial with distilled water, Folin–Ciocâlteu reagent and a 20% Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> solution. This mixture was then kept at room temperature for 30 min. Finally, the absorbance was spectrophotometrically measured at a wavelength of 765 nm. For every experimental variant six measurements were performed. A calibration curve was used to express the TPC as gallic acid equivalents per gram of vegetal matrix (mg GAE/g vegetal matrix).
