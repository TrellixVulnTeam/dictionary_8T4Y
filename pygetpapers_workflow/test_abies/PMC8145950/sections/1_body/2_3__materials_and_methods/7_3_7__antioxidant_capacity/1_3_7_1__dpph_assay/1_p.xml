<p>The AC was assessed using the DPPH method [
 <xref rid="B68-plants-10-00870" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. A 50-fold dilution was applied before the assay for each experimental variant. The diluted extracts were then treated with a DPPH solution and after 30 min the absorbance was spectrophotometrically measured at 517 nm. The exact method was previously described [
