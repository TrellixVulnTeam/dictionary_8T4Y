<p>For the TTC determination of the tested extracts, a method utilized for the determination of tannins in herbal drugs was used [
 <xref rid="B67-plants-10-00870" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. This method uses the Folin–Ciocâlteu assay to assess the TPC of the extracts spectrophotometrically, before and after treatment with hide powder. This procedure uses the property of tannins to get adsorbed by the hide powder, thus the difference in absorbance recorded for the tested samples before and after treatment with hide powder, indirectly represents the absorbance of the tannins adsorbed. The tannins absorbance was translated into TTC expressed as mg pyrogallol/g vegetal material by using pyrogallol as an external standard. The exact work protocol was previously described [
