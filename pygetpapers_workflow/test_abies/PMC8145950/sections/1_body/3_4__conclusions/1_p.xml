<p>The results of this study indicated that differences occur between the barks collected from different locations and between the extracts obtained by different methods, regarding the phytochemical composition, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities. It has been shown that the UAE is more efficient for extracting phenolic compounds and tannins (excepting the case of the M1 variants), while the MAE generally resulted in higher yields of terpenoids (mainly α-pinene and β-pinene). Minor differences were registered between the collecting sites of the barks; however, these differences were not significant.</p>
