<p>Therefore, this study focused on the evaluation of the phytochemical profile and biological effects of the extracts attained by different extraction methods and from 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> barks collected in different locations. A comparison between the two extraction methods and between the different collecting sites was performed. For the chemical composition assessment, the Folin–Ciocâlteu method was performed to measure the levels of polyphenols and tannins, while UPLC-PDA and GC-FID methods were performed to identify the main phenolic compounds and volatile terpenoids, respectively. As for the biological activity, the antioxidant capacity (AC) and antibacterial activity were assessed by the DPPH and ABTS assays and by the microdilution assay, respectively.
