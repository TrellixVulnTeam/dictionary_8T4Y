<p>The inhibition percentages registered for the ABTS assay indicate the AC corresponding to 1.25 mg spruce bark and 0.17 mg ABTS reagent per tested sample. These results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00870-f002">Figure 2</xref>b, showing that the extracts obtained by UAE have a superior AC compared to their MAE counterparts. Although between M1 M and M1 US, and M2 M and M2 US no significant difference occurred by comparing their AC resulted after the ABTS assay, the differences between the MT M and MT US, and MD M and MD US are significantly different, indicating a similar trend as in the results of the previously performed antioxidant activity assay. Moreover, like in the previous assay, the variants that had higher polyphenol contents have led to a superior AC, the Pearson test indicating even a stronger correlation between the TPC and the inhibition percentages resulted in the ABTS assay (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.8484), as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00870-f003">Figure 3</xref>b.
