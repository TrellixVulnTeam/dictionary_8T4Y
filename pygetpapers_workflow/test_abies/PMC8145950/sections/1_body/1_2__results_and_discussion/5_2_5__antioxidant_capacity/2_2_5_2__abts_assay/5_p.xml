<p>As previously stated our results suggested a positive correlation between the TPC and AC of the tested extracts, however other studies that analyzed the relation between the two variables found no significant correlation [

The discrepancy between our results and the data found in literature might be due to the different methodologies used for extraction, or even because the vegetal matrices used in the baseline studies were not barks. For example, in one of our previous works conducted on pine bark, it was also shown that the UAE is more efficient for extracting polyphenols and for achieving extracts with higher antioxidant capacities [
