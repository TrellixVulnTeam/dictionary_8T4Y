<p>It was shown that the extracts attained by UAE exhibit higher ACs compared to their MAE counterparts. The M2 US variant had the highest AC (52.64% Â± 2.35%) between all extracts obtained by UAE, however the differences were not statistically significant. However, when compared to MAE variants, M2 US had a significantly higher AC. M1 M was the only MAE variant that had a comparable AC with the UAE variants, these results indicating a correlation between the AC and TPC. This correlation is further reinforced by the fact that MT US and MD US had significantly higher Acs than their MAE counterparts, but also significantly higher TPC values, suggesting that higher polyphenolic content may lead to a stronger antioxidant activity. The results of the Pearson test presented in

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.8006).
