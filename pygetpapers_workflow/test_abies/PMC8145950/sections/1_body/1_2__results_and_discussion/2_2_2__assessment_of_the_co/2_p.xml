<p>Coșarcă S.L. et al. quantified the tannin content of their aqueous spruce bark extracts attained by UAE and achieved a concentration of 11.4 mg pyrogallol/g, thus indicating a lower level of TTC compared to our experimental variants [

Although the methods used in this baseline study were similar to the methods used in the present study, the difference in the extraction time, temperature and solvent might be the reason for the disparity of the results. Data about the tannin content of spruce bark extracts attained by MAE could not be found in the literature.
