<p>The results regarding the TTC are represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00870-f001">Figure 1</xref>b, as mg pyrogallol per g of vegetal material. It has been noticed that the highest TTC was recorded for the M1 M variant (19.34 ± 4.88 mg/g); however, no significant difference occurred between the experimental variants except MT M, for which a significantly lower level of tannins (7.56 ± 0.65 mg/g) was identified. Although almost no significant differences were registered after comparing the extracts, the results showed that slightly higher TTCs were associated with the extracts obtained by UAE, except the M1 variants, for which, the MAE seemed to lead to a slightly higher tannin yield, but the difference was not significant. As in the case of TPC, minor differences occurred between the collecting sites, but these differences were not significant.
