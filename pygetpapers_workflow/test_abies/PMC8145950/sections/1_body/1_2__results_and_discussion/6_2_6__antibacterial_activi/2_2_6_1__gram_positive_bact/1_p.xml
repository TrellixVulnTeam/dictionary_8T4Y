<p>As it can be observed M1 M and MD M were the most efficient variants against Gram-positive bacterial strains (
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and methicillin resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>-MRSA), having the lowest MIC (3.125 mg/mL) against both strains. The M2 US and MD US variants also had the lowest MIC value, but only against one of the two tested strains. The Gram-positive bacterial strains were inhibited by all tested variants, roughly with the same efficiency.
