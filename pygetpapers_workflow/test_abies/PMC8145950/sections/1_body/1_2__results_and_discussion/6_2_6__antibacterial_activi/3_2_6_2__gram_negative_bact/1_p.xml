<p>A modest antibacterial activity was identified against the tested Gram-negative bacterial strains (
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>). For the extracts attained by UAE all MICs were equal to, or above the concentration of the raw, undiluted extract (50 mg/mL). M1 US, MT US, and MD US exhibited antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, none of the UAE extracts were efficient against 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic>, and all of them showed antibacterial properties against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> at the highest concentration (50 mg/mL). Similarly, the extracts obtained by MAE had MICs equal or above the maximum concentration tested (100 mg/mL) as it can be seen in
