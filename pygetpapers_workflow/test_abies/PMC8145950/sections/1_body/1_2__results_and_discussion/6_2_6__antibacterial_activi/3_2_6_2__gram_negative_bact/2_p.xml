<p>In a previous study, it has been shown that aqueous spruce bark extracts obtained by classical extraction and UAE had antibacterial effects against Gram-positive bacteria, but these extracts were also efficient against 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> at an MIC of 15 mg/mL or lower [

 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus thermophilus</italic>, because of the content in catechin, taxifolin, astringin, and isorhapontin [

These results suggest that our spruce bark extracts may exhibit this antibacterial activity because of the catechins present in the natural extracts, as other studies have also shown the antibacterial properties of these compounds against bacterial strains such as 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
