<p>Other studies regarding the TPC of spruce bark extracts attained by UAE achieved similar results. For example a study that used almost identical parameters for the UAE of the 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> bark, identified a TPC of around 40 mg GAE/g, indicating the similarity of the results [

 <italic>P. abies</italic> bark, achieved a TPC of the extracts of 28.73 ± 0.08 mg GAE/g, thus recording a lower level of phenolic compounds compared to most of our experimental variants. However, in this baseline study an aqueous extraction was performed and not a hydro-alcoholic one, using a higher extraction temperature (70 °C) and a lower extraction time (15 min) compared to our extraction parameters [
