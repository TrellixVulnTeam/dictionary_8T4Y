<p>As it can be observed, the MD US variant had the highest TPC (43.64 ± 10.52 mg/g), but the content was significantly higher only when compared to MT M and MD M. The lowest TPC was recorded for the MT M variant (19.54 ± 1.79 mg/g), having significantly lower levels of phenolic compounds in comparison to the other variants excepting MD M. It can be also noted that the extracts attained via UAE are associated with higher TPC. Every variant obtained using this extraction method had higher TPC than the variants obtained by MAE, however the only significant differences occurred between the MT (US and M) and MD (US and M) experimental variants. Although slight differences occurred between the different collecting sites, there were no significant differences registered regarding the TPC.</p>
