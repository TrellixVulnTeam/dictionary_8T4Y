<p>None of the samples had detectable levels of gallic, sinapic, and vanillic acids, neither taxifolin, although previous reports suggested that these compounds are among the polyphenols found in spruce bark extracts [

Moreover, our results clearly suggest that the UAE is more efficient for the extraction of catechin and epicatechin from the spruce bark. In contrast Albuquerque et al., showed that the microwave assisted extraction is more efficient for the extraction of catechin compared to the ultrasound assisted extraction [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-10-00870" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This discrepancy may appear, because a different vegetal matrix was used in the baseline study and also a more controlled environment was used for the MAE. However, the degradation of catechin and epicatechin in our MAE variants is unlikely due to the fact that these compounds suffer modifications only at higher temperatures than those achieved by us in the MAE [
