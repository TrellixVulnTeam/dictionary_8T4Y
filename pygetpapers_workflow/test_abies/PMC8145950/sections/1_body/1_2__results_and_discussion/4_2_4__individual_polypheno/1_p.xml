<p>The major peaks occurring at retention times of 4.53 min and 5.25 min were catechin and epicatechin. The calculated contents of catechin and epicatechin are found in

For the UAE samples higher contents of catechin and epicatechin were identified, while for the MAE variants, a lower yield of these compounds was registered. Consistent with the results obtained in TPC and tannin content, M1 and MD samples contain the highest concentrations of both catechin and epicatechin, closely followed by MT samples. High catechin and epicatechin concentrations were expected, since they are the main monomers of spruce bark proanthocyanidins [
