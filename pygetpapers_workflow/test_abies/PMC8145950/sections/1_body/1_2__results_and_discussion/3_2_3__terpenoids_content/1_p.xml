<p>After the GC-FID analysis, the volatile compounds presented in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00870-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> were identified and quantified, the results being expressed as µg compound per g vegetal material. It was observed that the main terpenoids identified in the spruce bark were α-pinene and β-pinene, the M1 M variant having the significantly highest α-pinene content (2198.33 ± 0.25 µg/g), while the MD M variant had the highest β-pinene content (4312.24 ± 4.07 µg/g). As for the less abundant identified compounds, the M2 M variant had the highest content of camphene, α-phellandrene, myrcene, and tricyclene, the MT M variant contained the highest yield of 3-carene and limonene, while the MD M variant also had the highest sabinene content out of all tested extracts. The most part of the results showed that higher yields of volatile compounds were associated with the variants obtained with the MAE method, however exceptions were identified too. For example, higher levels of camphene and myrcene were measured in the MT US variant compared to MT M and 3-carene content was higher in the UAE variants compared to the MAE counterparts, excepting the MT variants. Moreover, α-phellandrene and limonene contents were higher in the M1 US and M2 US, respectively, compared to their MAE counterparts.
