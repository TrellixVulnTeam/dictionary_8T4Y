<p>In a study conducted on spruce bark extracts attained by Soxhlet and super-critical CO
 <sub>2</sub> extractions, the terpenoids were identified and quantified, but none of the compounds identified in this study corresponded to their results [

However, two other studies that focused on the emissions of volatile organic compounds from the spruce bark have indicated that high levels of α- and β-pinene were emitted from the spruce barks, but also lower quantities of limonene, 3-carene, camphene, sabinene, α-phellandrene, and tricyclene were identified [
