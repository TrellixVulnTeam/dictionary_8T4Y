  <p>Distribution of ASV sizes (sequence proportions). ASVs were categorized based on 
   <bold>(A)</bold> the number of sample groups (3 decay classes Ã— 3 DNA types) and 
   <bold>(C)</bold> the sets of DNA types (extracellular and intracellular DNA fraction, total DNA pool), in which they were detected. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Set definitions of DNA fractions, in which ASVs can be detected. These definitions are applied in panel 
   <bold>(C)</bold> and in the text.
