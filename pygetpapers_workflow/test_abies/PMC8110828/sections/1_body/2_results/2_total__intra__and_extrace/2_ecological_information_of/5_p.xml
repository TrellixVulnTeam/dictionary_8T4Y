<p>Those ASVs not observed in the intracellular DNA fraction, but detected in the extracellular DNA fraction (
 <italic>extra</italic> ASVs) and in the total DNA pool (
 <italic>tot/ex</italic> ASVs) also (i) accounted for both a high number of ASVs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) and a significant percentage of reads (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>), and (ii) were taxonomically diverse (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Across all DCls, a relatively high fraction of 
 <italic>extra</italic> and 
 <italic>tot/ex</italic> ASVs belonged to 
 <italic>Actinobacteriota</italic>. In DCl I, 
 <italic>Bacteroidota</italic> and 
 <italic>Verrucomicrobiota</italic> were frequently found in the 
 <italic>tot/ex</italic> and 
 <italic>extra</italic> ASVs. In DCl III and especially in DCl V, 
 <italic>Planctomycetota</italic> appeared frequently detected with regard to 
 <italic>tot/ex</italic> and 
 <italic>extra</italic> ASVs.
