<p>In microbiome studies, statistical tools are often used to search for indicator ASVs that are interpreted as key species for a target ecosystem. Therefore, we evaluated if the indicator ASVs identified using Aldex2 were differentially detected among the DNA types. We plotted the read proportions of the ASVs across the three DNA types obtained from one log sample. We used the read proportion of the indicator ASVs in those groups of three samples and plotted their abundance for all logs. As the ternary diagram shows, the vast majority of indicator ASV proportions across logs was located in the middle of the triangle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>), supporting that these indicator ASVs were mainly detected across all DCls and DNA types. In total, there was a number of 48 indicator ASVs. In DCl I, 26 out of 29 indicator ASVs were detected in all DNA types. In DCls III and V, the proportions were 23/29 and 28/34, respectively. Those points located on the lowest side of the triangle correspond to ASVs not being detected in the total DNA pool of a log. Moreover, within DCls, the relative abundances of these indicator ASVs differed between the DNA types (
