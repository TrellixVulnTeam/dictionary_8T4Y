<p>Considering the three DCls together with the three DNA types, we expected to detect (i) a small number of ASVs with high relative abundance in all nine sample groups and (ii) a high number of ASVs with lower relative abundance in a single or in a low number of sample groups. Concerning this latter point, we expected the majority of ASVs to be detected in â‰¤ 3 sample groups, given the big differences among DCls and the dependencies between the bacteriomes of the DNA types derived from the extracts originating from the very same log sample. In line with this, we found that ASVs with higher abundance were detected more often in a higher number of sample groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Less than 100 and less than 30 out of 624 ASVs were found in &gt;3 and &gt;6 sample groups, respectively. A total of 285 ASVs (&gt;45%) were unique to one sample group, that is one DNA type of a specific DCl. The majority of these unique ASVs were detected in the extracellular DNA fraction (extracellular: 129 ASVs; intracellular: 64 ASVs; total: 92 ASVs). A total of 126 ASVs (20% of all ASVs) and 114 ASVs (18% of all ASVs) were detected in two and three sample groups, respectively.
