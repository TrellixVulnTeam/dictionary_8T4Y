<p>From here on, we will refer to ASVs observed solely in the intracellular DNA fraction, extracellular DNA fraction or total DNA pool as 
 <italic>intra</italic>, 
 <italic>extra</italic>, and 
 <italic>total ASVs</italic>, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). ASVs observed in both DNA fractions but not in the total DNA pool will be termed 
 <italic>in/ex ASVs</italic>. Those ASVs observed in one DNA fraction and the total DNA pool will be termed 
 <italic>in/tot</italic> and 
 <italic>tot/ex</italic> ASVs, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Core ASVs will be those detected across all DNA types (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). We found that 
 <italic>in/tot</italic> and 
 <italic>tot/ex</italic> ASVs had a higher relative abundance than 
 <italic>in/ex</italic> ASVs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). In addition, the majority of ASVs which were detected in exactly two different sample groups were also found in the intra- and extracellular DNA fractions of the same DCl (74/126 ASVs). A lower number of those ASVs was found in the total and the extracellular DNA (22/126 ASVs); as well as in the total and the intracellular DNA (15/126 ASVs) of the same DCl. The remaining ASVs detected in exactly two sample groups were found across DCls (15/126 ASVs). Those ASVs detected exactly three times in our dataset were mostly observed in all DNA types of a respective DCl (98/114 ASVs), which underlines the bigger effect of the DCl compared to the DNA type. The remaining 16 ASVs were unique to one DNA fraction, mainly to intracellular DNA and were repeatedly present across the three different DCls.
