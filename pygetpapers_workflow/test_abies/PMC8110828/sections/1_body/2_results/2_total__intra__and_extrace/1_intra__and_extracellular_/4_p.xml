<p>Given the deeper level of ecological analysis reached in the extracellular vs. intracellular DNA fractions compared to the total DNA pool, we investigated the frequency of those bacterial taxa detected in only one DNA type of the same DCl in comparison to its overall distribution. Therefore, we counted the number of ASVs annotated to a certain bacterial class within each of the nine sample groups and compared the frequencies of class annotations within DCls among DNA types. For a number of bacterial classes, their frequencies differed among DNA types indicating that the taxonomic distribution of ASVs with low relative abundance did not follow the taxonomic pattern of more abundant ASVs (

 <italic>Desulfobacterota</italic> ASVs reached higher frequencies in the intracellular DNA fraction compared to the other DNA types. In this DCl, the extracellular DNA did not contain any bacterial classes with higher frequencies in comparison with the total DNA pool. In DCl V, a number of classes showed higher frequencies in the intra- and extracellular DNA fractions than in the total DNA pool. Amongst other phyla, the frequencies of 
 <italic>Acidobacteriota</italic>, 
 <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, 
 <italic>Desulfobacterota</italic>, 
 <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic>, and 
 <italic>Verrucomicrobiota</italic> were increased by at least 1.5-fold in the intracellular DNA and by at least 2-fold in the extracellular DNA fraction compared to the total DNA pool (
