<p>Microbiome analysis by high-throughput sequencing largely depends on which sequences are amplified, implying the DNA type targeted. Consequently, when analyzing the total environmental DNA pool, its proportion of intra- and extracellular DNA are decisive for the results. In our study, the concentrations of intra- and extracellular DNA were comparable within each of the three DCls (
