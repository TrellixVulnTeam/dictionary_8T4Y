<p>Considering the main effects, there were no significant differences in ASV numbers among DNA types and DCls. Among sample groups (DNA types Ã— DCl), ASV numbers differed significantly (

 <sub>Kruskal</sub> = 0.007). For both intra- and extracellular DNA fractions the highest numbers of ASVs were detected in DCls I and V, respectively (

However, these differences in the number of ASVs among the sample groups were likely related to the sequencing depth. With this in mind, we further estimated the bacterial ASV richness using breakaway (
