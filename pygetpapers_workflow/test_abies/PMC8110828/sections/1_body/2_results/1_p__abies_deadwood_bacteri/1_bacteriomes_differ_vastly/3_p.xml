<p>Only a total of seventeen ASVs were detected across the three DCls (core ASVs, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). A higher number of ASVs was unique to each DCl (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), particularly for DCl V with 77 unique ASVs. This indicates that the bacterial community of this DCl was more dissimilar compared to DCls I and III (15 and 2 unique ASVs, respectively; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1B,C</xref>). Both the core and unique ASVs were taxonomically diverse (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), and the majority of the core ASVs varied in their differential abundance when comparing the three DCls (11 out of 17 ASVs,
