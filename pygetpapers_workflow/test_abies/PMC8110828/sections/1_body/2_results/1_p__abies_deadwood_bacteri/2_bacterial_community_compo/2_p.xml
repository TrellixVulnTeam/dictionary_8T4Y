 <italic>Actinobacteriota</italic> (74 ASVs), 
 <italic>Acidobacteriota</italic> (99 ASVs), and 
 <italic>Verrucomicrobiota</italic> (71 ASVs) were detected in all sample groups (&gt;14% of all reads; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). In DCl I, the proportion of 
 <italic>Actinobacteriota</italic> reads exceeded the proportions of 
 <italic>Acidobacteriota</italic> and 
 <italic>Verrucomicrobiota</italic> reads. Within 
 <italic>Actinobacteriota</italic>, members of the order 
 <italic>Solirubrobacterales</italic> accounted for the highest number and read percentage (7% of all reads, 29 ASVs). The proportion of 
 <italic>Acidobacteriota</italic> reads increased from DCl I (14% of all reads) to DCl III (19% of all reads), where its proportion was even higher compared to 
 <italic>Actinobacteriota</italic> and 
 <italic>Verrucomicrobiota</italic>. The vast majority of 
 <italic>Acidobacteriota</italic> reads were annotated as 
 <italic>Acidobacteriales</italic> (14% of all reads, 87 ASVs). Especially 
 <italic>Granulicella</italic> was found to be more characteristic for DCls I and III. 
 <italic>Granulicella</italic> ASVs had a significantly higher relative abundance in these two DCls, peaking in DCl III, compared to DCl V (
