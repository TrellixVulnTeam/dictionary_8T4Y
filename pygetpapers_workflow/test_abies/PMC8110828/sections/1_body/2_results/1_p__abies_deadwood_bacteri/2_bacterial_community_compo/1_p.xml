<p>The majority of sequencing reads was annotated as 
 <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> (&gt;40% of all reads) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). This phylum also had the highest number of different ASVs (232 out of 623 ASVs), and was primarily comprised by the orders 
 <italic>Acetobacterales</italic> (14% of total reads; 77 ASVs), 
 <italic>Rhizobiales</italic> (8% of total reads; 36 ASVs) and 
 <italic>Burkholderiales</italic> (8% of total reads; 17 ASVs). These taxa also comprised almost all the proteobacterial ASVs unique to each of the sample groups or differentially abundant across DCls (16 out of 20 ASVs; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ST1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). 
 <italic>Acetobacteraceae</italic> were detected in a relatively high richness across all DCls (&gt;30% of all 
 <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> ASVs), especially in DCl III (12/24 ASVs). The genera 
 <italic>Acidisoma</italic>, 
 <italic>Acidisphaera</italic>, and 
 <italic>Endobacter</italic> revealed to be characteristic for this DCl (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). 
 <italic>Burkholderiaceae</italic> ASVs (such as 
 <italic>Rhizobacter</italic>) and 
 <italic>Beijerinckiaceae</italic> ASVs (such as 
 <italic>Methylorosula</italic>) were associated with DCl I (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ST1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In DCl V, ASVs with particularly high abundance or ASVs unique to this sample group appeared taxonomically more diverse. Proteobacterial ASVs characteristic for this DCl were annotated as 
 <italic>Roseiarcus</italic> (
 <italic>Beijerinckiaceae</italic>), 
 <italic>Burkholderia</italic> (
 <italic>Burkholderiaceae</italic>), and 
 <italic>Acidisphaera</italic> (
 <italic>Acetobacteraceae</italic>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ST1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, ASVs with high abundance in DCl V were often lower or not detected in DCl I and vice versa. For instance, the richness of 
 <italic>Rhizobiales</italic> was higher in DCl I (20 ASVs) compared to DCl V (14 ASVs), while a higher number of 
 <italic>Burkholderiales</italic> ASVs was found in DCl V (12 ASVs) with respect to DCl I (9 ASVs).
