<p>Despite the concerns raised regarding their conceptual differences, the DNA types studied here broadly resembled a comparable bacteriome and our results indicate that the differences in terms of composition with regard to their ecological interpretation might benefit scientific research. The analysis of the total DNA pool resulted in a robust, meaningful picture of the deadwood ecosystem. However, its resolution – independent of sequencing depth – is not as deep as the one provided by intracellular DNA, which is in agreement with 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Nagler et al. (2020)</xref> who made the same observation for slurry bioreactors. Especially if no exact time-depending compositional data are needed, the total DNA pool appears as a good choice, as it reflects the picture of the ecosystem including its former states. Studies focusing on microbial diversity or microbial populations with low-abundance might benefit from the increased sequencing depth provided by the intracellular DNA fraction. In these studies, the more complex extraction of intracellular DNA might be worth the effort. A general disadvantage of intracellular DNA analysis – equally to total DNA – by using commercial extraction kits, is the usually small amount of starting material. Studies on large and complex ecosystems – such as soil – can suffer from this, especially if they are heterogeneous and patchy. Analysis of the extracellular DNA can easily be up-scaled to larger amounts of input material and provide an efficient way of DNA extraction. However, ecosystems with high rates of microbial turnover and ecosystems underlying big disturbances or short-term successional changes might lack accuracy in terms of microbiome composition. Further studies are necessary to understand general concepts of DNA release into the extracellular environment. For evolutionary studies, it might be meaningful to analyze both DNA fractions of the environmental DNA pool. Extracellular DNA might be incorporated by living cells (natural transformation) thereby contributing to genome diversification and consequently, bacterial evolution/adaptation. Intracellular DNA can give a clear indication regarding which organisms diversify. In this context, metagenomic studies could prove especially valuable.
