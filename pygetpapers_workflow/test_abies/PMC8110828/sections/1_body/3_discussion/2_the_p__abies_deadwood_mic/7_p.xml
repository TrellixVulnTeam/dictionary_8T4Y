<p>It seems that multiple factors shape the microbiome of deadwood and determine its trajectory. Especially in terms of functional roles, more research involving the characterization, identification and description of isolates is necessary to shed light into the complex degradation process. In addition, co-cultivation experiments with wood inhabiting fungi should be performed in the future to study the interaction of deadwood inhabiting fungi and bacteria and to understand to what extent fungi shape the deadwood bacteriome.</p>
