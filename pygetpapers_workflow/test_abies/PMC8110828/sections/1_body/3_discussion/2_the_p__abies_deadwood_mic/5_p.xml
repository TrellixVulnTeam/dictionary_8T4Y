<p>In DCl V, a high number of ASVs and high read proportions were annotated to 
 <italic>Verrucomicrobiota</italic>, exceeding both 
 <italic>Actinobacteriota</italic> and 
 <italic>Acidobacteriota</italic> (

 <italic>Verrucomicrobiota</italic> are wide-spread across a range of environments, their vast majority remains uncultivated and is consequently, metabolically undescribed (

 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Wagner and Horn, 2006</xref>). As methylotrophy could provide an advantage in the deadwood environment due to fungal lignolytic activities that may result in the release of methanol, this trait might be spread across deadwood 
 <italic>Verrucomicrobiota</italic>, thereby explaining their peak abundance in DCl V and both their high ASV richness and read proportions in the set of
