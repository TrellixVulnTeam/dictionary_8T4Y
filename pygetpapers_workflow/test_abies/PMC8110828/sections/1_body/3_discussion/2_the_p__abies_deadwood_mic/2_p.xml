<p>The vast differences in bacteriome compositions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) reflected the vast ecological differences among deadwood at different decay stages. Despite the ability of some bacteria to degrade complex polymers, fungi are recognized as the main deadwood decomposers (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Eastwood et al., 2011</xref>). The bacterial and fungal compositions are, therefore, likely interconnected within the deadwood habitat. As bacteria usually feed on the metabolites released by fungal activity, fungi may inhibit bacterial growth by the acidification of their environment and/or by the production of antibiotics (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Folman et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Johnston et al., 2016</xref>). With this in mind, acidotolerant, antibiotic resistant bacteria and those beneficial for the wood-inhabiting fungi are more likely to appear in higher quantities (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). A high number of reads and a high number of ASVs were annotated as 
 <italic>Acetobacteraceae</italic> (
 <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic>). Members of this taxon usually have an optimum pH ranging between 5 and 6.5 or even lower (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Reis and dos Santos Teixeira, 2015</xref>), which might be advantageous for the fungi-dominated deadwood environment. Moreover, some members of this taxon are even able to fixate nitrogen (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Reis and dos Santos Teixeira, 2015</xref>). Genes coding for enzymes involved in N-cycling, including N-fixation, have been found wide-spread across the bacterial phylogenetic tree (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Nelson et al., 2016</xref>). Also some members of the taxa 
 <italic>Burkholderiales</italic> and 
 <italic>Rhizobiales</italic>, which were also found in high read proportions and numbers of ASVs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), have been associated to this phylogenetically unconserved trait (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Nelson et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Shamseldin et al., 2017</xref>). In fact, members of these taxa have also been associated to methylotrophy (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chistoserdova et al., 2009</xref>), potentially giving them another selective advantage, especially with regards to co-inhabiting the deadwood together with fungi. Recently, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">G贸mez-Brand贸n et al. (2020)</xref> showed that OTUs annotated as both 
 <italic>Rhizobiales</italic> and 
 <italic>Burkholderiales</italic> (
 <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic>) were associated to deadwood colonizing fungi in the very early stages of 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> decay (2 years of decomposition). In their study, associations between mycorrhizal fungi and 
 <italic>Burkholderia</italic> ASVs, which were also differentially abundant across DCls here (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), were reported. The changes in the fungal composition as a function of progressing decay (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Arnstadt et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">G贸mez-Brand贸n et al., 2020</xref>) are therefore likely to influence the bacteriome of the deadwood. In fact, this is reflected by the differences in relative abundance between DCls with regard to 
 <italic>Rhizobiales</italic>, 
 <italic>Burkholderiales</italic>, and 
 <italic>Acetobacteraceae</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The high selective pressure on bacteria in deadwood might result in a high turnover and a strong fluctuation of low-abundance populations, which is reflected by the high numbers and read proportions of ASVs that were detected in solely one DNA type (extracellular vs. intracellular fraction vs. total DNA pool) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).
