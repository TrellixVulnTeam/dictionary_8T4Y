<p>In the case of 
 <italic>Acidobacteriota</italic>, they peaked in relative abundance in DCl III. While 
 <italic>Acidobacteriota</italic> ASVs were frequently detected in 
 <italic>intra</italic> and 
 <italic>in/ex</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) and, therefore, likely reflect potentially living bacterial populations (intact cells), 
 <italic>Actinobacteriota</italic> ASVs were frequently found in 
 <italic>extra</italic> and 
 <italic>tot/ex</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>) and are, therefore, potentially not viable. This latter phylum has been reported to occur on tree stems, including those from 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cregger et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Ren et al., 2019</xref>). In our study, 
 <italic>Actinobacteriota</italic> had a high ASV richness and to a certain extent read proportion in DCl I, suggesting that they might originate from populations that colonized the living tree, even though their metabolic role in 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> deadwood degradation was probably minor owing to their pronounced presence in the extracellular DNA fraction. In fact, the capacity of some members of the 
 <italic>Acidobacteriota</italic> to grow on cellobiose and N-acetyl-glucosamine and to produce enzymes required for chitin and cellobiose degradation has previously been shown for 
 <italic>Acidobacteriota</italic> from forest soil (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Llad√≥ et al., 2016</xref>) and their adaptation to acidic conditions (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Sait et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kielak et al., 2016a</xref>) might make some 
 <italic>Acidobacteriota</italic> equally fit for DCl I and potentially more resistant to fungal competition than 
 <italic>Actinobacteriota</italic>. The roles of these two phyla, their dynamics and their interactions with fungal deadwood degraders will help in understanding deadwood ecology and warrants deeper investigation.
