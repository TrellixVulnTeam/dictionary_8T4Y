<p>The deadwood samples from Norway spruce (
 <italic>P. abies</italic> (L.) Karst) were collected in a montane forest at an altitude of 1995 m above sea level (a.s.l.) in Val di Rabbi (Trentino, Italy). A detailed description of the study site is given in 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Petrillo et al. (2015)</xref>. The samples were classified 
 <italic>in situ</italic> into DCls I, III, and V based on their visual, geometric and tactile features (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Hunter, 1990</xref>). Samples from DCl I correspond to hard wood penetrable with a knife for only a few mm. Wood of DCl III is distinctly softer and can be penetrated with a knife to around 1–4 cm. In DCl V, wood is very soft and has a crumbly, instable texture which is easily penetrable with a knife for &gt;10 cm; the shape of the original log is barely recognizable. For each DCl, three samples (biological replicates) were collected from different logs, pre-treated by cut-milling and stored at −20 °C for further analysis according to 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gómez-Brandón et al. (2017a)</xref>.
