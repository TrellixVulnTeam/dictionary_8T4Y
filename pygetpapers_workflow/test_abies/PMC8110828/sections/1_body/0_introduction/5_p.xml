<p>Although the different DNA types have been drawing more attention recently, an in-depth screening of the extra- and intracellular DNA fractions compared to the total DNA pool by high-throughput sequencing technologies is still in its infancy. In this study, we offer a particular habitat as an example on how to obtain a comprehensive picture of the microbial community composition. Deadwood is of interest considering that it acts as an important temporary carbon pool in forest ecosystems (
