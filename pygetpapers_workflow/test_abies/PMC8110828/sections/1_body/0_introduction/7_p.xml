<p>By analyzing these three DNA types we aimed to answer the following questions: (i) Does bacterial richness differ among DNA types and does it increase with progressing decay?; (ii) What can bacteriome information from the intra- and extracellular DNA contribute to the picture drawn by the total DNA pool?; (iii) Is there a masking effect of the extracellular DNA over the intracellular DNA?; and (iv) from our results, can we extrapolate some guidelines that may help in choosing the most suitable DNA type for molecular screening according to the specific research question?</p>
