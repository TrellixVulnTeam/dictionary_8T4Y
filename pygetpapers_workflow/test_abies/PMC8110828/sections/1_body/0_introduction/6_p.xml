<p>The role of bacterial communities in the deadwood habitat is still underexplored compared to fungi (

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Gómez-Brandón et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, the variations among bacterial communities within and between decay stages are poorly studied, as previously emphasized (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Hoppe et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Kielak et al., 2016b</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). Exploring such variations can increase our understanding about the dynamics of the deadwood ecosystem in terms of key players, functional redundant decomposers, and microbial succession. Therefore, we collected natural deadwood logs of Norway spruce (

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Hunter (1990)</xref> – in a well described study area in the Italian Alps (Val di Rabbi, Trentino; 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Petrillo et al., 2015</xref>). For an in-depth screening of the deadwood bacteriome, we compared the bacterial community analyzed by Illumina sequencing of the V4 16S rDNA of the directly extracted total DNA pool and its sequentially extracted extracellular and intracellular fractions.
