<p>While the intracellular DNA represents intact and thus, potentially living cells (without the possibility to discriminate between active and dormant cells), the extracellular DNA originates either from cell lysis and/or active secretion (

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Regarding the active release of DNA, it is still unknown if DNA is released on purpose or randomly. There is evidence that its secretion into the environment is a common feature of both Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes and might provide selective advantages: 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Nagler et al. (2018b)</xref> reported that the concentration of microbial extracellular DNA is proportional to microbial activity. Moreover, extracellular DNA was found to be a quorum sensing signal and the concentrations of conspecific extracellular DNA were shown to regulate cell growth of bacteria, fungi, algae, plants, protozoa, and insects, e.g., in the innate defense system (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Ferrusquía-Jiménez et al., 2020</xref>). However, in addition to its signaling ability, extracellular DNA is relevant as it can foster genetic exchange via natural transformation and serve as a nutrient source (
