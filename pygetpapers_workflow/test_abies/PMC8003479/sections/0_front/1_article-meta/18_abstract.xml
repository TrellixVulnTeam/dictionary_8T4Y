 <p>Conifers are a group of woody plants with an enormous economic and ecological importance. Breeding programs are necessary to select superior varieties for planting, but they have many limitations due to the biological characteristics of conifers. Somatic embryogenesis (SE) and de novo organogenesis (DNO) from in vitro cultured tissues are two ways of plant mass propagation that help to overcome this problem. Although both processes are difficult to achieve in conifers, they offer advantages like a great efficiency, the possibilities to cryopreserve the embryogenic lines, and the ability of multiplying adult trees (the main bottleneck in conifer cloning) through DNO. Moreover, SE and DNO represent appropriate experimental systems to study the molecular bases of developmental processes in conifers such as embryogenesis and shoot apical meristem (SAM) establishment. Some of the key genes regulating these processes belong to the 
  <italic>WOX</italic> and 
  <italic>KNOX</italic> homeobox gene families, whose function has been widely described in 
  <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. The sequences and roles of these genes in conifers are similar to those found in angiosperms, but some particularities exist, like the presence of 
  <italic>WOXX</italic>, a gene that putatively participates in the establishment of SAM in somatic embryos and plantlets of 
  <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic>.
