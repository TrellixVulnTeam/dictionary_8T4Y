<p>In conifers, 
 <italic>WUS</italic> expression is low during the first stages of SE and reaches a peak in somatic mature embryos, when the SAM is already established [
 <xref rid="B68-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="B69-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In 3-week-old plantlets, transcripts were detected exclusively in a small group of cells situated in the central zone of the SAM through RT-qPCR and in situ mRNA hybridization [
 <xref rid="B69-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], which might indicate that 
 <italic>PpWUS</italic> regulates the balance between proliferation and differentiation of stem cells, similarly to what was established in angiosperms. Interestingly, the effects of inducible ectopic expression of 
 <italic>AtWUS</italic> were analyzed in different stages of SE, germinating somatic embryos and seedlings in 
 <italic>Picea glauca</italic> [
 <xref rid="B87-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Expression of 
 <italic>AtWUS</italic> caused important alterations during somatic embryo formation. In germinating embryos, induction of 
 <italic>AtWUS</italic> expression inhibited root growth, but normal shoot development was observed, supporting the participation of this gene in SAM maintenance. In contrast to 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, expression of 
 <italic>AtWUS</italic> did not induce ectopic shoot formation on 
 <italic>Picea glauca</italic> seedlings. It is noticeable that the WUS clade in gymnosperms contains a gene absent in angiosperms called 
 <italic>WOXX,</italic> whose expression profile during SE and in plantlets in 
 <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic> is similar to that described for 
 <italic>PpWUS</italic> [
 <xref rid="B69-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,
 <xref rid="B88-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>].
