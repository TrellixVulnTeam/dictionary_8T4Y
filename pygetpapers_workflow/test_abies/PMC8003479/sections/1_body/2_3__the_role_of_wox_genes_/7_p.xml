<p>Before 
 <italic>WUS</italic> functionality in the SAM was established, some authors proposed that 
 <italic>WOX5</italic> regulated stem cell maintenance both in the SAM and RAM in conifers [
 <xref rid="B68-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="B90-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. This hypothesis was based on the fact that 
 <italic>WOX5</italic> transcripts were detected by RT-qPCR mainly in root apexes but also in shoot apexes in several coniferous species, whereas no 
 <italic>WUS</italic> expression was detected in any tissues or developmental stages at that moment. However, as we mentioned before, recent studies have determined that 
 <italic>WUS</italic> and 
 <italic>WOX5</italic> exert their functions of stem cell regulators in the SAM and RAM, respectively, in conifers [
 <xref rid="B69-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Although current evidence support that the functional differentiation of 
 <italic>WUS</italic> and 
 <italic>WOX5</italic> took place before the gymnospermâ€“angiosperm split, it cannot be discarded an additional role of 
 <italic>WOX5</italic> in conifer SAM functioning based on its expression pattern during SE and in plantlets (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-12-00438">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Similar to 
 <italic>WUS</italic>, 
 <italic>WOX5</italic> also reaches maximum expression levels during SE in mature embryos in 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> and 
 <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic>, and expression of this gene was also detected in shoot apexes of plantlets [
 <xref rid="B68-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="B69-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In addition, recent interspecies complementation experiments have shown that the expression of both 
 <italic>WUS</italic> and 
 <italic>WOX5</italic> orthologues from different gymnosperm species under the control of 
 <italic>AtWUS</italic> and 
 <italic>AtWOX5</italic> promoters can rescue the phenotypes of the 
 <italic>Arabidopsis wus-1</italic> and 
 <italic>wox5-1</italic> loss-of-function mutants [
 <xref rid="B91-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. These findings suggest that gymnosperm WUS and WOX5 proteins are interchangeable when expressed under the right conditions, as it had been previously established in angiosperms [
 <xref rid="B92-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>].
