<p>Based on these results, Alvarez et al. [
 <xref rid="B93-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] analyzed the expression pattern of 
 <italic>PpWUS</italic>, 
 <italic>PpWOXX</italic> and 
 <italic>PpWOX5</italic> during the induction phase of in vitro caulogenesis in 
 <italic>Pinus pinea</italic> to determine their participation in de novo shoot meristem formation. In particular, transcript levels of these genes, among others, were measured in 
 <italic>Pinus pinea</italic> cotyledons cultured on the presence and absence of 44.4 µM BA during short and long times of culture (0–1 d and 2–6 d, respectively) and analyzed by principal component analysis. The authors found that no 
 <italic>PpWOXX</italic> expression was detected along the process, whereas 
 <italic>PpWUS</italic> seems to have an important role at long times of induction. In 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, it was also reported that cytokinin signaling eventually lead to the upregulation of 
 <italic>WUS</italic> during the induction phase of de novo shoot organogenesis in the center of the incipient shoot meristem [

 <xref rid="B96-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Expression data were also analyzed in 
 <italic>Pinus pinea</italic> cotyledons together with the endogenous content of several PGRs by partial least squares regression. Results reinforced the participation of 
 <italic>PpWUS</italic> in the organogenic induction at long times of culture, but also pointed out that 
 <italic>PpWOX5</italic> has a relevant participation in this process, although its exact role still remains unknown.
