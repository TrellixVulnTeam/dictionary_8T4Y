 <italic>WOX</italic> genes constitute a plant-specific homeobox family whose members have important functions during plant growth and development, such as embryo patterning, organ formation and stem cell maintenance. Phylogenetic analyses carried out by van der Graaff et al. [
 <xref rid="B67-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] have established three distinct clades in the 
 <italic>WOX</italic> gene family: the ancient clade, whose members are present in all plant lineages from green algae to seed plants; the intermediate clade, present in vascular plants; and the modern or WUS clade, only found in ferns and seed plants. The 
 <italic>WOX</italic> gene family includes 14 members in 
 <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic> and 13 in 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> distributed throughout the three clades previously mentioned [

 <xref rid="B69-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The analysis of their expression during SE and in different plantlet tissues by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), RNA sequencing and in situ mRNA hybridization showed that the expression profiles of 
 <italic>WOX</italic> genes in conifers are quite similar to those described for their angiosperm counterparts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00438-f003">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting a high degree of conservation of the gene family across seed plants [
