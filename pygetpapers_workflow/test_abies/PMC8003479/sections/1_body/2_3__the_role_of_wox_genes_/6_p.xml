<p>On the other side, analyses of conifer 
 <italic>WOX3</italic> orthologues suggest their involvement in lateral organ formation and differentiation, but not in meristem formation. Expression of 
 <italic>PaWOX3</italic> was very low during early and late embryogenesis in 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic>, reaching its highest value in mature somatic embryos [
 <xref rid="B89-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. In particular, these authors detected 
 <italic>PaWOX3</italic> expression at the base and lateral margins of cotyledons from mature embryos through in situ mRNA hybridization and GUS staining in pPaWOX3:GUS lines. Furthermore, downregulation of 
 <italic>PaWOX3</italic> through RNAi did not affect somatic embryo formation, but alters their cotyledon morphology. In three-week-old plantlets of 
 <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic>, Alvarez et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] detected 
 <italic>PpWOX3</italic> transcripts in lateral organs and in the peripheral zone of the SAM, where organ initiation takes place (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00438-f003">Figure 3</xref>B and
