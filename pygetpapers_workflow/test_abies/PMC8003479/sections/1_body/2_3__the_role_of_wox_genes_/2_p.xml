<p>Ancient-clade genes are constitutively expressed in all developmental stages of SE but also in all plantlet tissues analyzed in 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> and 
 <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic> [
 <xref rid="B68-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="B69-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-12-00438">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>), which is consistent to what was previously reported in angiosperms [
 <xref rid="B70-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], although their function in conifers still remains unknown. In contrast, the WUS-clade member 
 <italic>WOX2</italic> and most members from the intermediate clade are mainly expressed during early and late SE, with low expression levels in mature somatic embryos, both in 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> and 
 <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic> [
 <xref rid="B68-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="B69-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Besides, expression of 
 <italic>PaWOX2</italic> was also detected by in situ mRNA hybridization in immature zygotic embryos in 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic>, but not in the mature ones [
 <xref rid="B71-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. However, practically no expression was found during zygotic embryo germination or in plantlets for 
 <italic>WOX2</italic> and most intermediate members in the analyzed coniferous species. Based on this expression pattern, 
 <italic>WOX2</italic> has been proposed as a good marker of early stages of SE in 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> [
 <xref rid="B72-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,
 <xref rid="B73-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. For example, 
 <italic>WOX2</italic> allowed distinguishing EMs from non-embryogenic calli during SE from primordial shoots in 
 <italic>Picea glauca</italic> [
 <xref rid="B32-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Similarly, this gene was only expressed in EMs derived from shoots buds and immature zygotic embryos, but not in non-embryogenic callus induced from young needles of 1-month-old seedlings in 
 <italic>Pinus contorta</italic> [
 <xref rid="B74-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].
