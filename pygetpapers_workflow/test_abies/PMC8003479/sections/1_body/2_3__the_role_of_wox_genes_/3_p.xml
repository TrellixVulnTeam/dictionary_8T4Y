<p>Orthologues of these genes in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, 
 <italic>AtWOX2</italic> and the members from the intermediate clade 
 <italic>AtWOX8</italic> and 
 <italic>AtWOX9</italic> are involved in early embryonic pattern formation [
 <xref rid="B75-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,
 <xref rid="B76-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Basically, 
 <italic>AtWOX2</italic> and 
 <italic>AtWOX8</italic> are expressed in the female gametophyte and zygote. After the first division 
 <italic>AtWOX2</italic> transcripts are only detected in the apical daughter cell that will originate the embryo proper, while 
 <italic>AtWOX8</italic> expression is restricted to the basal daughter cell that will give rise to the embryo suspensor and the hypophyseal cell, establishing in that way the apical-basal polarity of the embryo. For its part, 
 <italic>AtWOX9</italic> also contributes to the embryo polarity, as it is expressed initially in the hypophysis and then expands into the central domain of the embryo. In 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic>, 
 <italic>PaWOX2</italic> and the intermediate-clade member 
 <italic>PaWOX8/9</italic> have been also shown to participate in the establishment of the apical-basal embryo pattern during early embryo development [
 <xref rid="B71-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,
 <xref rid="B77-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. In order to unravel their role in this process, RNA interference (RNAi) lines for each gene were constructed using both constitutive and inducible promoters. Downregulation of 
 <italic>PaWOX2</italic> and 
 <italic>PaWOX8/9</italic> through RNAi during the first stages of SE results in aberrant embryos due to the lack of a well-defined border between the globular EM and the suspensor, failing to form mature somatic embryos at a higher frequency than the control lines. In both cases, the effects of inhibiting their expression are observed mainly during early embryo differentiation, and practically no defects were observed when downregulation takes place after late embryo formation. In the case of 
 <italic>PaWOX8/9</italic>, an alteration of the cell division planes in the basal cells of the EM, and the differentiation of suspensor cells (both basal and top cells), was observed by confocal microscopy [
 <xref rid="B77-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. In fact, it was reported that 
 <italic>PaWOX8/9</italic> RNAi lines showed altered expression levels of several cell-cycle-regulating genes. Whereas 
 <italic>PaWOX8/9</italic> regulates cell division at the transcriptional level and cell fate determination, downregulation of 
 <italic>PaWOX2</italic> does not affect the expression of the genes that participate in the regulation of the cell cycle [
 <xref rid="B71-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Instead of that, high expression levels of 
 <italic>PaWOX2</italic> are required during early embryogenesis for the correct development of the protoderm, the external layer of the globular embryo which will give rise to the epidermis, in early and late embryos. Furthermore, this gene has been shown to be essential for the expansion of the suspensor cells during early embryo development. Other members from the intermediate clade in conifers are phylogenetically close to 
 <italic>AtWOX11</italic> and 
 <italic>AtWOX12</italic>, which have been related to root organogenesis [
 <xref rid="B78-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], although no information about their role in conifers is still available.
