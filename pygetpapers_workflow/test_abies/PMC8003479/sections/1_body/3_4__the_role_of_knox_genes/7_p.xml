<p>Based on the expression data commented above and its phylogenetic proximity, some authors proposed that 
 <italic>KN1</italic> and 
 <italic>KN2</italic> orthologues might perform redundant roles during early embryogeny in conifers [
 <xref rid="B115-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>,
 <xref rid="B116-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Furthermore, these genes are located close to each other on the same linkage group and are thought to have arisen after a duplication event [
 <xref rid="B114-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. For its part, 
 <italic>KN3</italic> and 
 <italic>KN4</italic> seem to play a key role in SAM formation during SE in 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> [
 <xref rid="B116-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. It is remarkable that conifer 
 <italic>KN3</italic> orthologues are phylogenetically very close to 
 <italic>AtSTM</italic> [
 <xref rid="B115-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Interestingly, class I 
 <italic>KNOX</italic> gene expression during de novo shoot organogenesis in 
 <italic>Pinus pinea</italic> was analyzed by multivariate statistics, revealing that both 
 <italic>PpKN2</italic> and 
 <italic>PpKN3</italic> have a relevant role during the acquisition of shoot meristem identity [
 <xref rid="B93-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-12-00438">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). However, further studies are necessary to elucidate the specific role of each class I member in conifers.
