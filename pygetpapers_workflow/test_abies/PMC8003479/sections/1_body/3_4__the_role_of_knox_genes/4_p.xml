<p>The role of 
 <italic>PaKN1</italic> during embryogenesis was deeply studied in transgenic lines of 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> [
 <xref rid="B118-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Overexpression of this gene accelerates the formation of early embryos from EMs, which also have bigger embryogenic heads and enlarged suspensors compared to the control, and eventually lead to the formation of mature cotyledonary embryos at a higher frequency. These embryos have similar morphology and germination rates than control ones, giving rise to viable plants with no phenotypical defects, although it is remarkable that embryos derived from 
 <italic>PaKN1</italic>-overexpressing lines tend to have enlarged SAMs. In contrast, down-regulation of 
 <italic>PaKN1</italic> significantly reduced differentiation of EMs into immature somatic embryos, which failed to form mature cotyledonary embryos. These results support the relevance of 
 <italic>PaKN1</italic> during the first stages of embryo development, although it also has an important role during late embryogenesis. Later studies have found that 
 <italic>PaKN1</italic> expression affects glutathione and ascorbate metabolism, which play a key role in embryo development [
