<p>Results from Klimaszewska et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] suggest that 
 <italic>KN1</italic> and 
 <italic>KN2</italic> can be used as markers during the initial steps of SE for the discrimination of EMs from non-embryogenic calli. This is not the case of 
 <italic>KN3</italic>, which showed high expression in non-embryogenic calli in 
 <italic>Picea glauca</italic>. However, 
 <italic>KN3</italic> and 
 <italic>KN4</italic> orthologues might constitute good markers for the maturation competence of embryogenic lines [
