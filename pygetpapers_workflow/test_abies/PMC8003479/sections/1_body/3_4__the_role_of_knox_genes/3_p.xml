<p>Due to the important participation of class I members in the embryogenic developmental pathway in angiosperm, particularly in meristem formation and establishment, class I members have been studied during SE and de novo shoot organogenesis in conifers in order to determine their specific role in these processes. Expression of class I 
 <italic>KNOX</italic> genes was reported along the maturation phase of SE in 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> and 
 <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic> [
 <xref rid="B115-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>,
 <xref rid="B116-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. The expression of the four class I members was analyzed in competent and non-competent embryogenic lines from 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> [
 <xref rid="B113-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>,
 <xref rid="B116-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Results showed that 
 <italic>HBK1</italic> and 
 <italic>HBK3</italic> (here designated 
 <italic>PaKN2</italic> and 
 <italic>PaKN1</italic>, respectively, for convenience) expressed in both types of lines, whereas expression of 
 <italic>HBK2</italic> and 
 <italic>HBK4</italic> (here designated 
 <italic>PaKN3</italic> and 
 <italic>PaKN4</italic>, respectively, for convenience) was only detected in those lines that give rise to mature cotyledonary embryos, but not in those in which conversion of EMs to embryos is blocked. The expression profiles of these four class I genes were also analyzed in different developmental stages of 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> embryogenic lines treated and non-treated with N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA), an inhibitor of the polar auxin transport [
 <xref rid="B116-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Previous studies had shown that polar auxin transport is essential for the correct formation of a functional SAM and RAM during embryogenesis, as NPA treatment gives rise to the formation of aberrant somatic embryos with fused or aborted cotyledons that lack a visible SAM, and are unable to germinate [
 <xref rid="B117-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. An increase in 
 <italic>PaKN3</italic> and 
 <italic>PaKN4</italic> expression was detected during SAM establishment in control lines, which is delayed in NPA-treated lines, suggesting that these genes are essential for the proper SAM formation during embryogenesis. On the other side, 
 <italic>PaKN1</italic> and 
 <italic>PaKN2</italic> expression was upregulated during the first stages of embryogenesis, and their levels were not altered by NPA treatment along the process. These results indicate that these genes have a more general role in embryo development, especially during the early phases of embryogenesis, but not in SAM establishment.
