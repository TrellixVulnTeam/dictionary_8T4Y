 <italic>KNOX</italic> genes constitute another plant-specific homeobox gene family whose members have been found in practically all plant lineages: green algae, bryophytes, lycophytes, ferns, angiosperms and gymnosperms. Whereas only one class of 
 <italic>KNOX</italic> genes has been reported in algae, phylogenetical analyses established two different subfamilies in land plants designated class I and class II [
 <xref rid="B97-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>,
 <xref rid="B98-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Recently, 
 <italic>KNOX</italic> genes lacking the characteristic homeodomain were described exclusively in some dicotyledonous species, which constituted the so-called class M subfamily [
 <xref rid="B99-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. 
 <italic>KNOX</italic> genes from class I and class II subfamilies differ in their sequence, expression patterns and function. In angiosperms, class I members are mainly expressed in meristematic regions. The 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> gene named 
 <italic>SHOOT MERISTEMLESS</italic> (
 <italic>STM</italic>) is essential for SAM formation during embryogenesis and participates in the maintenance of the stem cell population in the center of the SAM [

 <xref rid="B101-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Loss-of-function 
 <italic>stm</italic> mutants lack a functional SAM [
 <xref rid="B102-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>,
 <xref rid="B103-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], whereas overexpression of this gene results in the formation of ectopic meristems and lobed leaves [
 <xref rid="B104-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], which indicates a role of 
 <italic>STM</italic> in determining leaf morphology [
 <xref rid="B105-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Furthermore, 
 <italic>STM</italic> expression is upregulated during de novo shoot organogenesis [
 <xref rid="B106-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. 
 <italic>STM</italic> along with other class I members like 
 <italic>BREVIPEDICELLUS/KNOTTED IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA 1</italic> (
 <italic>BP/KNAT1</italic>) and 
 <italic>KNAT2</italic> also play a key role in the development of floral meristem and carpel formation [
 <xref rid="B107-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>,
 <xref rid="B108-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>,
 <xref rid="B109-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. For its part, the class I member 
 <italic>KNAT6</italic> is expressed during embryogenesis and participates in the establishment of the boundaries between the SAM and cotyledons [
 <xref rid="B110-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>] (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-12-00438">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). On the other side, class II 
 <italic>KNOX</italic> genes are expressed mainly in differentiating tissues and mature organs, and participate in organ differentiation [
 <xref rid="B111-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>] (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-12-00438">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Unlike 
 <italic>STM</italic>, overexpression of class II members causes a simplification of leaf morphology in plants with complex leaves [
 <xref rid="B105-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>].
