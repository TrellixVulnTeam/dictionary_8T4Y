<p>In conifers, four class I members have been described to date in several spruce and pine species, which were designated 
 <italic>KN1</italic> to 
 <italic>KN4</italic> [

 <xref rid="B115-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. More recently, two members from class II subfamily were isolated in 
 <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic> and other coniferous species, which were designated 
 <italic>KN5</italic> and 
 <italic>KN6</italic> [

 <xref rid="B115-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Studies of their expression by RT-qPCR and in situ mRNA hybridization in plantlets (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00438-f003">Figure 3</xref>), together with analyses of their overexpression in the heterologous system 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, support that the functional differentiation established in angiosperms might be evolutionarily conserved between gymnosperms and angiosperms to a great extent [

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-12-00438">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Function and/or expression domains of 
 <italic>KNOX</italic> genes from different coniferous species and their 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> counterparts are summarized in
