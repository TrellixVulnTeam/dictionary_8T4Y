<p>Class I 
 <italic>KNOX</italic> expression was also analyzed during the initiation of SE from primordial shoots in 
 <italic>Picea glauca</italic> [
 <xref rid="B32-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In particular, transcript levels of 
 <italic>SKN1</italic>, 
 <italic>SKN2</italic>, 
 <italic>SKN3</italic> and 
 <italic>SKN4</italic> (here designated 
 <italic>PgKN1</italic> to 
 <italic>PgKN4</italic> for convenience) were measured in primordial shoots after different incubation times on induction medium (0, 3 and 6 days), in EMs and in non-embryogenic tissue, among other tissues. All 
 <italic>PgKN</italic> genes were already expressed in non-treated primordial shoots. In fact, 
 <italic>PgKN4</italic> is expressed mainly in the initial explants and decreases with incubation time. Little 
 <italic>PgKN4</italic> expression was detected in Ems, and it was undetectable in non-embryogenic tissue. For its part, 
 <italic>PgKN1</italic> and 
 <italic>PgKN2</italic> showed a similar expression pattern, as the highest expression of these genes was reported in Ems, and no expression was detected in non-embryogenic tissue. On the other side, 
 <italic>PgKN3</italic> expresses at very high level in non-embryogenic tissue.
