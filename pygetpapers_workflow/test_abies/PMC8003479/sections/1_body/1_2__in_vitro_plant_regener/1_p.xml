<p>The two main micropropagation methods for plant regeneration are SE and DNO. Somatic embryogenesis is defined as the formation of embryos (bipolar structures containing both shoot and root meristems) from somatic cells in a process similar to zygotic embryogenesis. For its part, DNO usually involves the induction of de novo adventitious shoots on primary explants (shoot organogenesis or caulogenesis), which are subsequently excised and rooted to form plantlets (root organogenesis or rhizogenesis).</p>
