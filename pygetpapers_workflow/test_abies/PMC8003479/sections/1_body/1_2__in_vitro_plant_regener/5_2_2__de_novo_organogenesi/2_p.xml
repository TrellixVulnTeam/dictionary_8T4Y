<p>The initial explants most commonly used in DNO are complete mature zygotic embryos or parts thereof such as isolated cotyledons. In these cases, DNO is generally a direct process, as both types of explants are competent per se to respond to caulogenic stimulus without a previous dedifferentiation or callus phase [

 <xref rid="B47-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Nevertheless, DNO can also be achieved from needle fascicles, dormant shoot buds or apical meristems. The induction medium is usually supplemented with cytokinins, being BA the most used, because it has been proven that cytokinins alone are sufficient to induce caulogenesis [

For each species, it is necessary to determine the optimal type and concentration of cytokinins; the minimum time of explant incubation on induction medium to elicit shoot formation (minimum induction period), which marks the onset of determination; and the period of cytokinin exposure that provides the maximal response, as longer incubation times will not enhance caulogenesis. For example, Cuesta et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] obtained response after only 6 h of incubation of 
 <italic>Pinus pinea</italic> cotyledons on induction medium supplemented with 44.4 µM BA, and maximal response was obtained after 2–4 days [
 <xref rid="B49-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The effectiveness of DNO is determined by parameters such as the percentage of shoot-forming explants and the average number of adventitious shoots formed per explant.
