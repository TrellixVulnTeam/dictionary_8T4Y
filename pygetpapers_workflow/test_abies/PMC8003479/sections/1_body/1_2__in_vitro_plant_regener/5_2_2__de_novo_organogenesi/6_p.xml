<p>Compared to SE, DNO from zygotic embryos have the disadvantage that there are no effective long-term cryopreservation methods to maintain the juvenility of the material until field trials are finished, with few exceptions (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B26-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]). The development of effective cryopreservation protocols or appropriate genetic markers would allow within-family selection of superior genotypes, and organogenesis would become as effective as SE in achieving genetic gain [
 <xref rid="B4-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In spite of this inconvenience, DNO is used when their effectiveness is higher than that of SE, as it happens in 
 <italic>Pinus pinea</italic>. In this specie, only around 0.5% of initial zygotic embryos produce established embryogenic lines [
 <xref rid="B60-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] whereas at least 70 plantlets per seed can be produced at optimal conditions through organogenesis [
 <xref rid="B56-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Somatic embryogenesis and DNO may be also used together, which is particularly useful when maturation and germination rates of somatic embryos are very low, especially in genetically transformed lines. Montalbán et al. [
 <xref rid="B61-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] reported that each somatic embryo in 
 <italic>Pinus radiata</italic> can form around 19 adventitious shoots, with a rooting rate of 60%. Alvarez et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] also found axillary shoot formation after the culture of 
 <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic> mature somatic embryos in the presence of 10 µM BA for 7 days, which could be isolated and rooted, increasing the yield of SE.
