<p>One advantage of DNO against SE is the possibility to regenerate plants using explants derived from adult selected genotypes and appropriate protocols (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B62-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]). Thus, Cortizo et al. [
 <xref rid="B63-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] reported shoot initiation in brachyblast primordia from winter-dormant buds collected from 20–25 year-old trees in 
 <italic>Pinus pinea</italic>. In particular, the buds without scales were sectioned into slices of 0.5–1 cm in thickness and cultured on a medium with 2.5 µM of thidiazuron, a synthetic compound with cytokinin activity. After that, the explants were transferred to a PGR-free elongation medium for the development of the microshoots. When these reached approximately 1 cm, they were isolated, elongated and eventually rooted (adventitious roots). The downsides of this protocol are the high influence of the donor genotype in the response and the low rooting rates obtained, which suggest that this method induced reinvigoration instead of rejuvenation. Similar protocols have been described for adult trees of 
 <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic> [
 <xref rid="B64-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and 
 <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> [
 <xref rid="B65-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The difference was that the elongated needle fascicles were excised and cultured again on initial medium to promote axillary bud proliferation. In 
 <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic>, high organogenic response was achieved with 25 µM zeatin and meta-topolin, but only those shoots obtained under 25 µM BA were able to develop properly and form adventitious roots. Multiplication of adult trees can also be achieved through the culture of apical meristems. Another alternative strategy is the introduction of adult material in vitro via microblast micrografting in seedling rootstocks [
