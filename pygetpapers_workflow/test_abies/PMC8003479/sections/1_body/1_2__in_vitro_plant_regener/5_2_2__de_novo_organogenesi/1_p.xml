<p>Micropropagation via DNO typically begins with the differentiation of adventitious shoots on primary explants, a process that occurs through three stages. The first is the acquisition of morphogenetic competence, which is frequently associated with some level of cellular dedifferentiation. The other two stages consist of the specification of cell identity for shoot formation in response to the organogenic stimulus (induction phase), and the adventitious shoot development in the absence of that stimulus [
