<p>After the induction phase, explants are transferred to the expression medium without PGRs, where meristemoids give rise to the formation of adventitious shoots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00438-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B). Elongated shoots are then isolated and cultured firstly on root initiation medium, which is supplemented with auxins, and subsequently on root expression medium in the absence of PGRs. In 
 <italic>Pinus radiata</italic>, it was reported that indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) is more efficient than 1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) for plant production [
 <xref rid="B48-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], although NAA has been routinely used for adventitious root formation on 
 <italic>Pinus pinea</italic> microshoots [
 <xref rid="B56-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Once rooting is finished (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00438-f002">Figure 2</xref>C), regenerated plantlets are ready for acclimatization prior to transference to field (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00438-f002">Figure 2</xref>D). Rooting is considered one of the main bottlenecks of this technique, as very low rooting rates were obtained for some species, and a high dependence on the seed genotype was observed.
