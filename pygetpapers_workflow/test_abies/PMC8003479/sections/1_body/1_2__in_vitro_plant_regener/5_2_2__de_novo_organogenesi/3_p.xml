<p>The organogenic response is dependent on genotype and tissue differentiation of primary explants. In 
 <italic>Pinus pinea</italic>, an important variability in caulogenic response of cotyledons from six half-sibling families was found [
 <xref rid="B50-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and differences were associated with the endogenous cytokinin content of cotyledonary explants throughout the organogenic process [
 <xref rid="B51-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. On the other hand, cotyledons excised from germinated embryos during 2, 4 and 6 days showed a loss of competence compared with those excised from non-germinated embryos [
 <xref rid="B52-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Embryo germination caused a reduction in the number of buds per cotyledon, which were exclusively localized in its basal part. This effect was related to a reduction of the endogenous levels of active cytokinins and the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). It might also be a consequence of tissue differentiation, a decrease in the sensitivity to exogenous BA, and/or a decrease in BA uptake caused by the presence of waxes on the surface of precultured cotyledons [
 <xref rid="B53-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Similarly, the pre-culture of 
 <italic>Pinus strobus</italic> embryos on basal medium for 2 days prior to the induction caused a significant reduction in the caulogenic response [
 <xref rid="B54-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, some exceptions have been reported, as pre-culture of 
 <italic>Pinus radiata</italic> seeds for 7 days enhanced the caulogenic response [
 <xref rid="B55-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].
