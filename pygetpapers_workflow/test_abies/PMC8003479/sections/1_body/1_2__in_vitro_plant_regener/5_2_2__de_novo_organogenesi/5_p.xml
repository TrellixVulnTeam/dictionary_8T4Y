<p>Plant multiplication via indirect organogenesis has also been reported in some coniferous species such as 
 <italic>Pinus taeda</italic> [
 <xref rid="B57-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], 
 <italic>Pinus radiata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B58-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and 
 <italic>Pinus strobus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B59-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In all cases, organogenesis was achieved by culturing mature zygotic embryos in a medium for the formation of morphogenetic calli. The combination of PGRs and their concentrations used varies extraordinarily among species. In 
 <italic>Pinus taeda</italic>, a high rate of callus initiation was reached adding 10 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> NAA and 4 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> BA [
 <xref rid="B57-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] to the medium, whereas 2,4-D, NAA and IAA alone were able to induce callus formation in 
 <italic>Pinus strobus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B59-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In 
 <italic>Pinus radiata</italic>, nodular calli were initiated from explants on medium only containing BA, but efficient proliferation took place in other supplemented with BA and IBA [
 <xref rid="B58-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. After proliferation, calli are transferred to the organogenic induction medium, which usually contains auxin and cytokinin at a certain proportion, for differentiating adventitious buds. Then, buds are elongated and finally rooted. Tang and Newton [
 <xref rid="B59-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] demonstrated that treatment of calli at 4 °C for 6 weeks improved the yield of the process. Furthermore, the addition of putrescine to the media decreased callus browning and improved callus formation, adventitious bud formation and rooting rates, as this polyamine reduces lipid peroxidation.
