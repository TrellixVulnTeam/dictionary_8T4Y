<p>In conifers, SE was reported for the first time in 1985 in

Somatic embryogenesis is usually the preferred method for clonal propagation in conifers, but DNO can be used for species recalcitrant to SE or when this means a higher plant yield. Despite both techniques offering advantages for mass vegetative propagation, they have limitations such as SE and DNO are mainly achieved using juvenile material as explants (reviewed in [

 <xref rid="B27-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]). Furthermore, stress during in vitro culture can cause permanent or reversible changes in explants such as chromosomal rearrangements, sequence changes in genes relevant for regeneration, alterations of the ploidy level, epigenetic changes or the activation of transposable elements, resulting in regenerated plants that are not true-to-type from their donor plant (for a complete review see [
