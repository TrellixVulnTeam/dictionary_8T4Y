<p>The development of cotyledonary somatic embryos from EMs includes embryo differentiation and maturation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00438-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). The first requires the withdrawal of the PGRs used during proliferation, so the EMs are cultured on a PGR-free medium for 1–2 weeks. During differentiation, the embryo goes through several developmental stages (early, late and cotyledonary embryo), which have been well documented in 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> [
 <xref rid="B7-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and 
 <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic> [
 <xref rid="B44-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], the latter shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00438-f001">Figure 1</xref>E–H. One difference between both species is that embryos of 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> differentiate in a very synchronous way, while several developmental stages can be distinguished at the same time in 
 <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic>. Somatic embryos complete their differentiation and undergo maturation when they are cultured in a medium with higher concentration of gelling agent and carbohydrate, and with osmotic agents such as polyethylene glycol. All these factors reduce the water availability for embryos, promoting the growth arrest, the accumulation of storage reserves and the acquisition of desiccation tolerance [
 <xref rid="B20-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The addition of abscisic acid also improves somatic embryo maturation, an essential process for proper germination of conifers embryos. A compilation of maturation medium formulation for different pine species can be found in Lelu-Walter et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Finally, cotyledonary mature somatic embryos are germinated for obtaining plantlets that will be acclimatized in the greenhouse before transference to field (
