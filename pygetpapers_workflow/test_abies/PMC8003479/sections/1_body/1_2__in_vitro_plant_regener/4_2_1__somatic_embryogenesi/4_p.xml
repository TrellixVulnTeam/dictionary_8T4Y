<p>Prolonged serial subcultures of EMs during the multiplication phase negatively affect the number of somatic embryos obtained, the further germination of embryos and the genetic stability of cells, which can produce somaclonal variation [

 <xref rid="B41-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A solution to avoid these problems is to cryopreserve the embryogenic lines within the first 2â€“4 months after initiation. This allows the conservation of EMs until field tests of trees regenerated from somatic embryos are finished. Direct cryopreservation of EMs was successfully achieved in several species (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B26-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]), but the most usual practice is to enclose the embryos with a chemical cryoprotectant. Some of these compounds, like dimethyl sulfoxide, might cause abnormalities in embryogenic lines. Therefore, it is recommended to assess the genetic stability of the embryogenic lines recovered and the emblings (seedlings obtained from somatic embryos) [
