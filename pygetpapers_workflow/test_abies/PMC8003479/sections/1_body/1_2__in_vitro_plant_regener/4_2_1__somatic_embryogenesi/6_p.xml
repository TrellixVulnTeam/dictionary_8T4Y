<p>In summary, SE has several advantages compared to other vegetative propagation techniques. First, it is the most effective method for mass propagation in many coniferous species, and in some cases it can be automated for large-scale production, reducing costs and handing [

Some species are either recalcitrant to plant multiplication through this technique, or their initiation rates are very low, which is common when mature zygotic embryos are used as initial explants [
 <xref rid="B45-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. As we mentioned before, initiation is limited to tissues from embryos or juvenile plants for most coniferous species, so it would be desirable to develop or improve protocols using material from adult trees, whose performance has been already assessed, as initial explants. Another major bottleneck of SE is the conversion of EMs into plants, due to the low rates of maturation, poor quality of the somatic embryos and low germination frequencies observed in certain species. It must be also taken into account that there is a great influence of parental genotypes on initiation rates and other stages of the SE such as maturation or recovering embryogenic lines from cryopreservation, which limits the genotype availability for micropropagation via SE.
