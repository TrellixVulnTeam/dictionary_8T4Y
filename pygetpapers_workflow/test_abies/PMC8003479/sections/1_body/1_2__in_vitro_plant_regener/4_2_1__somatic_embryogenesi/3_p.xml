<p>Primary explants are cultured on the initiation medium, which is usually supplemented with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), a PGR with auxin activity, and the cytokinin N
 <sup>6</sup>-benzyladenine (BA), although other PGRs can be used. In addition, the initiation can take place in the absence of PGRs in some cases. Incubation on this medium gives rise to proliferating EMs, which are soft, mucilaginous and translucent to white cell aggregates. They are also characterized by the presence of small embryogenic heads, constituted by spherical and dense cells, and long vacuolated cells. For immature zygotic embryos, it is typical that EMs protrude through the micropyle (
