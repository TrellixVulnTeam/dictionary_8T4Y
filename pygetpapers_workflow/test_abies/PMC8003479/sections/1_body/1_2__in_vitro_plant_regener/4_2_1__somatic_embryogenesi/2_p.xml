<p>Somatic embryogenesis is mainly achieved from mature zygotic embryos in species with simple polyembryony and from immature zygotic embryos (enclosed within the megagametophyte) in species having cleavage polyembryony [
 <xref rid="B20-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the initiation of embryogenic cultures from mature vegetative explants in conifers is still much more challenging. This is one of the main limitations of SE, as it is only possible to evaluate plant performance during the adult vegetative or reproductive growth phases, but not during the embryonic or juvenile state, so the initial material has an unknown potential interest. The development of SE protocols using material from adult trees would allow the multiplication of trees with assessed performance, and it would reduce the required time to obtain superior varieties considerably [
 <xref rid="B16-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. So far, successful initiation of embryogenic cultures from adult trees was reported in a few cases, for example from needles excised from 3-year-old plants in
