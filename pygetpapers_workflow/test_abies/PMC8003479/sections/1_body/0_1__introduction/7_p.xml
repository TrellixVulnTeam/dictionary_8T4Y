<p>Altogether, these studies allowed the identification of genes that play key roles during SE or DNO in conifers, which were related with processes such as the regulation of the endogenous content and distribution of different PGRs, stress responses, stem cell regulation or cell wall remodeling (for a complete review, see [

 <italic>WOX</italic> and 
 <italic>KNOX</italic> gene families that belong to the homeobox gene superfamily. Homeobox genes are present in all major eukaryotic lineages (invertebrates, vertebrates, plants and fungi) and encode transcriptional factors that play a key role in multiple developmental processes of multicellular organisms. They are characterized by the presence of a highly conserved region of 60 amino acids, named homeodomain, that acts as a DNA-binding domain, thereby regulating the expression of downstream target genes. Plant homeobox proteins are classified into 14 different classes: homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP) I to IV, BEL-like (BEL), KNOTTED1-like homeobox (KNOX), plant zinc finger (PLINC), WUSCHEL-related homeobox (WOX), plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, DDT, Nodulin Homeobox genes (NDX), Luminidependens (LD), SAWADEE and Plant Interactor Homeobox (PINTOX) [
