<p>Domestication of coniferous species through traditional plant breeding is technically more difficult and time-consuming than other crops due to their big size, long generation times, and the prolonged juvenile stage, as most traits that are important for production only can be evaluated during the adult phase. Thus, the application of genetic engineering techniques allows to shorten the breeding process substantially. In this context, SE and DNO are essential because they make possible the regeneration of transgenic plants from explants genetically transformed with genes of interest through biolistic techniques or mediated by 
 <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> (currently called 
 <italic>Rhizobium radiobacter</italic>) (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B5-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). Recently, genome editing technologies like Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/Cas9 have been successfully applied in several herbaceous and woody angiosperms, although no application in gymnosperms has been reported to date [

 <italic>Picea abies</italic> has been proposed as an ideal experimental system for the study of embryo development [

 <italic>Pinus pinea</italic> cotyledons has been used for the analysis of the underlying mechanisms of shoot apical meristem (SAM) establishment, as it is very repetitive, synchronous and the big size of cotyledons facilitates their manipulation [
