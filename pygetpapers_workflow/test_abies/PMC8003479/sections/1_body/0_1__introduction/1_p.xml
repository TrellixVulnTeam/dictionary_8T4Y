Coniferous forests, which cover vast areas in the Northern hemisphere, constitute one of the largest terrestrial carbon sinks and play an important role in climate change mitigation. Conifers also have an enormous economic importance, as they are a renewable source of timber, paper pulp and other non-wood products like resins, natural oils and products with medical use (for example, the anti-cancer drug Taxol). It is estimated that 50% of the global timber is supplied by conifers, mainly by the genus
