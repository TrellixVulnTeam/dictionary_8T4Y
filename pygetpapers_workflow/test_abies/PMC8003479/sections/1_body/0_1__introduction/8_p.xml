<p>In this review, we show the available information about the expression pattern of homeobox genes from the 
 <italic>WOX</italic> and 
 <italic>KNOX</italic> gene families across SE and DNO in conifers, with the aim of elucidating their role in the molecular bases of both developmental processes. Previously, a briefly description of cellular events that occur throughout SE and DNO, and the advantages and limitations of these techniques, is presented.
