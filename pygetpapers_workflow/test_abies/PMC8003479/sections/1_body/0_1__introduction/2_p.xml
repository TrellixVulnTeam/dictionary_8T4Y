<p>Due to the increasing wood demand, conifers have been extensively used for reforestation, and native forests have been replaced by conifer plantations in many areas of the world [

Human activities can disrupt forest ecosystems with the subsequent loss of the genetic diversity, which is essential for the adaptation capability to variable environmental conditions. In the climate change scenario, it must be also taken into account that natural disturbance agents are expected to have a greater impact on forests in the near future, which will be especially pronounced in coniferous forests and boreal biomes compared to broadleaved and mixed forests [
 <xref rid="B3-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In particular, studies suggest that global warming is likely to increase the impact of fire, pests and pathogens on forests at a global scale, and drought will be especially severe in those areas with restricted water availability. Thus, sustainable forest management requires the development of strategies for the preservation of natural forests and the establishment of high-yield plantations with enhanced biomass production. For that purpose, breeding programs for the selection and multiplication of superior varieties with improved production traits such as growth rate, wood quality and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses have been implemented.
