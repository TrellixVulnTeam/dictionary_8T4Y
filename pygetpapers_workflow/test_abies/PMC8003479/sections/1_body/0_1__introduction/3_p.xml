<p>In this context, the development of effective methods for mass clonal propagation of selected genotypes acquires great importance. However, this is not achievable through techniques like grafting or coppicing in conifers [

 <xref rid="B4-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Micropropagation consists of the multiplication of plants using in vitro tissue culture, that is, through the culture of cells, tissues or organs in artificial media, usually supplemented with plant growth regulators (PGRs), under aseptic and very controlled conditions. It exploits the characteristic developmental plasticity of plants to adapt to variable environmental conditions, in particular their high regeneration capacity. Thus, under the appropriate conditions, cultured explants undergo morphogenesis and give rise to somatic embryos, through a process known as somatic embryogenesis (SE), or to adventitious shoots which are late rooted (de novo organogenesis, DNO). In both cases, either SE or DNO, the result is the regeneration of complete plants once the embryos germinate and/or the plants are acclimatized.
