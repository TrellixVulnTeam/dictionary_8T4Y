<p>The use of SE and DNO for all the mentioned purposes requires a deep understanding of their molecular basis, but molecular studies about the biology of conifers are much more difficult than in other plant lineages like angiosperms. These organisms are characterized by extraordinarily large genomes with high heterozygosity levels and high repetitive DNA content. Unlike model plant species such as 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, identification of genes involved in SE and DNO in conifers through forward and reverse genetics is extremely challenging, due to the lack of defective mutants, difficulties for applying techniques like T-DNA insertional mutagenesis, and the fact that the first annotated reference genome was not available until 2013 [
 <xref rid="B9-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The development of next-generation DNA sequencing technologies and powerful bioinformatics methods for the assembly and annotation of the resulting sequences allowed the obtaining of the full genome and/or transcriptome from several coniferous species (for a complete review see [
 <xref rid="B10-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]), which has facilitated the identification of genes putatively involved in traits and processes of interest.
