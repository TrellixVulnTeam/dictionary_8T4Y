<p>Despite the difficulties, genes putatively involved in SE and DNO have been identified through the search in the available databases for sequences with homology to genes associated with in vitro morphogenesis in angiosperms (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B11-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). Recently, the complete transcriptome from different zygotic embryo developmental stages was obtained in 
 <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic>, allowing a better understanding of this process in conifers and the identification of potentially relevant genes during SE [
 <xref rid="B13-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Another approach consists in the comparison of material with different characteristics (e.g., material with different morphogenetic competence, responsive and non-responsive genotypes to the embryogenic or organogenic stimulus, different stages of development along the morphogenetic processâ€¦) through transcriptome and/or proteome profiling to identify differentially expressed genes. For example, Alonso et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] used the suppression subtractive hybridization technique to identify genes putatively involved in the de novo shoot organogenesis in 
 <italic>Pinus pinea</italic>. More recently, Rodrigues et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-genes-12-00438" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] obtained complete small RNA libraries from different developmental stages along SE in 
 <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic> in order to gain insight into the regulation of the process.
