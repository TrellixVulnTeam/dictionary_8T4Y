  <p>De novo organogenesis steps in 
   <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic>. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Meristemoids formed on cotyledons excised from mature embryos that were cultured on the presence of N
   <sup>6</sup>—benzyladenine and subsequently transferred into a medium without plant growth regulators (PGRs). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Elongated adventitious shoots. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Rooted shoots obtained after the culture of the adventitious shoots in a medium containing 1-naphthalene acetic acid and their subsequent transference into a PGR-free medium. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Plantlets growing in the greenhouse for acclimatization. (
   <bold>E</bold>–
   <bold>J</bold>) Representation of the de novo meristem formation process, from promeristemoids to meristemoids forming needle primordia. Incubation of explants (
   <bold>E</bold>) on induction medium results in the formation of promeristemoids (
   <bold>F</bold>–
   <bold>I</bold>), which are cell clusters located within the first subepidermal cell layers of explants. They constitute the precursors of meristemoids (
   <bold>J</bold>), groups of small dense cells that arise in the explant and are determined to form adventitious shoot primordia when explants are transferred to a PGR-free medium. Bar 1 mm (
   <bold>A</bold>), 1 cm (
   <bold>B</bold>–
   <bold>D</bold>). Source: unpublished images from the authors.
