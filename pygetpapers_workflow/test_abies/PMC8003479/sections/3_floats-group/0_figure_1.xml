  <p>Somatic embryogenesis steps in 
   <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic>. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Initiation of embryogenic cultures from immature zygotic embryos enclosed within the megagametophyte and cultured on a medium containing 2,4—dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and N
   <sup>6</sup>—benzyladenine. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Embryogenic masses (EMs) protruding through the micropyle. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Late development and maturation of cotyledonary somatic embryos achieved through the removal of plant growth regulators (PGRs), the increase in the sucrose and gelling agent concentrations, and the addition of abscisic acid (ABA). (
   <bold>D</bold>) Germination and acclimatization of plantlets. (
   <bold>E</bold>–
   <bold>H</bold>) Representation of different developmental stages across embryo differentiation. The absence of PGRs triggers the differentiation of EMs (
   <bold>E</bold>) into the early embryos (
   <bold>F</bold>) and, subsequently, into the late embryos (
   <bold>G</bold>), which have a translucent embryo proper in the apical part and an elongated suspensor in the basal part. Afterwards, reduction in water availability and ABA treatment promotes the formation of cotyledonary embryos and their maturation. Mature embryos (
   <bold>H</bold>) are prominent and opaque embryos proper, with a manifest procambium, a well-established shoot apical meristem surrounded by a whorl of cotyledons and a well-defined root apical meristem. The suspensor cells disappear as a result of programmed cell death during late differentiation. Bar 1 cm (
   <bold>A</bold>,
