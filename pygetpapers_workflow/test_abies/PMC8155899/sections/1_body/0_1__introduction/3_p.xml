<p>Understanding the morphological and chemical heterogeneity of wood is important in its utilization, for example in the paper industry. Like wood, bark is an important source of raw material and chemical compounds [
 <xref rid="B8-polymers-13-01619" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The chemical composition of bark varies among the different tree species and depends on the morphological element involved. Many of the constituents present in wood also occur in bark, but their proportion is different. Bark can roughly be divided into the fraction: fibers, corok cells and fine substance (including parenchyma cells) [
 <xref rid="B1-polymers-13-01619" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Bark contains much more extractives than wood from the trunk [
 <xref rid="B9-polymers-13-01619" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], considerable amounts of bioactive components such as antioxidants (polyphenols), and also structural polysaccharides such as pectins [

 <xref rid="B12-polymers-13-01619" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Degradation of biomass is influenced by photodegradation (UV light), high temperatures during storage in piles, microorganizms, etc., Routa et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-polymers-13-01619" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] describe the major reactions of lipophilic extractive compounds during wood storage, which can be divided into three types: (1) hydrolysis of triglycerides (rapid reaction) and steryl esters and waxes (proceeds slower); (2) oxidation/degradation/polymerization of resin acids, unsaturated fatty acids, and to some extent, other unsaturated compounds; and (3) evaporation of volatile terpenoids, mainly monoterpenes.
