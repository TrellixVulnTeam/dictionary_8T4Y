<p>As any wood material, spruce wood is chemically complex and its physical, chemical and morphological characteristics are not uniform. In Slovakia, it is the most common wood specie. In Norway spruce, approximately 95% of wood cell matrix is composed of tracheids, which can also be termed fibers. The average tracheid length is mainly influenced by tree age. As most wood properties, fibers length and width varies greatly both within and among trees, depending on its vertical and radial position (ring age) in trunk, and forest stand [

The tracheids length is shortest next to the pith, the increase with age is at first very rapid in the juvenile period, then slow down between the ages 10â€“30 and thereafter, as mature wood begins to form, increases very gradually with seasonal fluctuation [
