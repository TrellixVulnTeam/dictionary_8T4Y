<p>The structure of wood, chemical components (cellulose, hemicelulloses, lignin and extractives) and their relative mass proportion depending on the morphological region, kind of the tree, and age of the wood [
 <xref rid="B1-polymers-13-01619" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Variation can be found within a single tree from the center of the trunk to the bark, from the trunk to the top, between earlywood and latewood, and between sapwood and heartwood [

 <xref rid="B7-polymers-13-01619" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], earlywood contains more lignin and inversely less cellulose than latewood.
