  <p>The amount of extractives is the highest in the last 25 years of growth (close to bark), polysaccharides and lignin content was similar in a cross section of trunk.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>Compared to the chemical composition of wood trunk in a different height (0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 m from the ground), very similar results of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin content were determined. The extractive content of both wood and bark is growing up with the height of the tree.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>From the view of chemical composition, the differences between bark, as a part of the trunk and the top part of the tree were obtained. In the bark top we determined bigger amount of extractives (10%) and less amount of lignin (9.5%) compared to the bark trunk. The amount of polysaccharides was similar.</p>

 <list-item>
  <p>Juvenile wood contains a smaller amount of longer fibers, &gt;1.01 mm, than other parts of the tree.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>The both average fiber length and width is higher with a height of the tree.</p>
 </list-item>

  <p>The amount of extractives is very influenced by the time of storage, especially in bark. During eight months of storage, a decreasing of extractives occurred (from 73.7 to 80.9%) and hemicelluloses (from 49.1 to 67.5%) relative content, and an increasing of lignin and cellulose. Bark stored separately degraded faster than bark stored on the trunk.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>In view of the chemical composition of the wood from the trunk retained very good durability during the storage for eight months.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>Eight months stored wood contains a lower amount of fibers, longer than 1.01 mm compared to raw wood. The both average fibers length and width decreased during storage.</p>
