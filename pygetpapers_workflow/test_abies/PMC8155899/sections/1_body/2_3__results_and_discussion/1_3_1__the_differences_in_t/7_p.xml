<p>The results of the bark analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-01619-f006">Figure 6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-01619-f007">Figure 7</xref>) show the differences mainly in fibre length distribution. The results of fibers width distribution were very similar and the largest proportion of fibers is in the class from 15.1 to 30 µm (67.53–69.17%). Bark from the trunk contains a high amount of fines (65.9%) and a lower amount of longer fibers compared to the bark from the top part of the tree. Bark contains a higher amount of shorter fibers to 0.5 mm (65.88% bark-top, 80.81% bark-trunk), than the wood part.
