 <xref rid="B32-polymers-13-01619" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] mentioned the fiber width of Norway spruce as being between 15.0 and 28.5 µm in juvenile wood, and between 29.3 and 39.7 µm in mature wood. According to our results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-01619-f006">Figure 6</xref>), the biggest content of fraction (from 45% wood-trunk to 60.85% wood-top) is in the width class from 15.1 to 30.0 µm and the average width of the wood trunk is 24.33 µm and bark 21.02 µm (
