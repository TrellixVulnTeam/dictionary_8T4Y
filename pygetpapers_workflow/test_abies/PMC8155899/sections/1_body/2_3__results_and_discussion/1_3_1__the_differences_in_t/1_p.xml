<p>Wood is composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin, and extractives. From the results of the chemical analysis of spruce wood (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-01619-f003">Figure 3</xref>), we obtained the differences between the wood, as part of the trunk, and the top part of the tree. We compared the chemical composition of the trunk part in a height of 0.5 m and 4.5 m. We have taken samples (A, B, C) from the tree trunk, as shown 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-01619-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The results indicate that there are differences in extractives content between A, B, and C in a height of 0.5 m. The biggest content of extractives, 1.68%, is in the part C (the last 25 years of growth), then A, 1.29%, and the last B, 1.04%. In a height of 4.5 m, there are no differences between the A and B part, and the amount of extractives in part C is comparable to the results in a height of 0.5 m. The amount of LIG, CEL and HEMI was very similar in a height of 0.5 and 4.5 m as well (
