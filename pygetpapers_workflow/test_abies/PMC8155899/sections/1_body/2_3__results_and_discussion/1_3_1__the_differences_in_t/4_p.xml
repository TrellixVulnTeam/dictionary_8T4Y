<p>The biggest changes in chemical composition we noticed between bark trunk and bark top (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-01619-f003">Figure 3</xref>). As mentioned above, the extractive content was higher in the bark-top (32.35%) compared to the bark-trunk (22.16%), the lignin content was higher in bark-trunk (24.97%) compared to bark-top (15.46%), and the content of polysaccharides were similar (52.87% bark-trunk and 52.18% bark-top). Neiva et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-polymers-13-01619" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] determined the lignin between 26.86% and 29.92%, and polysaccharides content between 37.86% and 52.27%, depending on the bark fraction.
