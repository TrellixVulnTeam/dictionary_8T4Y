<p>The analysis of chemical composition of wood and bark in different heights (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-01619-f003">Figure 3</xref>) exposed that the extractive content of both wood and bark is growing up with a height of the tree. The biggest extractives content of 32.35% was recorded in bark taken from the top part. Several authors mention the extractives amount of spruce bark from 23.5% to 28.3%, depending on the part of bark (inner bark from 17.3 to 38.7%, outer from 19.1 to 43.3%) [
