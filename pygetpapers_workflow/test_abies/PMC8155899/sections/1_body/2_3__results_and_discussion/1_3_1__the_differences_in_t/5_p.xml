<p>Results of the Fiber Tester analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-01619-f004">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-01619-f005">Figure 5</xref>) show that there are differences in both wood fibres length and width, mainly between samples A and B in a height of 0.5 and 4.5 m. The lower part of the trunk contains the highest amount of fines (&gt;0.3 mm), from 45.94% (part B) to 52.38% (part A). The lowest content of long fibers (more than 1.01 mm) we determined in sample 0.5-A. There are also visible differences of fibers width in this sample (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-01619-f005">Figure 5</xref>). This part of the wood contains a higher amount of narrow fibers compared to sample 4.5-A. The average fiber length depends on the part of the trunk. The results show (
 <xref rid="polymers-13-01619-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) the smallest average fiber length and width in sample A, then B, and lastly C in a height of 0.5 m and 4.5 m as well. Both average fiber length and width are larger with the height of the tree.
