<p>According to the results (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-01619-f010">Figure 10</xref> explains the results of chemical composition of wood trunk, while values are very comparable. Spruce wood retained very good durability in terms of its chemical composition after eight months of storage. Several authors studied wood with different natural aging time and the results found that the proportion of saccharides gradually decreases (mainly due to the hemicelluloses degradation), and the content of lignin increases successively with increasing time [
