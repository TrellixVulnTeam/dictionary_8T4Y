<p>The degradation of main chemical components of both bark stored separately and bark as a part of the trunk, was obvious. During eight months of storage, a decreasing of extractives occurred (bark of 80.96%, bark trunk of 73.69%) and HEMI (bark of 67.52%, bark trunk of 49%), and increasing of LIG (bark of 45.65%, bark trunk of 60.9%) and CEL (bark of 65.73% and bark trunk of 69.11%). Bergstr√∂m and Matison [
 <xref rid="B36-polymers-13-01619" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] in their study describe a decrease in the extractive content during storage, roughly halving during the first four weeks. The biggest losses noticed during this period were in the amounts of hydrophilic, and lipophilic as well. From chemical components, the stilbenes are very sensitive to degradation [

 <xref rid="B13-polymers-13-01619" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], after eight weeks of pine bark storage, we obseved types of extractive substances, which are predominate in the bark: triglycerides, steryl esters, sterols, resin acids, and fatty acids.
