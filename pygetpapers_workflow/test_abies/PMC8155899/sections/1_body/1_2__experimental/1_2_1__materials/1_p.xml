<p>Norway spruce wood (
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> L. Karst.) was harvested in the middle part of Slovakia (Zvolen region) in June. The 65-year-old tree was cut 0.5 m from the ground and its height was 25 m. For the experiment, we used a 5 m long trunk part (the diameter of 32 cm—thicker part and the diameter of 29.5 cm—thinner part) and the top part of tree, represented the waste biomass (the diameter of 12 cm—thicker part and the diameter of 7.5 cm—thinner part). We took samples (cut with an all diameter) from the trunk in a height of 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 m from the ground and both wood and bark from the top. Equally, we took samples A, B, C (
