<p>After trunk sampling, we obtained five wood pieces with a length of approximately 1 m. We debarked the first one. A part of the bark was used for the experiment and the rest for storage. The rest (four) of the wood pieces (in the bark) were also used for storage. After 2, 4, 6 and 8 months of storage, we always analysed one piece of wood (the first sample was wood and the next sample bark from this piece) and bark, which was stored separately. Specifications of the samples are described in
