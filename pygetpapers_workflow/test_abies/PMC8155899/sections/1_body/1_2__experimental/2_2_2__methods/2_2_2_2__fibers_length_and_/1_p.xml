Then, the samples were refluxed for 3 h, suction filtered through a sintered glass filter (S1), and washed with distilled water. An L &amp; W Fiber Tester (Lorenzen and Wettre, Kista, Sweden) was used to determine the fibre dimensional characteristics. This measurement is based on the principle of two-dimensional imaging technology. The measurement technology is automated, allowing for frequent and rapid analysis of the fibre quality. The instrument measures various fibre properties, such as the length and width of the fibres, fine portion (from 0.1 mm to 0.2 mm). Measurements were performed on a single replicate per sample, and the number of fibres within each population of the replicate ranged from 19,182 cells to 21,128 cells.
