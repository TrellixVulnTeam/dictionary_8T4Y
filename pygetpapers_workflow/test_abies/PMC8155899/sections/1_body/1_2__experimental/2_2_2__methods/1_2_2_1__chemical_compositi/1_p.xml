<p>The samples were disintegrated into sawdust, and fractions 0.5 mm to 1.0 mm in size were used for the chemical analyses. The extractives content (EL) was determined in a Soxhlet apparatus with a mixture of ethanol and toluene (2:1) according to ASTM D1107-96 [
 <xref rid="B16-polymers-13-01619" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The lignin content (LIG) was determined according to Sluiter et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-polymers-13-01619" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and the cellulose content (CEL) was determined according to the method by Seifert [
 <xref rid="B18-polymers-13-01619" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and the holocellulose content according to the method by Wise et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-polymers-13-01619" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Hemicelluloses (HEMI) were calculated as the difference between the holocellulose and cellulose contents. Measurements were performed on four replicates per sample. The results were presented as oven-dry wood percentages.
