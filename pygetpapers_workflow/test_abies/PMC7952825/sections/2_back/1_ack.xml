 <p>This study is dedicated to two leading personalities of the genetic research of forest trees in Slovakia: professor Ladislav Paule, who has always been (and still is) the 
  <italic>spiritus movens</italic> behind the population and evolutionary genetics research of trees and wildlife in Zvolen, and Dr. Andrej Kormuťák, who was the first to introduce marker studies in that-time Czechoslovakia, and still has remained the gravity point of tree genetics in Nitra.

 <p>The review was supported by a grant of the Slovak Grant Agency for Science VEGA 1/0029/20.</p>
