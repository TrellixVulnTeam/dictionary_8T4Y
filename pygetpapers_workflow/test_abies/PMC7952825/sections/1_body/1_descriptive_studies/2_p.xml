<p id="Par8">In Zvolen, in accordance with the university profile, initial studies were more focused on forestry-relevant issues such as the effects of management on genetic structures of forest stands or seed orchard crops, again mainly on a local scale. A study in Norway spruce (
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> Karst.) revealed that old-growth stands and naturally regenerated managed stands showed similar genetic variation levels, while stands originating from reforestation were less genetically diverse and strongly but randomly differentiated, probably due to small effective population sizes of seed sources and the resulting genetic drift (Gömöry 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1992</xref>). Studies in seed orchards revealed contrasting self-fertilization rates and levels of genetic contamination of seed crop by background pollen in European larch (
 <italic>Larix decidua</italic> Mill.) and Scots pine, resulting from different properties of pollen grains (different size and the absence of air sacks in larch; Paule and Gömöry 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">1992</xref>). The issue of seed orchard management was later revisited: effective population sizes of seed orchards of 
 <italic>Pinus</italic> sp. were assessed based on male and female flowering intensity and flowering phenology, and the effects of management measures on the genetic structures of their crops were assessed using allozyme markers (Gömöry et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2003</xref>; Machanská et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2013</xref>).
