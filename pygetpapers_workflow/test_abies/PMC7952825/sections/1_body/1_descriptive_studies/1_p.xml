<p id="Par7">Like in other cases of exploration of an unknown terrain, marker studies started with the description of variation patterns and assessment of variation levels. The very first allozyme study coming from Slovakia was that of Kormuťák (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1981</xref>) on isozyme variation in 
 <italic>Abies</italic> species. Firs, and especially silver fir (
 <italic>Abies alba</italic> Mill.) remained the main object of interest during this initial stage (Kormuťák et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1982</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1993</xref>; Matúšová 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1995</xref>; Ziegenhagen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">1996</xref>). These studies were largely restricted to the assessment of variation levels, and their very local geographical scale did not allow any deeper insights into the evolutionary context, even when such attempts were sometimes made.
