<p id="Par23">To get a deeper insight into the issue of adaptation, Sanger sequencing of candidate genes was used in 
 <italic>P. abies, F. sylvatica</italic> and 
 <italic>A. alba</italic>; candidate genes showing promising results in earlier studies were chosen; however, in different environmental contexts and under different experimental setups. Again, studies profited from the collection of materials in provenance trials and earlier scoring of growth and phenology, as well as detailed measurements of physiological traits (Romšáková et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2012</xref>; Krajmerová et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2017</xref>; Hrivnák et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2019</xref>; Konôpková et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2019</xref>). The results were not always consistent among methods (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ST</italic>
 </sub> -outlier approach vs. environmental association analysis), which is, however, quite common in this type of studies. In some genes, such as dehydrin-controlling loci, the observation of the signals of climate-driven selection at several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) was expectable and obvious (Krajmerová et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2017</xref>). In other cases, the exact mechanisms of the action of different alleles and their protein products showing significant associations with climate or adaptive phenotypic traits still need to be identified.
