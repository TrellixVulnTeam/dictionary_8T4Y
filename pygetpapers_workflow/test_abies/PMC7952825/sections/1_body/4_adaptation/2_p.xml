<p id="Par21">Industrial pollution, especially sulphur dioxide, has long been the main factor devastating forests in Central Europe. Longauer et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2001</xref>) compared genetic structures of 
 <italic>P. abies</italic>, 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> and 
 <italic>F. sylvatica</italic> in pollution-affected stands in subsets of healthy vs. declining trees. The most pronounced effects were found in spruce: paradoxically, declining trees were richer in alleles and more heterozygous than healthy trees. As the declining trees are all dead this time, this means that selection induced by pollution (in this particular case a combination of SO
 <sub>2</sub> and heavy metals) caused depletion of gene pools of the affected stands.
