<p id="Par26">Of course, NGS offers much broader possibilities than just reduced-representation sequencing. Reference genomes, indispensable for a plenty of purposes in genetic research, are still available only for a limited number of forest trees. The Zvolen lab participated in sequencing of the

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2019</xref>). Currently, a consortium of research institutions in Europe (European Reference Genome Atlas; ERGA) was established to generate reference genome assemblies for diverse European species inhabiting aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, ranging from threatened, endemic and keystone species to species of economic importance. Rapidly decreasing sequencing costs may open an opportunity window for Slovak research teams in NGS application in genome-wide association studies, identification of epigenetic changes, transcriptome analysis and other fields.
