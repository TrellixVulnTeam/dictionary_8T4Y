<p id="Par25">The progress of next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods opened much broader possibilities in all fields mentioned in the above sections, as it allowed extending the scale to the whole genome. Of course, resequencing complete genomes is still far from being an operational method of research at the population scale with a justifiable cost-benefit balance (especially not in the main European conifers with genome sizes of ~20 Gbp). Reduced-representation approaches such as restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) allows identification of 10
 <sup>4</sup>â€“10
 <sup>5</sup> SNPs regularly scattered across the genome at reasonable costs. The Zvolen lab applied double-digest RAD-Seq in evolutionary studies in 
 <italic>Alnus glutinosa</italic> (L.) Gaertn, 
 <italic>F. sylvatica</italic> or 
 <italic>P. abies</italic>, whereas phylogeny, genomic architecture in hybrid zones, and climatic and edaphic adaptation are the targeted phenomena. Although travel limitations associated with the Covid-19 crisis hampered completing the materials collection and finalizing the results in terms of publication, preliminary results indicate that in all studied species, SNPs of adaptive value can be identified.
