<p id="Par4">In Slovakia (more exactly, Czechoslovakia), the boom of marker studies was seized quite early: the first isozyme lab dealing with trees was established at the Institute of Dendrobiology of the Slovak Academy of Sciences in Mly≈àany in mid-1980s, (later moved to Institute of Plant Genetics and Biotechnology in Nitra), and with a small delay, another lab at the University of Forestry and Wood Technology in Zvolen (today Technical University in Zvolen) followed. At the Forestry Research Institute in Zvolen, a separate research group was established, although technically dependent on the university lab. Later, allozymes have become gradually replaced by various types of DNA markers.</p>
