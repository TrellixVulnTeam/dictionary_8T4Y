<p id="Par3">The problem of common-garden experiments is that the commonly assessed phenotypic traits are typically complex, polygenic, and are affected by the environment, which cannot be fully controlled in field experiments; therefore, they cannot be used to detect genetic variation at the genic level. With the development of the methods of electrophoretic separation of proteins, analysis of allelic variants at genes controlling the synthesis of enzymes (isoenzymes/isozymes/allozymes) became the first widespread tool (Feret and Bergmann
