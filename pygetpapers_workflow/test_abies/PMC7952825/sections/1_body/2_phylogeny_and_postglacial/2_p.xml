<p id="Par10">When at the beginning of 2000s, the 5th FP EU project Fossilva was organized, aiming at the reconstruction of Holocene migration of main European tree species based on the combination of paleobotanical and genetic methods, the 
 <italic>F. sylvatica</italic> allozyme dataset, along with a similar dataset on 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> gathered at the Forestry Research Institute, Zvolen, were included in the analyses. In contrast with earlier assumptions, both types of data showed that the principal glacial refugia, from which the major part of distribution ranges of temperate tree species were colonized, were not located in the very southern parts of the main European southern peninsulas (Balkans, Apennine and Iberian) but farther in the North. In the case of beech, the main refugium was situated at the eastern foothills of the Alps, from where beech migrated to almost the whole current range. The spread from refugia in Italy and southern Balkans was blocked by large river valleys (Po, Danube). The refugia at the French Mediterranean coast started to expand too late (6â€“7 ky), the surrounding areas were already colonized by the Slovenian/Istrian genetic lineage. Finally, the refugia in the Cantabrian mountains (documented by macrofossils, pollen record as well as allozyme data) did not expand at all, their population sizes were probably too small and the resulting genetic drift may have depleted their gene pools of adaptively important alleles; they were overlaid by newcomers from the main refugium (Magri et al.
