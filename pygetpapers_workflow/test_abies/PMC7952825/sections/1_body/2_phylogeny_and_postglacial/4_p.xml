<p id="Par12">In the genus 
 <italic>Abies</italic>, species richness in the Mediterranean area is especially high in the eastern part. There is, however, no unanimity about taxonomical treatment of local populations. The species status of 
 <italic>A. nordmanniana</italic> (Steven) Spach and 
 <italic>A. cilicica</italic> (Antoine &amp; Kotschy) Carr. is undisputed, while 
 <italic>A. equi-trojani</italic> Asch. et Sint. ex Boiss. and 
 <italic>A. bornmuelleriana</italic> Mattf. are considered separate species by local botanists but later revised as subspecies of 
 <italic>A. nordmanniana</italic> by Coode and Cullen (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1965</xref>). Phylogeny of this complex was studied by Hrivnák et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2017</xref>) using nuclear microsatellites (eastern lineage of 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> Mill. and 
 <italic>A. cephalonica</italic> Loud. were included for comparison). ABC simulations showed that 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> and 
 <italic>A. nordmanniana</italic> diverged from the common ancestor 3.73 My BP. 
 <italic>A. bornmuelleriana</italic> split from the southern 
 <italic>A. nordmanniana</italic> lineage 3.08 My BP, i.e., both events occurred still in the Pliocene. In 
 <italic>A. nordmanniana</italic>, two genetic lineages were revealed (cryptic subspecies), separated by the ridge of the Grand Caucasus, which diverged 692 ky BP. Finally, 
 <italic>A. equi-trojani</italic> appeared 621 ky BP, i.e., in the Early Pleistocene. Divergence times indicate that 
 <italic>A. bornmuelleriana</italic> would deserve species rather than subspecies status. Meanwhile the two subspecies of 
 <italic>A. cilicica</italic> showed a level of genetic differentiation even higher than for the other studied species – on the other hand, ABC simulations showed divergence of the two subspecies at 695 ky BP, conforming to the level of subspecies in this study.
