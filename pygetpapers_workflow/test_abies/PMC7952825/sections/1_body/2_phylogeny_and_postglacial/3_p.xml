<p id="Par11">The migration history of silver fir is partly different. Principal refugia contributing to the colonization of the current range were located in northern Apennines and southern Balkans; allozyme data suggest a third important refugium in northwestern Balkans, but this is not sufficiently documented by the fossil record (Liepelt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2009</xref>). Maternally inherited mitochondrial markers allowed tracing the migration trails quite in detail: the Pannonian lowland forms a large gap in the distribution of fir, the contact zone east of this gap (the Carpathians) was found to be very short (~70 km) and mixed-haplotype populations are found only in the close proximity of the boundary between mitochondrial lineages. On the other hand, the boundary in the West (the Dinarians) is long and complicated, when the Balkan lineage migrated along the coast even up to northeastern Italy, while the Central-European lineage colonized the interior until eastern Bosnia (Gömöry et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2004</xref>). Origin from different refugia has also practical implications: dendrochronological analyses documented that genetic lineages differ in growth patterns, resulting from different sensitivity to climate and industrial pollution (Bošeľa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>).
