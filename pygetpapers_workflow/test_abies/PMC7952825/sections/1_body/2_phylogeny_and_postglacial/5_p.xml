<p id="Par13">On a genus-wide scale, phylogeny of 
 <italic>Abies</italic> was addressed in a PCR-RFLP study of chloroplast DNA by Kormuťák et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2004</xref>), covering 15 Asian, 6 North-American and 7 Mediterranean species. The analysis revealed a strong divergence of the Mediterranean group from the rest, differentiation within the North-American group (especially between sections 
 <italic>Balsameae</italic> and 
 <italic>Grandes</italic>), and less variation among the Asian firs, with the exception of
