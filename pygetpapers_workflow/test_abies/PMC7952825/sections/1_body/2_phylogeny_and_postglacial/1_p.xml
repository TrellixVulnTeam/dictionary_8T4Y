<p id="Par9">For the research group in Zvolen, beech taxa in western Eurasia (
 <italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic> L. 
 <italic>sensu</italic>
 <italic>lato</italic>) have been a favourite object of interest since the early 1990s, when a large-scale monitoring of genetic variation of this species started in cooperation with University of Bordeaux, France. Through international collaboration and own collections, a set of 280 population samples covering the eastern half of the distribution of 
 <italic>F. sylvatica</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>sylvatica</italic> (European beech) and the whole range of 
 <italic>F. sylvatica</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>orientalis</italic> (eastern or oriental beech) was assembled and analyzed by allozyme markers. The resulting studies revealed that oriental beech is incomparably more differentiated and more diverse than European beech and is composed of three geographically separated genetic lineages, distributed in the Alborz Mts. in Iran, the Caucasus and the Asia Minor (extending to eastern Greece and Bulgaria), European beech being genetically most proximate to the Turkish lineage. A substantially higher allelic richness in oriental beech is an indication that the Pleistocene glaciations affected its gene pool less severely than European beech (Gömöry et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007</xref>; Gömöry and Paule 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2010</xref>). On the other hand, climatic fluctuations during the Pliocene and the Pleistocene caused expansions and retreats of distribution ranges, accompanied by contacts and hybridization between regional genetic lineages; the most prominent example is beech in Crimea, sometimes considered a separate taxon 
 <italic>F. taurica</italic> Popl. Subsequent development of mathematical and informatics tools allowed explicit testing of phylogenetic scenarios for this taxonomical complex by Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). The best-supported scenario placed the splits of genetic lineages of oriental beech into the Early Pleistocene (1.62–1.87 My), while the clade leading to European beech diverged from the Turkish lineage at 1.18 My. The hybrid origin of Crimean beech from the hybridization between the Caucasian and the European lineage was confirmed, the timing of this event being 144 ky (Late Pleistocene). On the other hand, another suspected hybrid lineage, the Balkan beech (treated as separate taxon 
 <italic>F. moesiaca</italic> Czeczott by local botanists) is just a separate clade diverged from the Turkish lineage during the Cromer interglacial (817 ky), and the current European beech occupying a major part of Europe split from the Balkan lineage at the beginning of the Weichsel/Würm glacial (96 ky) (Gömöry et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2018</xref>).
