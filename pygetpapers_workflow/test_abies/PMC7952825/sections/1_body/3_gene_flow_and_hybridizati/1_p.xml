<p id="Par15">Hybridization has always been a high-priority topic for the research team in Mlyňany/Nitra. The initial object of interest was the genus 
 <italic>Abies</italic>, where pioneering work has been done in artificial hybridization, profiting from rich resources of the Arboretum Mlyňany (Kormuťák 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1985</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2004</xref>; Kormuťák et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2008b</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2013</xref>). Cytological aspects of interspecific hybridization in firs were studied as well (Kormuťák 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1986</xref>; Kormuťák et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2002</xref>). Genetic markers (allozymes, PCR-RFLP cpDNA) were initially used just to verify the hybrid status of the offspring (Kormuťák et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1992</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1993</xref>) and to confirm paternal inheritance of plastids (Salaj et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">1998</xref>). Later, the focus shifted to natural hybridization of pines, mainly the studies of hybrid swarms of 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic> L. and 
 <italic>P. mugo</italic> Turra. Again, PCR-RFLP cpDNA markers were initially used for validation of hybrid status and quantification of hybrid seeds in open-pollinated progenies collected in nature (Kormuťák et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2005</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2008a</xref>; Maňka et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2015</xref>). However, development and verification of species-specific cpDNA markers combined with nuclear markers and morphometry allowed assessing the degree and direction of introgression and revealed maternal inheritance of plastid DNA in 
 <italic>P. mugo</italic> × 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic> crosses, which is exceptional in the Pinaceae (Kormuťák et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2017</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2018</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2020</xref>).
