<p id="Par19">There is a striking difference in the geographical patterns of hybrid zones between wind-dispersed and animal-dispersed species. In both above cases (representing wind-dispersed trees), the contact zone is not necessarily straight but it is always sharp: populations mixed of representatives of both maternal lineages are very scarce and appear just in the closest vicinity of the contact line. This suggests that the colonization fronts in anemochorous species are typically compact, and when they meet, gene flow by seeds across the meeting line is very limited, while a further movement of the colonization front is blocked. In contrast, in zoochorous trees such as beech or oaks, colonization is accomplished by long-distance dispersal events, when a few beechnuts or acorns are transported far from the colonization front (usually by birds), buried or lost, and give rise to a new local subpopulation. The outcome of this dispersal strategy is a broad hybrid zone, where pure patches of the either haplotype alternate (Magri et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2006</xref>). In oaks, the same haplotype is even shared across species (Petit et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">1997</xref>).
