<p id="Par17">Genetic architecture of hybrid zones is another topic associated with gene exchange between differentiated genetic lineages. As stated above, there is a plenty of contact lines between ranges of different but interfertile species or intraspecific genetic lineages originating for instance from different refugia. One of them is the contact zone of 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cephalonica</italic> in southern Balkans, forming a hybrid taxon 
 <italic>A. borisii-regis</italic> Mattf. Krajmerová et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2016</xref>) studied this zone employing a combination of a maternally inherited mitochondrial marker and nuclear microsatellites. The distribution of maternal lineages (reflecting colonization by seed dispersal) showed a sharp boundary between the 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cephalonica</italic> lineages around 39.10°N, while the latitudinal cline is very steep (width of 0.20° ≈ 22 km). In contrast, distribution of nuclear gene pools (reflecting gene flow by pollen) suggests a broad introgression zone with a centre at 40.14°N and width of 2.32° ≈ 255 km. As no gene or gene pool specific for 
 <italic>A. borisii-regis</italic> was found, this taxon represents a hybrid swarm rather than a separate species.
