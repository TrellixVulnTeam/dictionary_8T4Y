<p id="Par16">Another species-rich taxon characterized by high levels of interspecific gene flow is oaks. In Slovakia, the species of 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> L. subg. 
 <italic>Lepidobalanus</italic> (Endl.) Oerst. share substantial parts of their genomes. A combination of morphometry and allozyme analysis in mixed populations showed that even individuals unambiguously classified as 
 <italic>Q. robur</italic> L. based on morphological traits may contain up to 90% of genes typical for 
 <italic>Q. petraea</italic> (Matt.) Liebl. and vice versa; to a lesser extent, this is true also for 
 <italic>Q. pubescens</italic> Willd. (Gömöry and Schmidtová 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007</xref>). Whether this is a result of sharing ancestral polymorphisms or recent gene flow is still a matter of controversy (Muir and Schlötterer 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2005</xref> vs. Lexer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2006</xref>). Anyway, not all portions of the genome show identical levels of interspecific differentiation: while in most allozyme genes, the differentiation is very small, the gene for glucose dehydrogenase exhibited coefficient of differentiation of 0.47. Taking into account contrasting ecological requirement of sessile vs. pedunculate oak, such skewed distribution of the coefficient of differentiation suggests that the gene in question may either be under selection pressure itself or be linked to adaptively significant genes (Gömöry et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2001</xref>).
