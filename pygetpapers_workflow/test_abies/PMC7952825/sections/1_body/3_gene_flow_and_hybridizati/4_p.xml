<p id="Par18">The contact zone of genetic lineages coming from the Balkan and Central-European refugia may serve as another example. Liepelt et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2002</xref>) treated the whole central Europe as a single hybrid zone between these lineages, forgetting the fact that the Pannonian plane did not harbour any fir populations during the last glacial and the Holocene, and colonization appeared along separate migration trails east and west of this hiatus. This led to unrealistically high estimates of longitudinal cline widths both for seed-dispersed mitochondrial genes (1.72° ≈ 130 km) and pollen-dispersed chloroplast genes (25.47° ≈ 1990 km). A re-analysis of the eastern (Carpathian) contact zone by Gömöry et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2012a</xref>) showed cline width better comparable with 
 <italic>A. borisii-regis</italic> (18 km and 120 km for seed and pollen dispersal, respectively). Moreover, clines in another anemochorous tree, 
 <italic>Fraxinus excelsior</italic> L, were comparably wide (36 km and 275 km for seed and pollen dispersal, respectively) (Gömöry et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012b</xref>).
