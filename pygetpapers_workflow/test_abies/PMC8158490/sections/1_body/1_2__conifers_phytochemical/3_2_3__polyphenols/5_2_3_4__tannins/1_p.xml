<p>Tannins are polyphenolic compounds that can be in a wide range of plants. Tannins are colored pigments, astringent and are characterized by a bitter taste [

 <xref rid="B78-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. As a result, the tannins can be divided into four main classes based on their structural characteristics: gallotannins, complex tannins, ellagitannins and condensed tannins [
