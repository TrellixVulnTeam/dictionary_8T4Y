<p>Flavonoids are the most abundant phenol group in nature, present in a wide range of conifers [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Flavonoids have a central three-ring structure, but the different subclasses vary due to the centrally located heterocyclic ring structure (C-ring), which connects the two benzene rings [
 <xref rid="B72-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. To date, more than 6000 flavonoids have been recorded in several studies from plants. Flavonoids are aglycones in their basic structure, but most of them are glycosides in plants [
