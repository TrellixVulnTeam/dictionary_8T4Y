<p>There are several classes of alkaloids which are classified on the basis of the heterocyclic ring system and biosynthetic precursor which are of great interest. The alkaloids comprise quinolizidines, indoles, tropanes, pyrrolidines, pyrrolizidines, imidazoles, piperidines and isoquinoline purines [
