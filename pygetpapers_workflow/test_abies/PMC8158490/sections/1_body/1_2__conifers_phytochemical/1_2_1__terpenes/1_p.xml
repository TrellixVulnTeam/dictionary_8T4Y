<p>Terpenes are isoprenoids not containing nitrogen and sulfur and seem to be the main and largest group of natural phytochemicals group in conifers [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The terpenoids can be classified as C5 (hemiterpenes), C15 (sesquiterpenes), C20 (diterpenes), C10 (monoterpenes), C25 (sesterpenes), C40 (tetraterpenes), C40 (polyterpenes), and C30 (triterpenes) on the basis of C5 units [

 <xref rid="molecules-26-03005-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> represents the most common mono-, sesqui- and diterpenes present in conifers. In particular, monoterpenes have been extensively studied, especially for their antiviral properties. Further, Porres-Mart√≠nez et al. (2016) reported their biological activities, including the anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects [
