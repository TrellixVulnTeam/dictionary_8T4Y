<p>In recent years, there has been increased interest in secondary metabolites with potential larvicidal activity in a number of countries around the world [
 <xref rid="B258-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">258</xref>]. Dengue fever, yellow fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, malaria and chikungunya are the most severe diseases transmitted by mosquitoes. 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is one of the mosquito species involved in the transmission of such vector disease outbreaks [

 <xref rid="B259-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">259</xref>]. Larvicidal activity has been documented in extracts of conifer spp. parts [
 <xref rid="B260-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">260</xref>]. The mosquito control technique is determined by the larval stages (egg, larvae, pupae, and adult) of the target. Mosquito control methods include spraying chemical insecticides on adult mosquitoes or destroying mosquito larvae before they grow into adults, either by means of synthetic larvicides or by using botanical extracts as an alternative larvicide [
 <xref rid="B258-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">258</xref>]. The use of these synthetic insecticides against mosquitoes creates insecticide resistance as well as multifarious problems, such as environmental pollution and poisonous hazards to human beings [
 <xref rid="B261-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">261</xref>]. These plant-oriented natural products are eco-friendly in nature and are preferred for use against larvae over other synthetic insecticides [
 <xref rid="B262-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">262</xref>]. Based on mortality, the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>J. procera</italic> and 
 <italic>T. orientalis</italic> leaves has potential against 
 <italic>Anopheles arabiensis</italic>, 
 <italic>A. stephensi</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> larvae [

 <xref rid="B263-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">263</xref>]. It also has been found that 
 <italic>C. sempervirens</italic> petroleum ether leaves extract shows a toxic effect on 
 <italic>Musca domestica</italic> larva and also causes a decrease in the production of eggs and fecundity, as well as inducing sterility in both males and females [
 <xref rid="B264-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">264</xref>]. Ethanol extract of 
 <italic>Pinus caribaea</italic> and 
 <italic>P. merkusii</italic> leaves and bark exhibited the highest mortality in the larvae of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic>, a vector responsible for dengue fever transmission [
