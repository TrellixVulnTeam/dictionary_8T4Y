<p>Epilepsy is a neurological condition that affects people of all ages all over the world. The side effects of antiepileptic drugs and their connection to oxidative stress have prompted researchers to look for new medications that are less expensive and that have fewer side effects [

 <italic>C. deodara</italic> wood and 
 <italic>P. roxburghii</italic> bark have historically been used to treat neurological disorders. In this analysis, the anticonvulsant activity of 3,4-bis(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)furan-2,5-dione (BDFD) isolated from the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>C. deodara</italic> and quercetin, chlorogenic acid, and rutin isolated from the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>P. roxburghii</italic> bark were assessed in mice, and the results demonstrate modulation in the function of glutamate receptors by enhancing inhibitory GABA minergic neurotransmission [
