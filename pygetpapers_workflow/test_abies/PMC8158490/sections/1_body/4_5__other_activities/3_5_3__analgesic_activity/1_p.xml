<p>Analgesia/pain is an intense, ill-defined feeling triggered by a stimulus (external/internal); it is the most significant symptom that serves as an alarm signal and is mainly defensive in nature [
 <xref rid="B232-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">232</xref>]. Bradykinin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and ILs cause analgesia by blocking the pain nerve sensitizing pathway [
 <xref rid="B233-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>]. An analgesic is a drug that relieves pain by acting on pain mechanisms in the CNS or in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) without affecting consciousness [

Even after new advances in pain therapies, healthcare professionals still need safe, reliable, and effective analgesic drugs to treat a variety of painful conditions, especially chronic pain. Based on its traditional medicinal uses, isolated 
 <italic>T. wallichiana</italic> constituents are widely explored for analgesic purposes [

 <italic>C. deodara</italic> methanol bark extract was observed in Albino rats with acetic acid-induced writhing and found that it had a major analgesic effect, with 55.8% defense at a dose of 100 mg/kg [
 <xref rid="B159-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. In the acetic acid-induced writhing and hot plate model, 
 <italic>Cupressus</italic> flavanone (CUF) demonstrated significant analgesic activity. At the three CUF doses used, 160 mg/kg in 120 min prevented PG synthesis and writhing response in mice at a rate of 25, 48, and 62%, respectively [
