<p>Conifer compounds act as antimicrobials because they have potential in degrading microbial cell walls: disruption to the cytoplasmic membrane and membrane proteins, cell leakage, cytoplasm coagulation, and proton motive force depletion are all examples of their inhibitory action [
 <xref rid="B254-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">254</xref>]. The following is a list in descending order of the key bioactive compounds responsible for antimicrobial effects: ketones &gt; alcohols &gt; esters &gt; hydrocarbons &gt; aldehydes &gt; ketones &gt; alcohols &gt; esters &gt; hydrocarbons [
 <xref rid="B255-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">255</xref>]. Terpenoid compounds (α-terpineol, δ--3-carene, geranyl acetate, borneol, α and β-pinene, limonene, α-terpinene, ϒ-terpinene, β-ocimene, bornyl acetate, 1,8-cineole, α-phellandrene, p-cymene, linalool, ϒ-muurolene, α-humulene, and cadinene) have been found to be responsible for antimicrobial activity [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Alkaloids, especially 1,6-dehydropinidine obtained from 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> needle and bark, have recently been discovered to have antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Streptococcus equi</italic> (MIC = 55 g/mL) [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Secoisolariciresinol, pinoresinol, eudesmin, lariciresinol, and lariciresinol-4-methyl ether isolated from 
 <italic>A. araucana</italic> wood methanol extract have shown potent antibacterial and antifungal activity with a synergistic effect, enhancing their potency against bacteria and fungi [
 <xref rid="B256-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">256</xref>]. Anti-herpes activity was found in hydroethanolic extract ethyl acetate (EA) and n-butanol (NB) fractions from 
 <italic>A. angustifolia</italic> leaves, indicating that conifer spp. could have been used in folk medicine to treat viruses [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. It has been reported that RV, piceatannol, hydroxystilbenes and isorhapontigenin are present in debarking water, a byproduct of debarking logs of 
 <italic>P. abies</italic>, meaning that it has the potential to prevent the growth of a variety of fungi and may be used as a natural fungicide [
