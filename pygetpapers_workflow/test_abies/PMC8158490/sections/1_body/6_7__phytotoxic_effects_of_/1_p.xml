<p>Despite all of the advances stated so far, toxicity studies are required to know the effective doses that could be administered subsequently, as well as to depict the potential clinical signs elicited by the plant material [

 <italic>T. baccata, P. contorta</italic> and 
 <italic>J. communis</italic> needles. A study was performed on a sample collected from a fatal case of a 22-year-old man, which revealed the presence of taxol A, diterpenoids such as monoacetyltaxine, and cardiotoxic compounds, such as 10-deacetylbaccatin III and taxine B. These compounds bind to calcium channels in cardiac myocytes, causing nausea, seizures, vomiting, dizziness, several cardiovascular effects, including bradycardia, and leading to ventricular tachycardia with severe ventricular arrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation and abdominal pain [
