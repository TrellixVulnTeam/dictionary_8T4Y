<p>Bioactive molecules have been recognized for their valuable biological effects, including neuroprotective properties, such as the ability to regulate mitochondria in a way that is distinct from TMs [
 <xref rid="B183-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>]. Branco et al. (2018) found that the flavonoid-rich 
 <italic>A. angustifolia</italic> bracts extract (AAE) has neuroprotective properties by restoring rotenone-induced mitochondrial complex I, inhibiting the formation of lipid peroxidation and neuronal ROS, and through over expression of NDUFS7 protein and NDUFV2 gene levels in human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells [
