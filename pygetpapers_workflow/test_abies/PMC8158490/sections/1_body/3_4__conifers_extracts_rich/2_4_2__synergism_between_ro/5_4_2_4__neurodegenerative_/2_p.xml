<p>Neurotrophins avoid neuron degeneration by binding to and activating the Trk receptor family, which is located in the plasma membrane [
 <xref rid="B177-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>]. Neurotrophins work by binding to and activating the Trk receptor family, which is found in the plasma membrane, to prevent neuron degeneration. Since neurotrosphins bind to Trk receptors, they create a microenvironment that promotes neuron development [
 <xref rid="B180-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>]. Various intracellular signaling pathways, such as ERK and PI3k/AKT, are regulated as a result of this binding, allowing cells to survive and aiding in the recovery of neurons from neurodegeneration. Additionally to signaling pathway activation, neurotrophins support Bcl-2 gene expression, which inhibits intracellular apoptosis [
