While behavioral therapy, psychotherapy and light therapy have all been used to treat insomnia, the most common medications for insomnia are hypnotic drugs that target GABAA-benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors, such as diazepam and zolpidem [

 <italic>Pinus</italic> spp., α-pinene and 3-carene, have been reported to have hypnotic effects through GABAA-BZD receptors. 3-carene increases the length of sleep in mice given pentobarbital-induced sleep drugs by binding to the BZD site of the GABAA-BZD receptor α1 and ϒ2 [
