<p>1. Soxhlet extraction: The Soxhlet extraction method is a more efficient extraction method with high extraction yield and requires less solvent and time. This method requires electricity and solvents such as methanol, petroleum ether, and acetonitrile for the extraction process. However, sometimes high temperature and long extraction time enhance the possibility of thermal degradation and the loss of bioactive compound fraction activity [
