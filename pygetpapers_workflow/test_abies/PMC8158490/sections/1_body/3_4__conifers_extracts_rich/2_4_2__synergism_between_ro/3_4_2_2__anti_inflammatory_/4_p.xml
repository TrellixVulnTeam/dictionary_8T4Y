<p>3. Maceration: Maceration is carried out at room temperature by soaking the material with the solvent with eventual stirring. It has the advantage of moderate extraction conditions but suffers from high solvent consumption, long extraction times and low extraction yields. It could be used for the extraction of thermo labile components. </p>
