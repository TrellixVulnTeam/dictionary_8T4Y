<p>When contagious microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria and viruses come into contact with the body, they remain in specific tissues and flow into the bloodstream, causing inflammation [
 <xref rid="B105-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. This also occurs as an end result of tissue damage, cancer, cell death, degeneration and ischemia [
 <xref rid="B106-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>,
 <xref rid="B107-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>,
 <xref rid="B108-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. In most cases, both the innate and adaptive immune responses are responsible for inflammation development [
 <xref rid="B109-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. The primary protection against invading foreign microbodies and cancer cells is the innate immune system, which involves macrophages, dendritic cells, and mast cells [
 <xref rid="B105-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. In the adaptive immune system, specialized cells (B and T cells) remove foreign pathogens and cancer cells by generating specific receptors and antibodies [
 <xref rid="B110-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Cytokines such as interleukins, interferons, tumor necrosis factor, eicosanoids (leukotrienes and prostaglandins), modulatory inflammation-transcription nuclear factor (NF-ĸB) and chemokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1), are the inflammatory mediators and cellular pathways that have been extensively studied in relation to human pathological conditions [
 <xref rid="B111-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is secreted by a variety of cells and has a variety of cellular effects [
 <xref rid="B112-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. It has also been linked to a variety of human illnesses, including cancer, mental and skin disorders, immune and inflammatory diseases. IL-1 is another cytokine that primarily has a pro-inflammatory effect [
 <xref rid="B113-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. It raises the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, TNF and IL-6 [
 <xref rid="B114-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. On the other hand, IL-1 has been linked to anti-inflammatory properties. Likewise, IL-1α and IL-6 originating from activated mast cells in the innate immune response also boost acute phase protein synthesis and thus show some anti-inflammatory effects [
 <xref rid="B115-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. The cytokine family members, including IL-12, IL-27, IL-23 and IL-35, function as a pro- and anti-inflammatory response [
 <xref rid="B111-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>,
 <xref rid="B116-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>,
 <xref rid="B117-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. On the other hand, IL-10 has been recognized as an effective anti-inflammatory cytokine, and helps in preventing several pro-inflammatory mediators from further action [
 <xref rid="B118-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. It protects tissue from homeostasis, defends against injury and damage caused by an overactive inflammatory response [

 <xref rid="B119-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>,
 <xref rid="B120-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. TNF-α accelerates PGE2 synthesis changes caused by edema and the flow of blood [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The extraction of plant materials is the first step in deciding the plant biological activities. The is a high probability of synergism between bioactive components when a whole extract is used, which could be lost if each and every component is isolated [
 <xref rid="B121-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. This form of synergism has been documented in numerous medical studies, generally for anti-inflammatory function [
 <xref rid="B105-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. There are different types of extraction and separation processes, such as:
