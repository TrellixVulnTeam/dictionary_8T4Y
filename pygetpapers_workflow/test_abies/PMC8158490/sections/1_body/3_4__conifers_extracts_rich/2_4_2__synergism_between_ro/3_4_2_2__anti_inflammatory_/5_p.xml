<p>4. Ultrasound-assisted extraction: In UAE, the plant material, usually in a glass container, is covered by the extraction solvent and put into an ultrasonic bath. It decreases extraction time and improves extraction yields due to mechanical stress, which induces cavitation and cellular breakdown, and has gained increasing popularity [

After isolation to concentrate the extract, many researchers used a rotary evaporator, a normal air-drying process and distillation methods. Generally, to separate different solvent extracts, a separatory funnel is required [
