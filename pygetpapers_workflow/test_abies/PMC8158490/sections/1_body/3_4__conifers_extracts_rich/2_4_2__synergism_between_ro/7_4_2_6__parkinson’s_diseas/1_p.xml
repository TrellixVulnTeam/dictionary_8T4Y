<p>PD is second to AD in terms of the most prevalent progressive ND, with an estimated global prevalence of over 10,000,000 cases [
 <xref rid="B201-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>]. The selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) leads to PD. Briefly, PD occurs due to oxidative stress, dysfunction of mitochondrial complex-1, oxidative cell damage, neuronal excitotoxicity, calcium homeostasis, apoptosis, distressed energy metabolism, inflammation and protein aggregation, such as a-synuclein, apoptosis, and interaction between genetic and environmental causes [
 <xref rid="B202-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>]. Due to uncoordinated mouth and throat movements, PD causes bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, rest tremor, and the loss of postural control, as well as certain secondary symptoms, such as dementia, sialorrhea, soft voice, and trouble swallowing [

 <xref rid="B204-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>]. Oxidative stress generates ROS that causes oxidative damage, such as 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), 26S proteasome and interferes with dopamine metabolism leading to PD [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Changes in protein ubiquitination and degradation have recently been related to dopaminergic cell death in PD [
 <xref rid="B205-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>]. Presynaptic protein α-synuclein (α-syn) influences the release of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles in the brain [
 <xref rid="B206-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. Currently, the treatment of PD includes drugs such as L-DOPA, which is catalyzed primarily by dopa decarboxylase in the brain, and some others such as ropinirole, selegiline, and rasagiline. Ropinirole has some adverse effects, including ankle oedema, vomiting, nausea, hypotension, insomnia, weight loss, hallucinations, psychosis, arrhythmia, dry mouth, nightmares, persistent diarrhea, somnolence and constipation, limiting their clinical applications [
 <xref rid="B207-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>]. As a result, the focus of rising interest in alternative treatments for ND, such as PD, has turned to natural products, which can provide alternatives due to their high effectiveness and few side effects [
 <xref rid="B208-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>]. Many plant extracts tend to stop α-syn from oligomerization and fibrillation, which is an emerging therapeutic mechanism in PD [

 <italic>J. communis</italic> at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg was found to be effective in reducing catalepsy, enhancing locomotor activity (actophotometer), and increasing the level of reduced glutathione (GSH), protein level and muscle activity in rats [
 <xref rid="B209-molecules-26-03005" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>]. In an in vitro study on Fisher F344 rats, Zhang et al. (2010) discovered that RV protect dopaminergic neurons from damage caused by MPP+, 6-OHDA, and also show efficacy against lipopolysaccharide-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling and microglial activation [
