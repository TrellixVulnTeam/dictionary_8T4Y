<p>Genome mining using antiSMASH v5.0. (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and RAST (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) revealed multiple genes associated with plant growth promotion, including siderophore biosynthesis- and phytohormone-associated genes. AntiSMASH v5.0 predicted 16 putative secondary metabolite gene clusters for synthesis of antimicrobial compounds, including paeninodin, bacitracin, paenilipoheptin, xenocoumacin, pellasoren, and octapeptin. The complete genome sequence of this strain will support future studies to determine the mechanisms underpinning the plant growth-promoting activity of this isolate and expand the genomic information currently available on plant growth-promoting bacteria.
