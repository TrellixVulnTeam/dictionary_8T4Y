<p>The study of deadwood fungal community composition in the natural firâ€“beech Carpathian forest of Salajka across &gt;40 years of decay showed that wood pH and wood C/N played a determinant role. A decrease in C/N promotes both fungal wood colonization and enzymatic activity, while pH and C/N are the main drivers of the fungal community composition. Among the vast diversity of fungi colonizing the CWD, most of the dominant fungi were common to both 
 <italic>F. sylvatica</italic> and 
 <italic>A. alba</italic>. The dissimilarities between communities in both tree species are mostly due to rare and specialist fungal species, highlighting the importance of tree species diversity to enhance fungal diversity in forest ecosystems. The abundance of approximately half of the dominant fungal taxa involved in deadwood decomposition was significantly affected by pH, C/N and/or their interaction. However, the responses of these taxa to pH and C/N were variable, suggesting a difference in the response of these taxa to future decreases in the pH of forest soils or increases in N deposition. In the context of current and future global changes affecting forests, additional studies on the responses of dominant fungi combined with the study of environmental conditions will be required to predict the changes that could occur at the level of deadwood decomposition.
