<p>Notably, the fungal community composition of both tree species tended to be similar in the young CWD and showed divergent development in later stages. Previous studies demonstrated that tree species were the main driver of the fungal community composition in deadwood [

 <xref rid="B16-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Here, we identified wood chemistry, mainly pH and C/N, as the main drivers of fungal community composition. Thus, the similarities in pH and C/N in the young CWD that we observed could explain the similarities in the fungal communities during these early stages. According to our findings, the differences in fungal communities between both tree species affected rare fungal species because most of the dominant fungal taxa were common to both tree species. These rare species might be mainly specialists, i.e., tree species-specific, as demonstrated by Moor et al. [
