<p>Finally, considering CWD from the same tree species and similar decay length but from two forests approximately 300 km from each other [
 <xref rid="B18-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we found different dominant taxa. Indeed, Baldrian et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] studied the fungal community in deadwood of 
 <italic>F. sylvatica</italic> and 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> in the Zofin natural forest, which has quite similar vegetation and climatic conditions as the Salajka forest [
 <xref rid="B36-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Certain taxa, e.g., 
 <italic>Fomes fomentarius</italic>, 
 <italic>Resinicium furfuraceum</italic>, 
 <italic>Kretzschmaria deusta</italic> and 
 <italic>Eutypa spinosa</italic>, were dominant in both forests, but several of the most commonly appearing, quantitatively dominant fungi were limited to Salajka: 
 <italic>Mycena purpureofusca</italic>, 
 <italic>M. romagnesiana</italic>, 
 <italic>Camarops sp</italic>. and 
 <italic>Mycetinis alliaceus</italic>. If spatial distances &lt;20 km do not seem to strongly affect fungal communities [
 <xref rid="B12-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], we show that beta diversity over distances of several tens to hundreds of km is high. Local climatic or edaphic differences between regions may explain this result. Climate has been shown to be the main driver of the global distribution of fungi [
 <xref rid="B84-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. In our study, the regional effect could be partly due to the difference in precipitation between the Salajka and Zofin forests [
 <xref rid="B87-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Błonska et al. [
 <xref rid="B4-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] found that humidity can affect the amount of N and C in deadwood, which can affect the composition of the fungal community. In addition, Přívětivý et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] also demonstrated distinct rates of deadwood decomposition between Salajka and Zofin due to moisture differences. These observations underline the importance of protecting natural forests at multiple locations for the preservation of rare or locally endemic fungi. It should be noted that preservation of deadwood in forests is equally essential for fungal protection since deadwood fungal communities show little overlap with other habitats, including litter and soil [
 <xref rid="B88-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], and a reduction in deadwood content may cause the loss of rare fungal taxa.
