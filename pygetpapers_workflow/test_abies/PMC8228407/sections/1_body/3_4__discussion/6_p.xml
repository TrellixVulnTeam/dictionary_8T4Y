<p>Among the 208 most abundant fungal taxa, the majority were saprotrophs and white-rot fungi. Although our approach did not allow us to determine which taxa produced which enzymes, their ecological placement suggests their direct involvement in the decomposition of deadwood [
 <xref rid="B70-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Some other taxa were endophytes, plant pathogens and ectomycorrhizal fungi that have been observed in living wood and here used deadwood as a source of nutrients [

 <xref rid="B66-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The composition of the fungal community at the genus level confirmed high diversity and highlighted the heterogeneity of the community. Indeed, comparisons of individual CWDs from the same decay length for each tree species separately indicated that some genera dominated certain CWDs but were absent from others. Such heterogeneity between CWDs of the same tree species and the same decay length is likely the result of several factors: CWD size heterogeneity [
 <xref rid="B29-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], fine-scale heterogeneity of the surrounding environment [

 <xref rid="B72-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], or the stochastic assembly process of fungal communities on fresh deadwood with a strong priority effect [
 <xref rid="B73-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Although some genera were present at all decay stages, many others were constrained to certain stages of decay, confirming the successional pattern of the deadwood fungal communities [
