<p>Interestingly, most of the enzymes that were expressed followed the same trends over the decay length. In 
 <italic>Fagus</italic>, the set of enzymes simultaneously expressed was higher than that for 
 <italic>Abies</italic>, suggesting more efficient decomposition. This finding is consistent with that of Přívětivý et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], who highlighted a higher decay rate for 
 <italic>F. sylvatica</italic> (mean residence time of 39 years) than for 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> (58 years). The simultaneous expression of many enzymes also suggested that the fungal communities were able to degrade all wood components at the same time.
