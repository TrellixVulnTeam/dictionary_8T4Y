<p>In this study, we characterized the deadwood fungal communities and wood chemistry over more than 40 years of wood decay. As previously observed for deadwood chemistry over the decomposition process [

 <xref rid="B53-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], pH and the C/N ratio decreased over the decay length. The decrease in pH could partly result from the secretion of acidic components by wood-decomposing fungi [

 <xref rid="B56-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] that acidify wood to increase the catalytic efficiency of their extracellular enzymes [
