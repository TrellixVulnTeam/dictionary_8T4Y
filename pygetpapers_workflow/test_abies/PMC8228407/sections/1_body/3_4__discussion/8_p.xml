<p>After identifying the main environmental drivers, i.e., pH and C/N, our aim was to determine how they affected the dominant fungal taxa that played a major role in deadwood decomposition. Interestingly, by looking at the response of individual taxa, we noticed high disparity. The abundance of approximately half of the dominant taxa was significantly affected by pH, C/N or their interaction. Moreover, contrary to our expectation that pH would be the strongest predictor [

 <xref rid="B81-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] and acidification of forests [

 <xref rid="B83-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] are expected; the latter is already observed in the Salajka forest [
 <xref rid="B34-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. From our findings, most of the dominant taxa will be positively affected by an increase in pH but negatively affected by an increase in N. Nevertheless, we demonstrated that many dominant taxa were not affected by pH or C/N, so we can assume that the important decomposition functions will be maintained. How the decay length of trees will be affected remains an open question.
