<p>Although fungal biomass correlated with enzyme activity, no significant clear correlation was found between fungal diversity, assessed through the Chao-1 index, and fungal biomass and activity. Nevertheless, in the young CWD (i.e., in the &lt;7 class), the diversity of the fungal community was low in both tree species, consistent with the lowest biomass and the lowest activity of all enzymes. This may be due to the low N content, which limits many fungal taxa. Some fungi, such as the fungal endophytes of living trees—mutualists, pathogens or neutral taxa—are, however, able to cope with this limitation [

 <xref rid="B66-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Thus, both the fungal community diversity and their decomposition activity are enhanced in older decay stages. Globally, we observed an increase in diversity over the decay length, a pattern previously observed [
