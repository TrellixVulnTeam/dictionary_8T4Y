<p>Although it is interesting to be able to predict the responses of individual taxa to future global change, additional work is necessary to predict the functioning of the whole deadwood fungal community. It was evident that plant pathogenic species were among the fungi with larger ranges of pH tolerance than brown-rot fungi or endophytes, for example, while brown-rot fungal species showed the narrowest range of C/N ratios. Such a broad ecological niche for plant pathogens has recently been demonstrated concerning temperature and precipitation tolerance [

 <italic>Fagus</italic> than in that of 
 <italic>Abies</italic>. Consequently, the differential response of fungal ecogroups to climate change could condition the response of the tree community, i.e., favour certain tree species over others, and thus reduce the species diversity of the plant communities. Such differential responses according to the tree species considered have already been demonstrated in some European forests as a result of global changes, such as temperature, precipitation or air pollution [
