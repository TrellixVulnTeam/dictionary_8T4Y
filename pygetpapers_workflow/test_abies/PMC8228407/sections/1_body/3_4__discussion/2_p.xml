<p>Fungal biomass content showed a negative correlation with the C/N ratio. Although fungi are able to colonize N-poor substrates, including deadwood, due to their low N requirements [

 <xref rid="B63-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], the C/N ratio observed here in the youngest deadwood was very high, and its decrease definitely promoted fungal growth [
