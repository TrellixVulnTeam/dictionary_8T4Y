<p>Lignin showed a significant increase only in 
 <italic>Fagus</italic>, with a slight increase in the CWD in the 7–19 class compared to the CWD in the &lt;7 class. The relative content of lignin usually rises over the decomposition period [

 <xref rid="B68-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. However, lignin is a more recalcitrant compound and is less easily degraded than cellulose and hemicellulose [

 <xref rid="B69-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. By looking at the enzymes involved in lignin degradation, i.e., laccase and Mn-peroxidase [
 <xref rid="B42-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], we observed no significant variation over decay length, except that Mn-peroxidase was more highly expressed in 
 <italic>Fagus</italic> than in 
 <italic>Abies</italic>. This difference between tree species could be linked to the increase in lignin content for 
 <italic>Fagus</italic>. However, it seems that the fungal communities preferentially degraded cellulose and hemicellulose, with a difference between tree species. Indeed, β-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase and esterase were highly secreted in 
 <italic>Fagus</italic> CWD in the 7–19 class, showing that the fungal communities degraded both cellulose and hemicellulose. In 
 <italic>Abies</italic>, however, the pattern of enzymatic secretion revealed fungal communities preferentially degrading less recalcitrant wood compounds, such as xylan and hemicellulose.
