<p>The abovementioned effects of tree species, deadwood chemistry and decay stage on decomposing fungi have usually been addressed at the community level. While some information is available on the successional preferences of certain fungal taxa [

 <xref rid="B25-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], studies addressing the effects of other environmental factors are relatively rare. Moreover, the existing knowledge is largely based on fungal sporocarp surveys [

 <xref rid="B27-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], an approach that has several important limitations: sporocarp production does not occur in all fungal species [

 <xref rid="B28-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and in others, it occurs only transiently at specific stages of the fungal life cycle [

 <xref rid="B30-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Such information is thus biased and not available for non-fruiting fungi.
