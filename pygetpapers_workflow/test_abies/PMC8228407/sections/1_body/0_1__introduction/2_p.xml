<p>Previous studies have shown that the composition of deadwood fungal communities could be affected by several environmental factors, namely, tree species [

 <xref rid="B13-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and deadwood size [
 <xref rid="B14-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], as well as by the decay stage [
 <xref rid="B15-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In certain surveys, tree species were previously indicated as the main drivers of deadwood fungal community composition [

 <xref rid="B16-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], although this observation might not necessarily be valid in all instances [
