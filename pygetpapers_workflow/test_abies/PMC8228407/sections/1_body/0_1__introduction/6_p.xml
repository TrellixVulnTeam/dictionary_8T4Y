<p>The specific objectives were (i) to characterize deadwood fungal communities by identifying their diversity, abundance and functional role over the decay process, (ii) to determine the relative importance of environmental drivers, i.e., decay stage, tree species and wood properties, to the fungal community composition, and (iii) to identify environmental drivers of the presence of dominant fungal taxa. We hypothesized that the composition of the fungal community differs between decay stages [
 <xref rid="B18-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Tree species were expected to be the main driver of fungal community composition [
 <xref rid="B11-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and we expected wood chemistry to influence the fungal community composition in combination with decay stage [
 <xref rid="B31-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The increase in nitrogen (N) content in deadwood during decomposition of 
 <italic>F. sylvatica</italic> and 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> [
 <xref rid="B18-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] might be responsible for the distinction of early and late colonizers [
 <xref rid="B25-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and thus represent the most important chemical factor defining the niche space of individual fungal taxa.
