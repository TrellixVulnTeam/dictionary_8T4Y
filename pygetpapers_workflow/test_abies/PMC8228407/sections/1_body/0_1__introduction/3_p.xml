<p>Fungal communities on decomposing wood change during the process of decomposition [
 <xref rid="B15-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,

 <xref rid="B20-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Among the saprotrophic fungi mainly involved in deadwood decomposition, soft-rot ecological guilds contain pioneer species, while white-rot and brown-rot guilds appear to dominate during advanced decomposition [

 <xref rid="B21-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Notably, the abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi increases during later decay stages due to the increase in the contact surface between deadwood and soil which contains high amount of ectomycorrhizal fungi [

 <xref rid="B23-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The evolution of total fungal biomass during wood decomposition shows various patterns, i.e., both an increase [
 <xref rid="B18-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and a decrease [
 <xref rid="B24-jof-07-00412" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], depending on the substrate.
