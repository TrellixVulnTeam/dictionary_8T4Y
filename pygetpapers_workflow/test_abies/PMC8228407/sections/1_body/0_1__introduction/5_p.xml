<p>This study used several analytical methods of both deadwood fungal communities and deadwood properties with the aim of describing the assembly of fungal communities during the decay process in a mixed natural forest and addressing questions about niche preferences of dominant fungal taxa. The composition of fungal communities in the deadwood of two tree species, 
 <italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic> and 
 <italic>Abies alba</italic>, was studied at four decay stages covering over 40 years of successive development. Fungal diversity was assessed by metabarcoding, with the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) as a molecular marker. Fungal activity was approximated through quantification of extracellular enzymatic activities and assignment of putative ecology to fungal genera.
