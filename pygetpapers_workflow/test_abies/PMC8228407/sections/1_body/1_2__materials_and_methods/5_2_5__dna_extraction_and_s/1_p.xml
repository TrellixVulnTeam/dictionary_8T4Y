<p>For DNA extraction, the two batches of sawdust initially collected for each CWD were kept separated. For each batch, total genomic DNA was extracted twice from 150 to 200 mg of freeze-dried wood powder with the NucleoSpin Soil Kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany). The resulting four DNA extracts per log were pooled before PCR amplification. The ITS2 region of fungal rDNA was amplified in triplicate using the primers gITS7 and ITS4 [

 <sup>−1</sup> in a 25 µL final volume containing 2.5 μL of 10 × buffer for DyNAzyme DNA Polymerase, 1.5 μL of bovine serum albumin at 10 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, 0.5 μL of 10 mM PCR Nucleotide Mix, 0.75 μL of DyNAzyme II DNA Polymerase at 2 U μL
 <sup>−1</sup>, 1 μL of 10 µM of each primer and 16.75 μL of H
 <sub>2</sub>O. The PCR amplification conditions were 94 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by 7 min at 72 °C. The three PCR products were then pooled, purified using a MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and quantified with a Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) on a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). An amplicon library was prepared from the purified PCR products using a TruSeq DNA PCR-free Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), and the resulting library was sequenced in-house on an Illumina MiSeq platform (2 × 250 base paired-end reads). Raw sequencing data have been deposited into the National Center for Biotechnology Information database under the accession number PRJNA693561.
