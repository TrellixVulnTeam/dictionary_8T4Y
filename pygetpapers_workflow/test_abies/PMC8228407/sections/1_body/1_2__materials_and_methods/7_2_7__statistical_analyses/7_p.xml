<p>For detailed analyses of the fungal taxa, the most abundant taxa were defined as those with &gt;0.5% relative abundance in at least three CWDs or with &gt;10% relative abundance in at least one CWD. Among the 208 most abundant taxa, 76 dominant taxa were selected for individual analyses. The 76 dominant taxa were those combining the two criteria chosen for the selection of the most abundant taxa. A species was considered associated with a certain tree species when it was recorded to have a relative abundance &gt;0.1% in at least two CWDs. The effect of pH, C/N and their interaction on the abundance of these 76 taxa was evaluated with linear models.</p>
