<p>The sampling of deadwood was performed on 14–16 October 2014. The selection of dead trees was made before the visit to the site to avoid subjectivity in the sampling. Two tree species, 
 <italic>F. sylvatica</italic> and 
 <italic>A. alba</italic>, and four decay classes were selected. Only trees with a DBH between 30 and 100 cm at the time when the trees were first recorded as fallen were considered. The decay classification was based on the year when the tree was first recorded as fallen. Trees that decayed while standing were excluded because the length of decomposition was unclear. The deadwood decay classes were designated as follows: &lt;7 (recorded as fallen in 2014, &lt;7 years of decomposition), 7–19 (recorded as fallen in 2007, 7–19 years), 20–40 (recorded as fallen in 1994, 20–40 years), and &gt;40 (recorded as fallen in 1974, &gt;40 years of decomposition). A total of 120 dead tree trunks (coarse woody debris, CWD) were randomly selected, ensuring even coverage of both tree species, and all decay classes were sampled (57
