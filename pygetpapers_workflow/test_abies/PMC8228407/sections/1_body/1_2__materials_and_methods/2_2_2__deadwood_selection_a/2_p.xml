<p>For deadwood sampling, the length of each CWD (or the sum of the lengths of its fragments) was measured, and deadwood was collected at four positions (1/5, 2/5, 3/5 and 4/5 of the length) using a 40 cm drill with a 10 mm diameter bit. Before drilling, plants, lichens and surface bark were removed. The drill bit was sterilized with ethanol between drillings. Sawdust was collected in batches of two adjacent drill holes in sterile plastic bags and frozen at −20 °C within a few hours after drilling.</p>
