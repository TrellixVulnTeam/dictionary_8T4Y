<p>The determination of pH was performed with an electronic pH meter model 3510 (Jenway, United Kingdom), according to an in-house protocol, i.e., after mixing wood powder in distilled water (1:10) and incubation for 24 h at room temperature. Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents were measured at the Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences (Průhonice, Czech Republic) as previously described in Větrovský and Baldrian [

C was measured using sulfochromic oxidation (ISO 14235), and N was estimated by sulfuric acid mineralisation with the addition of selenium and sodium sulfate and conversion to ammonium ions (ISO 11261), which were measured by a segmented flow analyser. The Klason lignin content was measured as the dry mass of solids after hydrolysis with 72% (
