<p>Extracellular enzyme activity was differentially affected by decay length for both tree species (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-jof-07-00412">Figure S1</xref>). Out of the twelve enzymes assessed, only eight responded to environmental parameters, and the others, i.e., α-glucosidase, endocellulase, endoxylanase and laccase, were not affected by tree species, decay class or their interaction (0.15 &lt; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.98). β-glucosidase, β-galactosidase and cellobiohydrolase were affected by decay class for 
 <italic>Fagus</italic> only, while β-xylosidase, 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminidase, phosphomonoesterase and esterase were affected by decay length in both tree species (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-jof-07-00412">Figure S1</xref>). In 
 <italic>Fagus</italic>, the lowest enzyme activities were measured for CWD in the &lt;7 class, and the content then increased for CWD in the 7–19 class and tended to stabilize for CWD in the &gt;40 class. In 
 <italic>Abies</italic>, the enzyme content tended to be lowest for CWD in the &lt;7 class and then increased for CWD in the 7–19 class before slightly decreasing for CWD in the 20–40 class; the exception was phosphomonoesterase, for which the content was highest in CWD in the 20–40 class. In 
 <italic>Abies</italic>, the content of enzymes slightly increased in CWD in the &gt;40 class. Manganese peroxidase was affected by tree species, with a higher activity in 
 <italic>Fagus</italic> than in 
 <italic>Abies</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).
