<p>Fungal biomass assessed through ergosterol content in the CWD was significantly affected by decay length in both tree species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-07-00412-f001">Figure 1</xref>D). The youngest CWD had the lowest ergosterol contents (14.1 ± 2.7 µg g
 <sup>−1</sup> in 
 <italic>Abies</italic> and 11.9 ± 2.0 µg g
 <sup>−1</sup> in 
 <italic>Fagus</italic>). In 
 <italic>Abies</italic>, the ergosterol content slowly increased in the older decay classes up to a maximal average of 57.6 ± 13.3 µg g
 <sup>−1</sup> for CWD in the &gt;40 class. In 
 <italic>Fagus</italic>, the ergosterol content strongly increased in CWD in the 7–19 class, stabilizing at approximately 120 µg g
 <sup>−1</sup> (
