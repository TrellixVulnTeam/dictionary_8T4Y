<p>The Chaoâˆ’1 diversity index varied between 268 and 1279; in 
 <italic>Abies</italic>, the fungal diversity in the youngest deadwood was significantly lower than that in the CWD older than 20 years, while in 
 <italic>Fagus</italic>, the fungal diversity in the youngest deadwood was significantly lower than that in the CWD between 7 and 40 years old (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-jof-07-00412">Figure S2</xref>). Saprotrophic and white-rot fungi dominated the deadwood fungal communities, with average abundances of 42 and 41% of all sequences, respectively. Ectomycorrhizal fungi were significantly more abundant in 
 <italic>Abies</italic> deadwood, while the opposite was true for plant pathogens (
