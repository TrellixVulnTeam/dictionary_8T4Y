<p>The deadwood fungal communities were largely dominated by Basidiomycota (69.9%) and Ascomycota (28.3%), followed by Zygomycota (0.6%), Chytridiomycota (0.2%), Rozellomycota (0.1%) and Glomeromycota (&lt;0.1%). Globally, the orders present in the older CWD were the same as those present in the young CWD in the &lt;7 class, but the abundances changed with decay length. The abundance of the dominant order Agaricales increased with time, while that of the second most abundant order, Polyporales, decreased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-07-00412-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Some orders were more abundant for 
 <italic>Abies</italic> than 
 <italic>Fagus</italic>, e.g., Hymenochaetales, Agaricomycetes and Russulales, while some orders were more abundant for 
 <italic>Fagus</italic> than 
 <italic>Abies</italic>, e.g., Xylariales (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-jof-07-00412">Figure S3</xref>). In addition, the dominant fungal genera were both tree- and decay stage-specific. 
 <italic>Ganoderma</italic> was present in both tree species, with a high relative abundance in only the youngest deadwood. Several genera exhibited tree specificity, including 
 <italic>Eutypa</italic> and 
 <italic>Fomes</italic>, which were more abundant in 
 <italic>Fagus</italic> CWD in the &lt;7 and 7â€“19 classes, and 
 <italic>Resinicium</italic>, 
 <italic>Inocybe</italic> and 
 <italic>Hyphodontia</italic>, which were abundant in 
 <italic>Abies</italic> during certain stages of decomposition (
