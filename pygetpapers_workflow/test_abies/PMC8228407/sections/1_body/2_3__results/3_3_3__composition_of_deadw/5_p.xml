<p>Finally, the significance of the environmental drivers fitted on the NMDS of each tree species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-07-00412-f003">Figure 3</xref>B,C) demonstrated that the main drivers of the fungal community composition for both tree species were the decay length, followed by C/N and pH. In 
 <italic>Abies</italic>, the N content, followed by the lignin content, was the significant driver of the fungal community composition, while in 
 <italic>Fagus</italic>, the lignin content, followed by the N content, was the significant driver.
