<p>The results of the variance partitioning showed that decay length, tree species and wood chemistry all had significant effects on fungal community composition. Most of the variation was explained by the joint effect of deadwood chemistry, i.e., pH, N, C, C/N and lignin, and tree species (2.4%), then by the pure effect of chemistry (2.2%) and by the joint effect of deadwood chemistry and decay class (1.9%). Only 1.1% and 0.6% of the variation was explained by the pure effects of tree species and decay class, respectively. A total of 91.7% of the variation remained unexplained by tested variables. Within both tree species individually, most of the variation in the fungal community composition was explained by the pure effect of deadwood chemistry, i.e., 3.7% for 
 <italic>Abies</italic> and 4.8% for 
 <italic>Fagus</italic>.
