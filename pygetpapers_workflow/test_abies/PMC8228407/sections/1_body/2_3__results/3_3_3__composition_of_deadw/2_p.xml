<p>The composition of the fungal communities in the deadwood was significantly affected by decay class (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.03), tree species (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.04) and their interaction (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.02). The fungal community composition tended to be similar for both tree species in the youngest decay class, while the fungal community composition was increasingly tree species-specific with increasing deadwood age (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-07-00412-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). For both tree species, similarities in the composition of the fungal communities decreased with increasing decay length (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 for both tree species).
