<p>The pH values of individual CWDs ranged between 3.5 and 6.5. Regardless of the tree species, pH decreased during deadwood decomposition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-07-00412-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). The C/N ratio was highly variable, ranging from 30 to 439. For both tree species, the highest average C/N ratio was observed in the youngest CWD class: 338 ± 20 in 
 <italic>Abies</italic> and 287 ± 15 in 
 <italic>Fagus</italic>. For the older decay classes, the C/N ratios halved and did not significantly differ from each other (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-07-00412-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). The N contents were lowest in the youngest CWD, with 0.12 ± 0.01 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup> and 0.15 ± 0.01 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup> in 
 <italic>Abies</italic> and 
 <italic>Fagus</italic>, respectively. The lignin content in the 
 <italic>Abies</italic> CWD varied considerably, from 13.3% to 82.2%, and was not significantly affected by decay length (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-07-00412-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). In 
 <italic>Fagus</italic>, lignin content was significantly lower in the youngest CWD (
