<p>The abundance of 33 of the 76 dominant fungal taxa responded significantly to pH, C/N or their interaction (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-jof-07-00412">Table S2</xref>). Twenty-five fungal taxa were affected by pH alone or its interaction with C/N, and 24 were affected by C/N alone or its interaction with pH (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-07-00412-f005">Figure 5</xref>). However, the effects of pH and C/N on taxa abundance strongly differed between taxa (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-07-00412-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Out of 25 fungi responding to pH, the abundances of 15 taxa correlated positively with pH, while the abundances of 10 taxa showed a negative correlation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-07-00412-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). Concerning C/N, an increase in abundance with the C/N ratio was recorded in 14 taxa, and a decrease was recorded in 10 taxa (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-07-00412-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). Plant pathogens and lichenized fungi showed the largest range of pH tolerance, while brown-rot fungi had the lowest range of C/N ratios (
