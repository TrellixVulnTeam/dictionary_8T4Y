H. Karst.) is one of the most important commercial tree species distributed naturally in the Boreal and subalpine forest zone of Europe. All parts of spruce trees, including needles, accumulate essential oils with a variety of chemical properties and ecological functions, such as modulating plant-insect communication. Annual needle samples from 15 trees (five from each of three habitats) of 15-17 years old were assayed for essential oils and their major compounds, including \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene, (1S)-(-)-\u03b1-pinene, and (1R)-(+)-\u03b1-pinene across a growing season. Results showed strong positive correlation between percentages of \u03b1- and \u03b2-pinene isomers (r = 0.69, <i>p</i> < 0.05) and between pinene isomers and essential oils: \u03b1-pinene correlated with essential oil stronger (r = 0.62, <i>p</i> < 0.05) than \u03b2-pinene (r = 0.33, <i>p</i> < 0.05). Correlation analyses performed with some weather conditions, including average monthly temperature, growing sum of effective temperatures over 5 \u00b0C, duration of sunshine, accumulated precipitation, relative humidity, and pressure, showed that temperature is the most important weather condition related to pinene dynamics: negative correlations of moderate strength were established between percentages of \u03b1- and \u03b2- pinenes and average monthly temperatures (r = -0.36, <i>p</i> < 0.01, n = 75 and r = -0.33, <i>p</i> < 0.01, n = 75, respectively).
