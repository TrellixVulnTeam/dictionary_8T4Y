<p>Afterward, 1% solutions of essential oils were prepared with a mixture of diethyl ether and n-pentane (1:1) for further investigations. The analysis of essential oils was carried out using a FOCUS GC (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector (FID). Data were processed with the CHROM-CARD S/W. The silica capillary column TR-5 (30 m, i. d. 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 µm) was used for the analysis of α and β pinenes, myrcene, limonene, camphene, and bornyl acetate with the following GC parameters: carrier gas helium flow rate 1.6 mL/min; temperature program from 40 °C to 250 °C increasing at 4 °C/min; detector temperature 260 °C; split injector was heated at 250 °C. The identification of α and β pinenes, myrcene, limonene, camphene, and bornyl acetate was carried out by the comparison of the retention time (RT) of their GC peaks in the FID chromatograms with the RT of α and β pinenes, myrcene, limonene, camphene, and bornyl acetate analytical standards (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MI, USA) under the same GC parameters and column. The percentage amounts of these compounds were recalculated according to the areas of the FID chromatographic peaks assuming that all constituents of the essential oil comprise 100%.</p>
