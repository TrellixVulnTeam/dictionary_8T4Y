<p>α-Pinene enantiomers were separated on HP
 <sup>–</sup>Chiral–20B column (30 m length, 0.249 mm id, 0.25 µm film thickness) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02138">Figure S1</xref>). The following GC parameters were used for the analysis of enantiomers: carrier gas helium flow rate of 1.6 mL/min; temperature program from 85 to 160 °C increasing at 5 °C/min; detector temperature 260 °C; split injector was heated at 250 °C. The identification of (1R)-(+)-α-pinene and (1S)-(–)-α-pinene was carried out by the comparison of RT of its GC peaks in FID chromatograms with the RT of (1R)-(+)-α-pinene and (1S)-(–)-α-pinene analytical standards (Sigma-Aldrich; purity (GC area %) ≥98.5% and ≥99.0%, respectively) under the same GC parameters and column. The percentage amounts of enantiomers were recalculated according to the areas of the FID chromatographic peaks assuming that the monoterpene α-pinene fraction is 100%.
