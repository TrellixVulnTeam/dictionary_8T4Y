<p>Five individual plants of 15–17 years old were chosen randomly and marked in each habitat; in total, 15 individual plants were studied. Each plant was assigned a number by combining habitat number with plant number within that habitat, i.e., 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1,4, 1.5, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5. Annual shoots were sampled from each 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> tree separately with monthly intervals from May to September, on day 28 or 29 of each month. The period of sampling was chosen considering the duration of the growing season of 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> in Lithuania, where its growth begins in the middle-end of May and lasts 4–5 months [

Shoot samples were then dried at room temperature separately. To establish air-dry mass, shoots were weighed before and after drying. The yield of air-dry mass was then calculated by the following formula: Y = C/D*100%, where Y–air-dry mass yield (%); C–mass of air-dry shoots (g), D–mass of fresh shoots (g).
