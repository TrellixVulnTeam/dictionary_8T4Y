<p>Percentages of essential oils varied with a range of 0.41–0.52% (
 <italic>v/w</italic>) on average during the growing season (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02138">Table S1</xref>). However, no statistically significant differences were observed between months. The lowest average (0.41 ± 0.18% (
 <italic>v/w</italic>)) of essential oil percentage was established at the beginning of the growing season and the highest in July (0.52 ± 0.27% (
 <italic>v/w</italic>)). A decrease in essential oil percentage was observed in the second half of the growing season. However, 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> demonstrated different variation patterns of the quantitative composition of essential oils during the growing season, measured by the coefficient of variation (from CV = 4% in tree 1.1 to CV = 55% in tree 3.3), and percentages of essential oils differed significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) between months in most individuals of 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02138-f002">Figure 2</xref>a–c). For example, the highest percentages of essential oils were established in May, in June, in July, and in August in three, six, four, and two trees, respectively. Individuals No. 2.2 and No. 3.3 distinguished most, showing the highest percentages of essential oils (1.22 ± 0.04% (
 <italic>v/w</italic>) in June and 1.04 ± 0.02% (
 <italic>v/w</italic>) in July, respectively), significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), differing from the percentages in other months (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02138-f002">Figure 2</xref>). While the lowest percentages of essential oils were established mostly at the beginning of the growing season (40% of trees in May), July was the month with the lowest percentage of essential oils in 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> No. 3.4 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02138-f002">Figure 2</xref>c). The amount of essential oils accumulated in this tree in July was significantly lower (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) than in any other four months. One-way ANOVA revealed no significant differences between means of essential oil percentages between habitats across months except between habitats 1 and 3 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.048) in May. However, no significant effect of habitat was detected (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.119). A bit different picture was obtained when pooled monthly data were compared between habitats, i.e., the significant differences were established between habitats 1 and 2 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.045) and 1 and 3 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003). An estimated habitat effect in this case amounted to 11.8% (F = 4.825, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.011).
