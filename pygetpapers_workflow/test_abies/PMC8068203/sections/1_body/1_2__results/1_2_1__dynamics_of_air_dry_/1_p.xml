<p>The dynamics of air-dry mass yield of annual shoots (n = 15 trees) during the growing season is demonstrated in

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02138">Table S1</xref>. The highest mass yield in August was 2.5 times bigger than the lowest one in May. The highest leap of growth was observed in the period from May to June (the mass has nearly doubled), while the lowest (only 2%) occurred in the period from June to July. A very small decrease was observed at the end of the growing season, from August to September. Most of the mean values of the mass yield differed significantly (
