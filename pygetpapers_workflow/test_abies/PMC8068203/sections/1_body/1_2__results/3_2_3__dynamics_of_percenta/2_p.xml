<p>The highest and the lowest percentages of (1S)-(−)-α-pinene in different 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> trees were established in different months, but two-thirds of the studied trees demonstrated their highest amounts of (1S)-(−)-α-pinene in May (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02138-f004">Figure 4</xref>a,b). However, regardless of the negative correlation between both enantiomers, the lowest percentage of (1S)-(−)-α-pinene occurred in July and the highest percentage of (1R)-(+)-α-pinene–in August. Both high standard deviation of (1R)-(+)-α-pinene established in May–September and that of (1S)-(−)-α-pinene observed in August resulted from the absence or undetectable quantities of these enantiomers in the respective months (
