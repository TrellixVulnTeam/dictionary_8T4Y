<p>α-Pinene was determined to be enantiomerically pure (100%) for their (−) form or (−)-α-pinene exceeded (+)-α-pinene by 3 to 12.2 times (i.e., the racemic composition of α-pinene) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02138">Table S3</xref>). The purity of 74.8% for the (1S)-(−) enantiomer in enantiomeric racemates of α-pinene was the lowest. Both enantiomers were interdependent, i.e., an increase in (1S)-(−) enantiomeric form in α-pinene fraction was always accompanied by a decrease in (1R)-(+) enantiomeric form (r = −0.95,

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and r = 0.27, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, respectively).
