<p>The highest amounts of pinenes in annual needles of most investigated trees were found in May; only in three (2.1, 3.2, and 3.3) and two (1.2 and 3.3) individuals, the highest percentages of α-pinene and β-pinene, respectively, were found in other months (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02138-f003">Figure 3</xref>a,b). The first trend—May through June—showed a very strong decrease in percentages of α- and β-pinenes: α-pinene decreased by 1.8 times (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.009) and β-pinene by 2.1 times (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.007). The second trend—June through August—demonstrated a statistically not significant increase in pinene isomers, i.e., by 12% for α-pinene and 18% for β-pinene (
