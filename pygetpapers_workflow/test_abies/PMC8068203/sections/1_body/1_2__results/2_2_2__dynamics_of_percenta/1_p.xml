<p>Variations of α- and β-pinene percentages in essential oils of annual needles of all studied 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> trees are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02138">Table S2</xref>. The results of correlation analysis showed a strong positive correlation between percentages of pinene isomers (r = 0.69, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), implying that the syntheses of α- and β- isomers of pinene are quite closely linked to each other in 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic>. Additionally, statistically significant positive correlations were established between percentages of pinene isomers and essential oils in 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> needles with α-pinene correlating to essential oil stronger (r = 0.62, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) than β-pinene (r = 0.33, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
