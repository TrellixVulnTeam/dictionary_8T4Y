<p>Strong correlation was established between air-dry mass yield and sum of effective temperatures (≥5 °C) (r = 0.86, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, n = 75). No correlations were established between the latter indicator and any those of essential oils, except for weak negative correlations with percentages of α-pinene (r = −0.286, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, n = 75) and β-pinene (r = −0.252, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, n = 75). Additionally, no correlation was established between air-dry mass yield and essential oil percentage during the growing season. Some weak correlations were established between the monthly accumulated precipitation and percentages of α-pinene (r = 0.313, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, n = 75) and β-pinene (r = 0.295, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01, n = 75), of which the former was best pronounced within the habitat No. 1, where α-pinene correlated with precipitation quite strongly (r = 0.525, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, n = 25). No correlations were established between the studied 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> properties and other weather conditions, such as humidity, pressure, and sunshine duration.
