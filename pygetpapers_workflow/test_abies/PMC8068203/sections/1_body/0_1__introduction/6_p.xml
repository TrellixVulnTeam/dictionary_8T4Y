<p>The aim of this study was to establish seasonal dynamics of the quantitative composition of essential oils with the emphasis on α- and β-pinene and enantiomers of α-pinene in annual needles of 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic>. To achieve this aim, we analyzed monthly changes in percentages of essential oils and pinene compounds in the same age (15–17 years old) trees in three very similar habitats, considered as replications. Correlation analyses between essential oil percentages and various weather conditions were employed to reveal this kind of relationship in seasonal dynamics of needle essential oils in 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic>. The variation in the essential oil composition, particularly the contents of pinene isomers, is important to predict their biological effects, for example, to determine the most favorable or unfavorable periods for the associated insect pests.
