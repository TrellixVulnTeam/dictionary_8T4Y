<p>The role of pinenes and some other terpenes are of utmost importance regarding conifer resistance against bark beetles and their associated fungi. In experiments with 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic>, carried out in southern Sweden [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], it was established that terpene composition in stem bark may be related to the Norway spruce resistance against the European spruce bark beetle (
 <italic>Ips typographus</italic>) and bluestain fungus (
 <italic>Ceratocystis polonica</italic>). Moreover, the enantiomeric ratio of (−)-α-pinene was found significantly higher in trees that were attractive to the beetle, compared to unattractive trees [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], suggesting that this enantiomer is important for the life cycle of the beetle. In fact, it was reported earlier that the absence of (−)-α-pinene can slow down or completely prevent the biosynthesis of the bark beetle aggregation pheromone [
