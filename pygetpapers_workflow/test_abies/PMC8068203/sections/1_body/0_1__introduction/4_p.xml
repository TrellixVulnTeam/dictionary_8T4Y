<p>A study on receptor neuron discrimination of α-pinene and limonene enantiomers in the pine weevil (
 <italic>Hylobius abietis</italic>) reported that one olfactory receptor neuron showed a stronger response to the (+)-α-pinene than to (−)-α-pinene, while another neuron responded to limonene enantiomers vice versa. The study concluded that the enantiomeric ratios of volatile compounds may be important in host location by the pine weevil [

 <italic>Hylobius abietis</italic>, however, the effect depended on the (−)-β-pinene/(−)-α-pinene ratio being higher in pine than in spruce [

 <italic>Tomicus piniperda</italic>), which is reported to be the second most destructive shoot-feeding species in Europe [

 <italic>Pinus nigra laricio</italic>, emitting most (−)-α-pinene [
