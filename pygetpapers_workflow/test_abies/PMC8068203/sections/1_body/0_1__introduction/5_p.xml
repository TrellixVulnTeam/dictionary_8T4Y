<p>Some studies demonstrated that major changes in contents of terpenes occur in young leaves, with the developing needles being most strongly affected by age, and therefore, they differ markedly from mature needles in quantitative terpene composition [

 <italic>p. pungens</italic>) [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A significant reduction in β-pinene, limonene, and α-phellandrene contents along with needle age from one to four years old has been reported for 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In general, the terpenes in needles of 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> are controlled by genetic, physiological, and external factors. The most important factors seem to be genetic control, causing great differences between wild trees even at the same narrow location, and needle age, particularly during development [
