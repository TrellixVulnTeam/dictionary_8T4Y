 <italic>Picea abies</italic> accumulates essential oils in all parts of the plant—in leaves (needles), wood, cones, and bark [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, certain peculiarities exist regarding the quantitative and qualitative composition and distribution of essential oils across various parts of the plant. For example, it was reported that in 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> stem wood, higher percentages of α-pinene accumulate in heartwood than in sapwood, while β-pinene takes over in sapwood, compared to heartwood [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. When comparing the yield of oil extractives from wood and bark of 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic>, it was established that bark oil content exceeds that of wood by nearly three times [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A study on cone essential oil composition reported that α-pinene comprised 11%, and β-pinene amounted to 30% of the relative constitution of monoterpene fraction [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Monoterpenes constitute the biggest part of 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> essential oils, amounting to about 70%, with limonene, camphene, and pinene dominating often [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Most of the monoterpenes are good information carriers over long distances because they present low molecular weight lipophilic molecules; in general, a lot of ecologically important interactions between trees and their environment take place via the terpenes [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus, terpenes can perform signaling functions within the population by promoting the protective mechanisms of associated plants or adjacent plant tissues [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Monoterpene pinene is common in conifers and has two structural isomers, i.e., α-pinene and β-pinene with characteristic pine and turpentine smells, respectively [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Their biological functions and properties, although yet under-investigated, comprise quite a wide spectrum. A high therapeutic potential of pinenes with an emphasis on pharmacological activities of α- and β-pinene was revealed in a systematic review by Salehi et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For example, α-pinene has been used as an antibiotic resistance modulator for a multidrug-resistant bacterium 
 <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Additionally, α-pinene is an important terpenoid with anticancer properties, including against N2a neuroblastoma cells [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Synergistic anticancer effects have been demonstrated by α- and β-pinene against non-small cell lung carcinoma with paclitaxel [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The assessment of antimicrobial activity of α- and β-pinene against bacterial (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>) and yeast (
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>) strains showed that (+)-β-pinene had 2–12 times higher activity than (+)-α-pinene against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Percentages of pinene isomers in essential oils vary considerably depending on species of 
 <italic>Picea</italic> (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02138-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>); such a wide interspecific variation is subject largely to genetic differences between species, while the intraspecific variation may be predefined by genetic and environmental factors [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Most terpenes exist in pairs as enantiomers, and pinenes are not an exception—two pairs of enantiomeric forms of pinene isomers coexist naturally in nature: (−)-α-pinene and (+)-α-pinene, (−)-β-pinene and (+)-β-pinene [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It has been reported that needles of 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> accumulate higher amounts of (−)-α-pinene than xylem, while amounts of (−)-β-pinene are similar in both needles and xylem [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Persson et al. established that (+)-α-pinene is the second most prevalent monoterpene after (−)-β-pinene in stem and xylem of five-year-old twigs in 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It has been suggested that differences in the enantiomeric composition of pinene isomers in plant tissues may be the result of alternative biosynthetic pathways operating to different extents in different tissues including needles [
