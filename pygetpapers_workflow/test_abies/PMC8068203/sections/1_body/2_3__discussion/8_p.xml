<p>Our results show that different essential oil chemotypes of 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> could be found under different growing and environmental conditions. Different chemical compositions can considerably affect the biological activity of the essential oil, including the antimicrobial activity, as revealed with thyme (
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> L.) extracts [

 <xref rid="B64-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. It is evident that a better knowledge of seasonal dynamics of pinene isomers and, particularly their chiral compounds, is increasingly important in revealing insect–plant or plant–plant communication in future warmer climate conditions since insects and plants discriminate and respond to changes in chiral compounds [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Our study showed that both intrinsic and environmental factors predefine the dynamics of isomeric and enantiomeric fractions of pinene in essential oils of 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> annual needles during the growing season. Different patterns of essential oil dynamics during the growing season within separate habitats suggested that some genetic variables of 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> might be involved. Therefore, further research is needed to justify factors causing chemotypic variation in 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> better. This could be best achieved by extending the studies on the chemical composition of natural extracts and their biological activities, including natural antioxidants and antimicrobial compounds [
