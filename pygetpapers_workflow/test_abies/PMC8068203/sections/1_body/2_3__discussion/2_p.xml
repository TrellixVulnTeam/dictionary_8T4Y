<p>Essential oil percentages also demonstrated variation during the growing season—the lowest average of essential oil percentage was established in May (0.41%) and the highest in July (0.52%). These data correspond to those obtained in the geographical neighborhood of Lithuania—the percentage of essential oils in needles of 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> growing wild in Latvia varied from 0.36% to 0.53% and was lower in April–May [

 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, the variation of essential oil percentages in individual trees during the growing season showed different patterns. The lowest percentages prevailed in the individual 3.5 (all months except May) and the highest percentages in the individual 2.2 (except for May and July) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02138">Table S1</xref>). Thus, no significant correlation between essential oil percentage and the average monthly temperature was established (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02138-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Although different environmental conditions (climate, light conditions, soil chemistry) and harvesting time of raw material can influence the quantitative composition of essential oils [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], biosynthesis of volatile oils is a genetically controlled process. In our study, all individuals within a habitat grew under the same environmental conditions and thus were similarly influenced regarding their biosynthesis of essential oils. Therefore, some genetic variables of the studied trees might better explain differences in dynamics of essential oil percentages between them during the growing season. Some researchers argue that terpene composition varies less than the absolute amounts, thus allowing to discern 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> genotypes based on the variability of relative amounts of certain terpenes [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Based on relative amounts of limonene and myrcene, they distinguished two genotypic groups, namely, limonene &gt; myrcene (group 1) and myrcene ≥ limonene (group 2). In our study, all 15 spruce trees had limonene dominating over myrcene, from 8 (tree 2.2) to 35.3 (tree 2.5) times on average (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02138">Table S4</xref>). Interestingly, both extreme limonene/myrcene ratios and two next to the extremes (trees 2.4 and 2.3) occurred in trees from the same habitat No. 2. Nevertheless, according to Schönwitz et al. (1989), only one genotype could be distinguished based on the limonene to myrcene ratio [

 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], spruce was defined as a bornyl acetate chemotype when its emission consisted of 35–54% bornyl acetate; 13–29% of limonene, and the content of every other compound was less than 10%. Only one tree (No. 2.1) met these conditions in our study, with 39.42% of bornyl acetate and 15.56% of limonene contents (
