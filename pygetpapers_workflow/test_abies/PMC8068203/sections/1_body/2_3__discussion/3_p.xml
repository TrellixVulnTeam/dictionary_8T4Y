<p>The highest percentages of pinene stereoisomers α- and β- reached 9.32% and 3.11%, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02138">Table S2</xref>). Literature data suggest that percentage of α-pinene can vary from 14.2 to 27.7% in essential oils of needles of this conifer [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Other authors indicate that α-pinene can average to 10.67% of essential oil of 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> needles [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Meanwhile, β-pinene always has been found in amounts several times lower than those of α-pinene [

 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], although both isomers usually occur together in essential oils [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Our study demonstrated that an increase in the percentage of α-pinene was accompanied by an increase of β-pinene in essential oils of annual needles of 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> (r = 0.69, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Similar correlation patterns between these pinene isomers were also observed in cones and leaves of 
 <italic>Juniperus communis</italic> with r = 0.44 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and r = 0.50 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), respectively [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Therefore, it can be presumed that the syntheses of α- and β- isomers of this monoterpene are mutually dependent in 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> and in other conifers.
