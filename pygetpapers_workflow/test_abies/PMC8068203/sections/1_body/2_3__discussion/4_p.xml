<p>The highest amounts of pinenes in annual needles in May were followed by a sharp decrease in June (

 <italic>Picea abies</italic> growing in Latvia during this period (May–September) also were established in May (0.67% and 0.47%, respectively); however, the amounts of both isomers went down gradually, reached the lowest percentages (0.39% and 0.15%, respectively) only in July, and began to rise again just in August [

 <italic>p. sitchensis</italic> and 
 <italic>p. pungens</italic>—percentages of pinenes rose in essential oils of needles in May and then declined during the growing season [
