<p>According to the Lithuanian dendrologists, the growth of new 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> shoots in Lithuania starts in May [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. A widely accepted concept exists that the onset of the growing season of 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> estimated by bud burst depends on the growing degree days above a certain threshold temperature, usually 5 °C [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, one of the latest studies showed that buds of three spruce species (including 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic>) were sensitive to frost probability for early phenological stages, whereas growing degree days controlled the remaining stages [

 <italic>Picea abies</italic>, especially young 15- to 20-year-old trees, suffer from larvae of needle-eating pest 
 <italic>Lygaeonematus abietinus</italic> Christ. (Tenthredinidae) almost every year, usually in May [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The larvae of 
 <italic>L. monacha</italic> are also active in May when the air temperature reaches 10–15 °C [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Thus, the sprouting time of 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> needles coincides with the larvae stage of needle-eating pests 
 <italic>L. abietinus</italic> and 
 <italic>L. monacha</italic>. Most of the terpenes found in essential oils of plants have been demonstrated to possess insecticidal and repellent activities [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Although less research data is available on the effects of pinene as a repellent, compared to many other terpenes, this bicyclic monoterpene has also been shown to repel 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Musca domestica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Therefore, noticeably higher percentages of pinene in essential oils of annual needles at the beginning of the growing season, compared to the further growth period, may relate to plant defense against 
 <italic>L. abietinus</italic> larvae. A study on the effects of 
 <italic>Ceratocystis polonica</italic> on 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> showed significantly higher contents of terpenes in less susceptible and less damaged trees, compared to those more damaged 30 days after the inoculation [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Therefore, the increased amount of diterpenes can be considered a defensive response to the fungal infection. This may also indicate a possible relationship between the monoterpene contents and resistance of 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> to some biotic stress. As reported in one of the reviewed sources, needles of healthier-looking trees contain higher amounts of monoterpenes [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].
