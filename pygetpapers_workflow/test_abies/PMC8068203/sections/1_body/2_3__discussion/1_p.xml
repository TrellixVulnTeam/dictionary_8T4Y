<p>The growing season of 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> in Lithuania starts in May and ends in September–October, depending on autumn weather conditions [

 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our observations showed a continuous growth of annual shoots during the growing period. However, nonmonotonic mass change revealed the pattern of growth rate from May to August, with the fastest growth rate in May through June and a slightly decreasing growth rate from August to September (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02138">Table S1</xref>). Correlation analysis revealed a strong linear relationship between air-dry mass yield and average monthly temperature during the growing season (r = 0.77, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, n = 75) (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02138-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Additionally, even stronger correlation was established between air-dry mass yield and sum of effective temperatures (≥5 °C) (r = 0.86, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, n = 75). Only weak negative correlations established between sum of effective temperatures and percentages of α-pinene (r = −0.286, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, n = 75) and β-pinene (r = −0.252, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, n = 75), suggesting that this derivative meteorological indicator concedes to the use of temperature, a directly measurable factor. The absence of correlation between air-dry mass yield and essential oil percentage during the growing season may have some implications regarding the use of 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> needles as raw material for essential oil production. Regarding habitat effect on essential oil percentages, significant differences were established between habitats 1 and 2 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.045) and 1 and 3 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003), suggesting that more fertile soil in habitat 1 could have discerned it out of the other two sites. However, an estimated habitat effect, in this case, amounted only to 11.8% (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.011), which does not permit us to make any deeper inferences.
