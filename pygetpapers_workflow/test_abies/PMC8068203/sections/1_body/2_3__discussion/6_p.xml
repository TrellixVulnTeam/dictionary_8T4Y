<p>Each of pinene isomers has two enantiomeric forms: α-pinene exists as (1R)-(+)-α-pinene and (1S)-(–)-α-pinene and β-pinene as (1R)-(+)-β-pinene and (1S)-(–)-β-pinene. The enantiomeric composition of α-pinene is variable in time. Regardless of the month, (–)-α-pinene dominated in α-pinene fractions of all investigated essential oils. There was a very strong negative correlation between α-pinene negative and positive enantiomeric forms (r = −0.95, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, it was reported that in needle samples, (–)-α-pinene dominated over its (+) enantiomer [

 <xref rid="B59-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It was also established that the spruce emissions into Boreal forest ambient air were dominated by (−)-enantiomer confirming that this enantiomer is prevalent over (+)-enantiomer in

For example, our previous research showed that different enantiomeric compositions of α-pinene have different effects on microorganisms—α-pinene with the enantiomeric composition of S &lt; R inhibited the growth of bacteria 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>Candida</italic> yeasts more strongly, while α-pinene with enantiomeric composition S ≈ R did so on the growth of

 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic> [
