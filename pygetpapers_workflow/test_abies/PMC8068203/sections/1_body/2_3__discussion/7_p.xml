<p>In our study, the highest percentage of (1S)-(–)-α-pinene was established in May (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02138">Table S3</xref>). It was reported that the enantiomeric composition in 
 <italic>Picea abies</italic> change from more (−)-α-pinene in the younger parts to more (+) enantiomer in the older parts [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In our study, higher percentages of (1S)-(–)-α-pinene in May, in comparison to other months, correspond to the reported observation. Regardless of the negative correlation between both enantiomers of α-pinene, the lowest percentage of (1S)-(–)-α-pinene and the highest percentage of (1R)-(+)-α-pinene were observed in different months. It could be related to the established fact that monoterpene-producing enzymes (i.e., monoterpene synthases) are enantiomer specific [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Effects of environmental factors could not be excluded as well. For example, it has been reported that biosynthesis of (−)-α-pinene is dependent on light levels, which either activate the synthase enzymes and/or provide the necessary energy for biosynthesis [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-26-02138" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. However, in our study, correlation analyses between monthly sunshine duration and amounts of any of pinene enantiomers, isomers, or total essential oils revealed no correlation. This result could be influenced by daily photoperiodism and the angle of sunrise. For example, the longest sunshine duration, 350 h, occurred in August (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02138-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), when days were shorter, compared to June by more than 2 h on average, and sunrise was correspondingly lower than its zenith in June. Some weak correlations were established only between the monthly accumulated precipitation and percentages of α-pinene (r = 0.313, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, n = 75) and β-pinene (r = 0.295, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01, n = 75), of which the former was best pronounced within the habitat No.1, where α-pinene correlated with precipitation quite strongly (r = 0.525, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, n = 25).
