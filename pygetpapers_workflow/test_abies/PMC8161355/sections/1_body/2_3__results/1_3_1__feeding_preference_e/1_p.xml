<p>The prevalence of feeding by the weevils differed (RM ANOVA,

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00473-f002">Figure 2</xref>). During the first two experimental weeks the preferred food source was 
 <italic>P. abies</italic>. From the third week onwards, weevils started to prefer 
 <italic>P. menziesii</italic> and seedlings of this species sustained the most damage. The mean bark area consumed per seedling was 440.8 ± 147.9 mm
 <sup>2</sup>. The second most preferred host was 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> (226.8 ± 72.31 mm
 <sup>2</sup>). For nearly the entire experiment, weevils preferred 
 <italic>L. decidua</italic> over 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic>. However, damages on 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic> dramatically increased during the last week. At the end of experiment mean debarked area reached 181.2 ± 31.77 mm
 <sup>2</sup> on 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic> and 161.2 ± 41.10 mm
 <sup>2</sup> on 
 <italic>L. decidua</italic>. Coniferous species suffering the least damage was 
 <italic>A. alba</italic>. The mean area consumed per seedling was 76.8 ± 62.56 mm
 <sup>2</sup>. 
 <italic>B. pendula</italic> was the least preferred source of food. Damage was registered only at the last week of experiment in one cage and mean damaged area reached 5.2 ± 11.63 mm
