<p>Weevils exhibited large differences in fecundity when fed with different tree species. The largest egg numbers were laid by females fed with 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> and 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic>. Mean size of egg batches reached 26.4 ± 24.89 eggs per female per experiment in the case of 
 <italic>P. abies</italic>. The maximum number of eggs laid by a single female was 90. Similar fecundity was observed in weevils fed with twigs of 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic> (mean 25.10 ± 21.66 eggs per female per experiment, maximum 79 eggs). Females fed with 
 <italic>L. decidua</italic> and 
 <italic>P. menziesii</italic> laid less eggs (RM ANOVA, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0032). Mean size of egg batches per female per experiment was 4.2 ± 4.64 and 3.7 ± 6.55 for these two tree species, respectively. The maximum number of eggs was 13 in females fed with 
 <italic>L. decidua</italic> and 21 in females fed with 
 <italic>P. menziesii</italic> (
