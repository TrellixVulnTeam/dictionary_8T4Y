<p>In this experiment we tested four species of conifers—
 <italic>P. abies</italic>, 
 <italic>L. decidua</italic>, 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic> and 
 <italic>P. menziesii</italic>. One male and one female 
 <italic>H. abietis</italic> were released in a ventilated clear plastic box. Each box contained a twig of one conifer species (length 100 mm, diameter ca. 15 mm) with thin bark serving as a feeding substrate. Prior to the beginning of the experiment beetles were starved for 48 h. A Petri dish with moistened black sand was placed in each box to keep the humidity high and as a substrate for oviposition. In total 40 boxes were prepared, 10 for each tree species. The sex of 
 <italic>H. abietis</italic> was determined according to shape and setae on the last abdominal sternite [
