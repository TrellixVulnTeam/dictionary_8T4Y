<p>We tested six species of trees—
 <italic>P. abies</italic>, 
 <italic>Larix decidua</italic>, 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudotsuga menziesii</italic>, 
 <italic>Abies alba</italic> and 
 <italic>Betula pendula</italic>. The plants used in experiments were one year old seedlings obtained from a commercial nursery (Forests of the Czech Republic, state enterprises, Budkov, Czech Republic). Mean height of seedlings ranged from 25 to 30 cm and stem diameter above the soil was ca. 0.5 cm. Seedlings were planted in groups of six in big plastic boxes (30 × 80 × 50 cm
 <sup>3</sup>; height × length × width). Groups consisted of one seedling of every tree species mentioned above and in total 5 boxes were made and placed in the shaded place in the garden of the Biology Centre in České Budějovice. Wooden frame covered with polypropylene net was then screwed to each of the boxes and ten weevils were released inside in the summer of 2020. Every week, seedlings were inspected and feeding scars on stems measured with transparent millimeter paper. At the end of the experiment, folded trap bark was placed in each box to collect weevils, and soil was inspected for dead beetles. The experiment lasted 6 weeks.
