<p>The large pine weevil 
 <italic>Hylobius abietis</italic> (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is an economically important species causing damage in coniferous plantations in Europe and Asia [

 <xref rid="B2-insects-12-00473" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Its pest status is a consequence of modern silvicultural practices that are largely based on clearcuttings and reforestation. Sanitation logging in the areas of recent bark beetle outbreaks in Europe has magnified the amount of available breeding substrate [
