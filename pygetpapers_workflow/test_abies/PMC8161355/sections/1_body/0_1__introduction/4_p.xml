<p>The objective of this study was to assess the feeding behavior and oviposition rate of 
 <italic>H. abietis</italic> on different plant species. Within this study two experiments were undertaken. The first assessed the adult feeding preferences of 
 <italic>H. abietis</italic> in outdoor conditions when presented with seedlings of five conifer and one broad-leaved species. The second experiment reported here was a laboratory study of the influence of food on fecundity of adults feeding on four species of conifers. The conifers were chosen to reflect the most typical species planted in Central European forestry. Some of these species were tested by previous authors, but for most of them, no studies of 
 <italic>H. abietis</italic> feeding behavior exist. 
 <italic>Betula pendula</italic> was chosen as a supplementary deciduous tree to verify some controversial results regarding the lethal effect of 
 <italic>B. pendula</italic> to pine weevil [

 <xref rid="B31-insects-12-00473" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Knowledge on these topics is of high importance for reforestation activities in the areas of recent bark beetle outbreak, where former spruce monocultures are being converted to mixed-species stands. Mixed-species plantations could also represent an alternative to insecticidal protection of coniferous seedlings.
