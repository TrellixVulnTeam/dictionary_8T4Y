<p>Adult pine weevils fly over long distances in the spring to clear-felled areas to find dying stumps and roots of conifers suitable for breeding [

 <xref rid="B11-insects-12-00473" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. When such habitat is found, adults feed on twigs and branches within the crown of fully grown trees in the surroundings. After two or three weeks, weevils lose their ability to fly, and feed on the bark of newly planted or naturally regenerated coniferous seedlings for the rest of the season [

 <xref rid="B15-insects-12-00473" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Feeding typically occurs near the root collar and on the main stem, and damaged seedlings suffer reduced growth or die when the stem is girdled [

Large pine weevil life cycle depends on local conditions and in the absence of obligatory diapause; temperature is the key factor influencing development, voltinism and abundance. In addition, breeding habitats in roots and stumps eliminate the disadvantage of seasonal food availability and to some extent buffer temperature fluctuations, which may lead to continuous development under suitable conditions [

Shortening of development due to warming climate has recently been recorded in central Europe and emergence of a young generation may occur as early as autumn. Consequently, damage in autumn increases after maturation feeding of young beetles [
