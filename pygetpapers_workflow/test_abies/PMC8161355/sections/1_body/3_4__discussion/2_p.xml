<p>Food source had a significant effect on the number of eggs laid. The highest fecundity was found in females that consumed twigs of 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> and 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic>. Mean egg batches on 
 <italic>P. menziesii</italic> and 
 <italic>L. decidua</italic> reached approximately only a fifth of the two above mentioned species. Although 
 <italic>P. menziesii</italic> was the most damaged host in the feeding preference experiment, oviposition rate indicates its lower nutritional quality, which is consistent with the study [
 <xref rid="B23-insects-12-00473" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. That study reported highest fecundity on 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> followed by 
 <italic>Pinus nigra</italic> and 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic>. The size of egg batches on 
 <italic>P. menziesii</italic> was less than half of those on 
 <italic>P. abies</italic>. 
 <italic>P. sitchensis</italic> was the least suitable host with almost Â¼ of eggs laid. Daily egg production averages in the present study correspond to the [

 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic>. Authors of that study [
 <xref rid="B35-insects-12-00473" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] estimated the average female in the first year of her life lays 70 eggs per growth season. This is in accordance with results of the present study. The effect of food source on reproductive behavior can be altered by the female age and the time period that given host species was consumed [
