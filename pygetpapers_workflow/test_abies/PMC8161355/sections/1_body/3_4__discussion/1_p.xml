<p>Feeding preference experiment results showed conifer tree species are the preferred food source. The largest bark consumption was recorded on 
 <italic>P. menziesii</italic>. These results are in accordance with [
 <xref rid="B33-insects-12-00473" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-insects-12-00473" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] where in both field and laboratory experiments 
 <italic>P. menziesii</italic> and 
 <italic>Picea sitchensis</italic> were the most damaged species. Additionally, relatively high preference for 
 <italic>P. abies</italic>, 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic> and 
 <italic>L. decidua</italic> is in agreement with [
 <xref rid="B33-insects-12-00473" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Similar to our experiment, the only deciduous tree Hybrid aspen (
 <italic>Populus</italic> Ã— 
 <italic>wettsteinii</italic>) was the least preferred source of food [
 <xref rid="B33-insects-12-00473" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. On the other hand, 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic> seems to be the preferred choice in most previously published feeding behavior studies. 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic> twigs were preferred over those of 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> in both choice and no choice experiments and weevils consumed twice as much pine bark regardless of temperature regime [

 <xref rid="B31-insects-12-00473" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Results of the present study are contradictory and area of feeding scars on 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> was double than that of 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic>, which is consistent with [
 <xref rid="B33-insects-12-00473" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. 
 <italic>P. menziesii</italic> has not been tested in choice experiments by any of the previous authors [
 <xref rid="B29-insects-12-00473" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-insects-12-00473" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and seedlings of 
 <italic>Larix sp.</italic> are considered less attractive than 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> and 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic> [
 <xref rid="B33-insects-12-00473" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-insects-12-00473" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Feeding on twigs of 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic>, 
 <italic>P. abies</italic>, 
 <italic>B. pendula</italic>, 
 <italic>Acer pseudoplatanus</italic> and 
 <italic>F. excelsior</italic> was tested in no choice experiment [
 <xref rid="B31-insects-12-00473" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The most preferred source was 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic>, but significant damage was recorded also on 
 <italic>B. pendula</italic>, which was preferred over 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> [
 <xref rid="B31-insects-12-00473" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although 
 <italic>B. pendula</italic> was the second most eaten species, around 70% of weevils did not feed on it. However, high mortality occurred in beetles that consumed 
 <italic>B. pendula</italic> [
 <xref rid="B31-insects-12-00473" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], which is consistent with the results of the present study. The largest debarked area on 
 <italic>B. pendula</italic> was recorded in the box number 5, where mortality exceeded 50%. In contrast, less than 10% of weevils died in other four boxes, where 
 <italic>B. pendula</italic> was not eaten. Previous authors discussed possible effects of thinner bark, lack of nutrients and content of phenolic glycoside compounds as possible explanations for mortality or lower weight gain of weevils feeding on 
 <italic>B. pendula</italic> [
 <xref rid="B27-insects-12-00473" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-insects-12-00473" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> was the least preferred conifer host. Although the total area of damaged bark was less than 1/6 of those recorded on 
 <italic>P. menziesii</italic>, weevils fed on 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> throughout the whole experiment.
