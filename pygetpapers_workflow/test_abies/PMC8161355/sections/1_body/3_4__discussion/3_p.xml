<p>The results of current study may have significant implications for reforestation activities in the areas of recent bark beetle outbreak. Among all tested conifer seedlings 
 <italic>P. menziesii</italic> was the most damaged one. Its vulnerability to 
 <italic>H. abietis</italic> feeding should not be neglected since some studies suggest increasing its proportion in newly planted mixtures up to 40% [
 <xref rid="B40-insects-12-00473" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Therefore, some kind of seedling protection against 
 <italic>H. abietis</italic> should be applied similarly both to 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> and 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic>. The results also indicate that some proportion of weevils fed on 
 <italic>B. pendula</italic> even in the presence of coniferous seedlings, which increased their mortality. Planting 
 <italic>B. pendula</italic> together with conifers may therefore reduce the damage by 
 <italic>H. abietis</italic>, and thus the need of insecticidal treatment. Knowledge of food preferences together with fecundity on alternative food sources may contribute to planning appropriate protective measures and forecasting the damages in areas, where former spruce monocultures are being converted to mixed-species stands.
