<p>Using the frequency of onset as the primary outcome measurement, NQuery Advisor software (version 4.0, Statistical Solutions, Ireland) was used to calculate the appropriate sample size. Based on literature research, the sample size was estimated according to the calculation formula of non-inferiority test. α = 0.025, β = 0.2, non-inferiority margin δ = 15%, ε is the actual difference among groups. One-way test was performed, and the sample size was calculated to show that 103 samples are needed in this study. One hundred eighteen cases were needed in the 3 groups, assuming a 10% non-adherence to treatment and a 5% loss to follow-up. In this study, a total of 120 cases were selected from 3 groups, 40 cases in each group.</p>
