<p>The primary outcome measure will be the definition and classification of nausea and vomiting (NCI-CTC AE4.0) and the MASCC (Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer) Antiemesis Tool (MAT) score, 24 hours and fourth day after chemotherapy, for a third consecutive cisplatin-based chemotherapy cycle. These 2 scales are used to describe the condition and degree of CINV in cancers, and strongly recommended by different international guidelines and widely applied. They are easy-to-use and evaluate the likelihood of a patient's condition. The definition and classification of nausea and vomiting stages the nausea and vomiting into 3 and 4 grades, respectively; and MAT is comprised of 2 sections: 24 hours later and 4 days later. In terms of MAT, each section has 4 identical items including occurrence of nausea and vomiting, frequency of vomiting, and level of nausea.</p>
