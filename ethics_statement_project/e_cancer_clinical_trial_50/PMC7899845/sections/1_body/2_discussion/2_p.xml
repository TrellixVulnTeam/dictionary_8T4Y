<p>Acupoint therapies, including EA and AA, have the characteristics of higher acceptability, limit side effects, and inexpensiveness.

 </sup> do not give us any firm grasp of reasoned acupuncture regimen for preventing CINV. The shortage of the studies which compare different acupuncture therapies cause that clinicians are unable to determine the therapeutic values of them, which is unavailable for selecting the most appropriate treatment.

 </sup> Rather, this is not the whole story. To our best knowledge, there is no single regimen could completely blocking CINV.

 </sup> Therefore, relative studies should focus on all categories of CINV. Unfortunately, most previous researches paid more attention on acute CINV, while delayed CINV is a more common, severe and hard-to-cure subtype.

 </sup> To meet the clinic needs, we design this trail to compare the effectiveness and safety of EA and AA for CINV induced by cisplatin-based regimens in a strictly devised situation, and develop a standardized alternative therapy for medical staff.
