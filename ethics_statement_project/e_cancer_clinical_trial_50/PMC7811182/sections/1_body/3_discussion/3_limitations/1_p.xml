<p>Our study has a few limitations. Our findings must be interpreted in the context of the trial design. As a pilot study, analyses are limited by the small cohort size that established feasibility. Moreover, our methodology was entirely dependent on advanced breast MRI imaging approaches; extrapolation of our results to other imaging modalities must be made with caution.</p>
