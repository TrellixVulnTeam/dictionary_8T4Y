<p>These preliminary results suggest that MRI-guided biopsy was an accurate approach for evaluating the extent of residual disease after NAC. Of the 2 patients with a false-negative MRI-guided biopsy result for definition 2 pCR, 1 had a focus of ductal carcinoma in situ and the other had a microscopic focus of residual invasive cancer. Hence, these findings suggest that a negative MRI-guided biopsy result was a reliable indicator of pCR, or of limited residual disease, after NAC. Surgery has historically been the mainstay for breast tissue diagnosis. Beginning in 1995, we reported that image-guided breast interventions can mimic the accuracy of diagnostic surgical procedures.

 </sup> and has now become a standard-of-care approach. Building on these developments, we hypothesized that MRI-guided biopsy might represent an accurate image-guided approach to diagnosing a pCR, potentially obviating the need for surgical resection among patients with no evidence of residual tumor. This image-based approach could potentially represent a minimally invasive alternative to a surgical procedure of unclear benefit.
