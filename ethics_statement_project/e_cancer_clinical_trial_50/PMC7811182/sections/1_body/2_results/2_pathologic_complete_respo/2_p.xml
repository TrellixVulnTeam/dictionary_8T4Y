<p>Logistic regression showed that age was not significantly associated with surgical pathology findings using pCR definition 1 (log odds ratio (OR), −0.01; 95% CI, −0.14 to 0.12; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .90) or pCR definition 2 (log OR, −0.01; 95% CI, −0.13 to 0.12; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .92). Breast cancer subtype was also not significantly associated with surgical pathology findings using pCR definition 1 (for hormone receptor (HR)–positive, 
 <italic>ERBB2</italic>-negative cancer: log OR, 0.29; 95% CI, −3.91 to 4.49; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .89; for HR-negative,

 <italic>P</italic> = .95; for triple-negative cancer: log OR, 0.86; 95% CI, −2.35 to 4.07;

 <italic>P</italic> = .03) and pCR definition 2 (log OR, 3.51; 95% CI, −0.03 to 7.06;

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI201035-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>). Last, correlation analysis using the Kendall rank correlation coefficient showed a positive association between MRI-guided biopsy results and surgical resection pathology findings for both definitions of pCR (τ = 0.80;
