<p>Of the 23 patients who were enrolled from September 26, 2017, to July 29, 2019, into the trial, 20 (87%) had evaluable data (median [interquartile range] age, 51.5 [39.0-57.5] years; 20 women [100%]; 13 White patients [65%]). Of the 20 patients, the pre-NAC median tumor size on MRI was 3.0 cm (interquartile range, 2.0-5.0 cm); 19 patients (95%) had invasive ductal carcinoma, 15 (75%) had stage II cancer, 11 (55%) had 
 <italic>ERBB2</italic>-positive cancer, and 6 (30%) had triple-negative cancer. Surgical pathology findings demonstrated a pCR in 13 of 20 patients (65%) and no pCR in 7 (35%) when pCR definition 1 was used. The median follow-up for patients with evaluable data was 1.26 years (interquartile range, 0.85-1.59 years). Patient characteristics are included in
