<p>The National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines currently recommend breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and after NAC as the most accurate imaging modality for monitoring treatment response and identifying pCR after NAC, with a reported accuracy of 83%.

 </sup> Although more accurate than mammography, ultrasonography, and clinical breast examination, MRI is not yet sufficient to obviate the need for pathologic confirmation of pCR. Thus, surgical resection is required even for the subset of patients in whom no viable tumor is ultimately detected in the surgical specimen.
