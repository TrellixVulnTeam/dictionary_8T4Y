<p>Whereas the traditional approach to identifying a pCR has required definitive breast surgery after NAC (eg, lumpectomy or mastectomy), there are limited options for the noninvasive determination of residual in-breast disease. Although several clinical trials have reported the potential utility of image-guided biopsies as an alternative to surgery to diagnose pCR after NAC,

 </sup> demonstrated a negative predictive value (NPV) of biopsy to diagnose pCR of 76.7% or less, which is not sufficient to obviate surgery. Notably, these trials did not investigate the utility of MRI or MRI-guided biopsy. In this pilot study, we sought to evaluate the accuracy of MRI-guided biopsy for diagnosing a post-NAC pCR compared with reference-standard breast surgery.
