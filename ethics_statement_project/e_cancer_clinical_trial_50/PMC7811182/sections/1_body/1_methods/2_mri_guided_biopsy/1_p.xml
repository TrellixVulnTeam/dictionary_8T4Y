<p>All MRI-guided biopsies were performed with a 1.5- or 3.0-T whole-body MRI unit (GE Discovery 450w or 750; GE Medical Systems) equipped with a dedicated 8- or 16-channel surface Sentinelle breast coil (Sentinelle Vanguard). Standard-of-care MRI-guided biopsy was performed as previously described

 </sup> except that no intravenous gadolinium was used for this study. Biopsy target was the treated tumor bed defined by the accurately positioned pre-NAC marker at the site of biopsy-proven cancer, anatomic landmarks, or both. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi201035f3">Figure 3</xref> is a representative case showing an imaging complete response after NAC. A 9-gauge vacuum-assisted, MRI-compatible biopsy system (ATEC Breast Biopsy System; Suros Surgical Systems) was used. Through a single incision site, 7 to 12 samples were taken and sent to pathology for analysis. A postbiopsy titanium marker was placed under MRI guidance, and postbiopsy mammography was performed to document representative sampling of the treated tumor bed and adequate positioning of the biopsy marker. The study intervention was defined by the predetermined, nonstudy surgical date. MRI-guided biopsy was performed 0 to 60 days after completing NAC and before surgery.
