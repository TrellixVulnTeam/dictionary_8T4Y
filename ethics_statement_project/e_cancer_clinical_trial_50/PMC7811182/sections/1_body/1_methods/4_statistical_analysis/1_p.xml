<p>For this study, we considered an acceptable NPV to be 85%. With a 1-sided type I error rate of .05 and a statistical power of 95%, a sample of 20 patients was required to detect an acceptable NPV of 85%. Sample size calculation was done using the clinfun package in R, version 3.5.2 (R Foundation) with the ph2single function. We anticipated that 14 of 20 patients (70%) would have a negative (pCR) MRI-guided biopsy result. We estimated NPV, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and accuracy using PROC SURVEYFREQ in SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). As an exploratory analysis, we performed a logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis using the PROC LOGISITIC statement in SAS, version 9.4, with Firth correction. The Firth correction is used to adjust for quasi-complete separation of data points—a statistical phenomenon that occurs when certain values of risk factors or combination of risk factors are almost only associated with a single outcome category, thereby allowing for easy separability of these factors by the outcome variable.

 </sup> Logistic regression analysis was performed using surgical pathology findings as the outcome variable and MRI-guided biopsy pathology results, age, and breast cancer subtype as explanatory variables of interest. A lower limit for the 95% CI of the area of the ROC curve of greater than 0.5 was used to suggest that the MRI-guided biopsy is diagnostically accurate. We chose a lower threshold for the lower bound of the 95% CI for the area under the ROC curve, anticipating a wider CI, which can be mainly attributed to the small sample size. Kendall ranked correlation coefficient was calculated to test for the correlation between MRI-guided biopsy result and reference-standard surgical resection findings. The level of statistical significance was set at an α of .05.
