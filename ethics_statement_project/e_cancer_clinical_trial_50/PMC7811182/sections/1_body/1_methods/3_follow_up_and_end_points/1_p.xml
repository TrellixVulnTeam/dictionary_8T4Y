<p>Results of the MRI-guided biopsy and reference-standard surgical pathological examination were interpreted by breast pathologists, and the Miller-Payne grading system was used to assess tumor response including pCR. Our primary end point was the NPV of MRI-guided biopsy, with a true-negative finding defined as a negative biopsy result (no residual cancer) that corresponded to a surgical pCR. Accuracy, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and specificity were also calculated. Two clinical definitions of pCR were independently evaluated: definition 1 was no residual invasive cancer and definition 2 was no residual invasive or in situ cancer. Other covariates included patient age and breast cancer subtype defined by immunohistochemical surrogates (ie, estrogen hormone receptor, progesterone hormone receptor, and 
 <italic>ERBB2</italic> positive or negative). Accuracy was defined as the ratio of the total number of correct test results (both true-positive and true-negative) to the sample size. Protocol-specified adverse events were defined, and no protocol-specified adverse events were reported.
