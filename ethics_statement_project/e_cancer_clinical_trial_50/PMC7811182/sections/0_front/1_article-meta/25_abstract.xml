  <title>Question</title>
  <p>Is the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)â€“guided biopsy comparable with reference-standard surgical resection for diagnosing pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer?</p>

  <title>Findings</title>
  <p>In this pilot nonrandomized controlled trial of 20 patients with evaluable data, the accuracy of MRI-guided biopsy for diagnosing pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 95% and the negative predictive value was 92.8%.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec id="ab-zoi201035-3">
  <title>Meaning</title>
  <p>The results from this pilot study suggest greater accuracy with this method than do the majority of published data and support the need for a larger study comparing MRI-guided biopsy with reference-standard surgical resection in diagnosing a pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.</p>
