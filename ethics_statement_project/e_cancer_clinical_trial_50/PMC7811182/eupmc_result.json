"<h4>Importance</h4>After neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), pathologic complete response (pCR) is an optimal outcome and a surrogate end point for improved disease-free and overall survival. To date, surgical resection remains the only reliable method for diagnosing pCR.<h4>Objective</h4>To evaluate the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided biopsy for diagnosing a pCR after NAC compared with reference-standard surgical resection.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>Single-arm, phase 1, nonrandomized controlled trial in a single tertiary care cancer center from September 26, 2017, to July 29, 2019. The median follow-up was 1.26 years (interquartile range, 0.85-1.59 years). Data analysis was performed in November 2019. Eligible patients had (1) stage IA to IIIC biopsy-proven operable invasive breast cancer; (2) standard-of-care NAC; (3) MRI before and after NAC, with imaging complete response defined as no residual enhancement on post-NAC MRI; and (4) definitive surgery. Patients were excluded if they were younger than 18 years, had a medical reason precluding study participation, or had a prior history of breast cancer.<h4>Interventions</h4>Post-NAC MRI-guided biopsy without the use of intravenous contrast of the tumor bed before definitive surgery.<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>The primary end point was the negative predictive value of MRI-guided biopsy, with true-negative defined as negative results of the biopsy (ie, no residual cancer) corresponding to a surgical pCR. Accuracy, sensitivity, positive predictive value, and specificity were also calculated. Two clinical definitions of pCR were independently evaluated: definition 1\u2009was no residual invasive cancer; definition 2, no residual invasive or in situ cancer.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty of 23 patients (87%) had evaluable data (median [interquartile range] age, 51.5 [39.0-57.5] years; 20 women [100%]; 13 White patients [65%]). Of the 20 patients, pre-NAC median tumor size on MRI was 3.0 cm (interquartile range, 2.0-5.0 cm). Nineteen of 20 patients (95%) had invasive ductal carcinoma; 15 of 20 (75%) had stage II cancer; 11 of 20 (55%) had ERBB2 (formerly HER2 or HER2/neu)-positive cancer; and 6 of 20 (30%) had triple-negative cancer. Surgical pathology demonstrated a pCR in 13 of 20 (65%) patients and no pCR in 7 of 20 patients (35%) when pCR definition 1 was used. Results of MRI-guided biopsy had a negative predictive value of 92.8% (95% CI, 66.2%-99.8%), with accuracy of 95% (95% CI, 75.1%-99.9%), sensitivity of 85.8% (95% CI, 42.0%-99.6%), positive predictive value of 100%, and specificity of 100% for pCR definition 1. Only 1 patient had a false-negative MRI-guided biopsy result (surgical pathology showed <0.02 cm of residual invasive cancer).<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>This study's results suggest that the accuracy of MRI-guided biopsy to diagnose a post-NAC pCR approaches that of reference-standard surgical resection. MRI-guided biopsy may be a viable alternative to surgical resection for this population after NAC, which supports the need for further investigation.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03289195.", "affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Controlled Clinical Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "research-article", "Clinical Trial, Phase I", "Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": {"grantId": "P30 CA008748", "agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "acronym": "CA", "orderIn": "0"}}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Breast Neoplasms", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "DT", "qualifierName": "drug therapy", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}, {"abbreviation": "PA", "qualifierName": "pathology", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}, {"abbreviation": "SU", "qualifierName": "surgery", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Neoadjuvant Therapy"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Predictive Value of Tests"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Adult"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Female"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Image-Guided Biopsy", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "MT", "qualifierName": "methods", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}}}]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.34045"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7811182"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "N", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "Y", "tmAccessionTypeList": {"accessionType": "nct"}, "dateOfCompletion": "2021-03-16", "dateOfCreation": "2021-01-15", "firstIndexDate": "2021-01-16", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2021-01-23", "dateOfRevision": "2021-03-16", "electronicPublicationDate": "2021-01-04", "firstPublicationDate": "2021-01-04"}, "htmllinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7811182", "abstract": "<h4>Importance</h4>After neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), pathologic complete response (pCR) is an optimal outcome and a surrogate end point for improved disease-free and overall survival.
