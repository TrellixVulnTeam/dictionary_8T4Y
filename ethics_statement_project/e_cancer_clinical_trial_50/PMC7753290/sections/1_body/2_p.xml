<p>We report the challenges and adaptations made to the CARDAMON trial during the peak of the COVID‐19 outbreak in the UK in March–June 2020. CARDAMON is a phase II, randomised, open label clinical trial in transplant‐eligible newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) that assesses the benefit of upfront SCT (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02315716). Patients are treated with intravenous carfilzomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (KCd) as induction, then randomised to standard consolidation with SCT or to a further four cycles of KCd, following which all receive 18 months of maintenance with weekly single agent carfilzomib (d1, 8 and 15).
