<p>This global crisis should encourage the rethinking of study designs to make future clinical trials more flexible and pragmatic. Prompt and practical action successfully mitigated the unavoidable disruption of CARDAMON, protecting patient safety while maintaining trial conduct and optimising scientific integrity. Successful adaptations worth retaining beyond the pandemic include flexibility around remote clinic visits and investigation timing to help improve protocol adherence and trial dropout rates. The postpandemic environment comes with risks of missing or delayed data collection in ongoing trials, possibly impacting data analysis and interpretation. More patient‚Äêcentric study designs that maximise translatability to routine practice may improve research efficiency and outcomes while enhancing patient safety and experience.
