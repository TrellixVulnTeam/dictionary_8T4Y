 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We chose this instrument as it is one of the rare instruments that measure interprofessional team collaboration in qualified healthcare professionals. The Danish version is from 2011 and consists of three subscales; 1) Partnership/shared decision making (19 items), 2) Collaboration (11 items), 3) Coordination (7 items) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The items are distributed on a 5-point Likert scale, 5 = always, 4 = most of the time, 3 = occasionally, 2 = rarely, 1 = never). The difference will be measured on the overall scale.
