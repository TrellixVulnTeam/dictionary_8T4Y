<p id="Par33">CRM involvement is a recognized prognostic factor for local recurrence. Patients who undergo APER have shown to have a higher incidence of CRM involvement [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and has, unfortunately, not diminished with TME. The distance from the anal verge is related to the completeness of TME, because of the greater challenge of performing a perfect resection with adequate margins low down in the pelvis. TME surgery cannot always be carried out down to the levator muscles plane in APER because of the presence of a large tumor. CRM involvement in the APER specimens is often related to the removal of less tissue at the level of the tumor because of a different resection plane. However, the lower cancers elected for APER may be associated with a different pattern of lymphatic spread, which is not included in the tumor package harvested with TME [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].
