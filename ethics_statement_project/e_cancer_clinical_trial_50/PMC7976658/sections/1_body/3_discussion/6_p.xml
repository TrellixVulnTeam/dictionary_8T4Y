<p id="Par34">We believe that in selected low rectal cancer patients, APER is a better option than LAR. In current literature, despite rigorous methodology, the intrinsic limitation/bias of the studies should be considered, and conclusions interpreted with caution. The APER tumors are usually closer to the anal verge and more bulky. Although the patients in the LAR and APER groups are comparable in terms of age, tumor stage, and neoadjuvant treatment and the distribution of tumor stage, however, it would not be possible to eliminate this bias as bigger tumors would tend to undergo a Miles procedure, as sphincter saving would not be attempted. The extent of tumor spread in itself is therefore unlikely to account for the increased surgical margin involvement, consequent local recurrence and lower survival in the APR group.</p>
