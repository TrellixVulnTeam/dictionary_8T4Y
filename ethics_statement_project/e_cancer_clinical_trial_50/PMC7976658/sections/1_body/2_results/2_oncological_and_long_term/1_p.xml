<p id="Par23">Median tumor size was similar in both groups, p = 0.253. The absolute R1 rate (microscopic tumor infiltration of the margin) was higher in the APER group, albeit not reaching statistical significance, p = 0.085. The LAR group had a significantly higher number of harvested lymph nodes (LN) compared to the APER group, p &lt; 0.001. However, there was no difference in lymph node positivity between the two groups, see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The median survival was 55 months in the APER group versus 49 months for the LAR group, although non-significant, p = 0.514 (Fig.
