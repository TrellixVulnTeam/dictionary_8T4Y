<p id="Par24">The overall recurrence rate (local and distant) was 17.6% in the LAR group compared to 23.9% for APER, p = 0.257. There was no difference either in the local recurrence or in the distant recurrence rate between the 2 groups (p = 1.000 and 0.215 respectively). There was also no significant difference in disease-free survival between the two groups (p = 0.455, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). R1 resection was found to have a negative impact on survival and recurrence disease (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Furthermore, T stage and N stage was found to have a negative impact on patient survival (Figs.
