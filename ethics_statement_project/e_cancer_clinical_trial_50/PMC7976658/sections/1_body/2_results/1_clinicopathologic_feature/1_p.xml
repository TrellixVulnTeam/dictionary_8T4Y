<p id="Par21">A total of 270 patients were identified to have surgical treatment for low rectal cancer during the study period. Eight patients were excluded from further analysis due to incomplete data and lack of follow up. Thus, data from 262 patients who underwent a curative surgical TME resection for low rectal cancer were reviewed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Of these, 170 patients underwent LAR and 92 patients were treated with APER. The majority of the resections were performed laparoscopically (LAR 82.4%, APER 68.5%), by highly experienced surgeons assisted by a senior registrar/fellow. Patient characteristics and treatment details are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Overall, the majority of patients was male (72%) with no significant difference in the male/female distribution between the groups. Patients in the APER group were significantly older, p = 0.040, with no significant difference in ASA score and BMI.
