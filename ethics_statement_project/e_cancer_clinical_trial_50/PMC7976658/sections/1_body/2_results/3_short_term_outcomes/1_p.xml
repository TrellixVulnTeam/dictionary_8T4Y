<p id="Par25">Patients in the APER groups had a significantly longer length of primary hospital stay compared to LAR patients, p &lt; 0.001. Overall, the post-operative complications rate was higher in the APER group compared to the LAR group, p = 0.028, see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. Amongst both groups only one APER patient died of a myocardial infarction within 30 days of the operation. Ten LAR patients had to return to theatre, 6 for an anastomotic leak, 2 cases for abdominal sepsis and 2 cases for loop ileostomy related complications. In the APER group, again, 10 patients had to return to theatre, but for different reasons; 4 patients for stoma related complications, 3 cases for intra-abdominal sepsis and 3 patients needed a small bowel resection.
