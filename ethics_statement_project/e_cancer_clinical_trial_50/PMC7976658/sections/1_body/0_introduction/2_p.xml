<p id="Par11">At present, a safe margin is considered to be a distal mural margin of 1–2 cm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For low rectal tumors a one cm distal margin is accepted because distal intramural spread occurs over 1 cm in only 4% to 10% of the cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This knowledge, that a distal margin of 1 cm is considered to be oncologically safe, means that in theory an anastomosis can be made at almost any level in the pelvis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Whenever safe margins cannot be achieved, a non-restorative procedure is still the treatment of choice. Such is the case when the CRM is involved, with involved Extra Mural Vascular Invasion (EMVI), locally advanced lesions with poor response to neoadjuvant therapy and with tumours with external sphincter or levator ani muscle invasion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].
