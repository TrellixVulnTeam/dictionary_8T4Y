<p id="Par20">Statistical analyses was performed using SPSS version 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Data was expressed as median with inter-quartile ranges. Intergroup comparisons were made using a Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables or chi squared or Fishers exact test for categorical variables. A difference with a p value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. Kaplan–Meier survival plots and the log rank test were used to compare disease-free and overall survival between the two groups. Cox regression analysis was performed on all available factors.</p>
