Survival data was last updated on the 30th of June 2017. Disease-free survival was defined as the time from the date of primary treatment (surgery) to the date of first recurrence, be it local, systemic or both if they had occurred 6 months apart. Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of the primary treatment to the date of death. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the type of procedure, the LAR and the APER group.</p>
