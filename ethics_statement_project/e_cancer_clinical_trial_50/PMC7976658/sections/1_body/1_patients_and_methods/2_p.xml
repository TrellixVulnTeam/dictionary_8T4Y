Patients were offered surgery following a consensus decision by the local Colorectal Multidisciplinary Team (cr-MDT) after deciding the need for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Long course chemoradiotherapy was given to T4 rectal cancers or those with a threatened or involved circumferential resection margin (CRM) on MRI. Curative resection was performed either by an open approach or laparoscopically according to the TME principle.
