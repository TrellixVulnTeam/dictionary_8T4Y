<p id="Par35">We have a robust mechanism to ensure data quality. At first, the data enumerators will receive intensive training on the process of data collection. The principal investigator will monitor the data enumerators on a day-to-day basis. The research assistant assigned for data entry will inspect the data manually and enter the data in EpiData software file (EpiData Association, Odense, Denmark). Double entry for 10% of the data will qualify potential errors in data entry quality. The research officer will crosscheck the data quality on the spot and in our field office for any incomplete, inconsistent, and invalid data. Any deviation in the data quality will require recollecting in the field.</p>
