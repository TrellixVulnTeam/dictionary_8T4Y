<p id="Par24">After randomization, the FCHVs in intervention wards will receive training coordinated by the research team in collaboration and close supervision of the local health authority. The training manual is designed under the guidance of experts in cervical cancer and public health from the national and international organizations. The training manual is based on the following: training of community health workers, WHO, 2017 training manual [

The FCHVs will receive a 3-day training package highlighting: (a) an introduction to NCDs and cervical cancer, (b) cervical cancer causes and risk factors, (c) cervical cancer screening and service availability, (d) providing health education and counseling women (30–60 years), and (e) recording, reporting, and follow-up.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and training materials will be reviewed and validated by experts and major stakeholders. The developed training materials will be pretested with the FCHVs from a nearby area not included in the study. In addition, the FCHVs will also receive health education materials (pamphlets), referral cards, and a recording register during the training session.
