<p id="Par29">A field supervisor will routinely visit each FCHV in order to maintain motivation and collection of records from the health facilities. The supervisor also provides ad hoc help to the FCHVs when needed during the intervention period. We will also use a supervision checklist to track and update the knowledge and skill levels of FCHVs as well as to ensure fidelity to the study protocol.</p>
