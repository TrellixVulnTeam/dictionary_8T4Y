<p id="Par16">The proposed trial is a community-based, 12-month, open label, two-arm cRCT with an equal allocation of clusters (geographical wards) between intervention and control arms in a semi-urban area of Pokhara Metropolitan city (former Lekhnath municipality, administratively divided in to 15 wards). It is one of the two areas where the Cervical Cancer Screening and Prevention (CCSP) pilot program was first initiated in Nepal. The total population of Lekhnath municipality is 59,498 (female 32,104 and male 27,394) with the total number of households being 14,958 as per the 2011 census [

Although the study area is composed of 15 clusters, only 14 will be selected for the cluster randomization (one cluster that is comparatively different from others in socio-demography and health service availability is excluded). Allocation of the clusters into intervention and control arms is described below. The study area is limited to health services comprising one recently upgraded 25-bedded hospital from a primary health care center, three health posts, and six urban health care centers. According to the District Public Health Office, Kaski in 2018, there were 123 FCHVs in the municipality.
