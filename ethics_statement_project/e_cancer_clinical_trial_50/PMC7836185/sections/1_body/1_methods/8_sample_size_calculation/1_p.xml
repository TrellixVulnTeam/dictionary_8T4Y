<p id="Par23">The sample size for the baseline survey is calculated based on the method suggested by the WHO STEPWISE Approach [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]: for our study, we calculate 884 participants with 20% non-response. A systematic random sampling method will be performed as a sampling technique. For the power calculation, we took reference from a quasi-experimental study from Nigeria that reported an effect size of 5% between intervention and control group during a 13-week period [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. We expect an effect size of 10% increase in our study with a 1-year follow-up where FCHVs are mobilized to conduct home visit counseling once every 3Â months and the intervention takes place in an ongoing community-based program for non-communicable diseases from 2014 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Assuming, 20% loss to follow-up and ICC of 0.01 and seven clusters per arm will provide 90% power resulting to 49 women per cluster. The total sample size needed for the intervention study is 690 that will be recruited from the 884 participants (baseline survey), which is enough to obtain 90% power.
