<p id="Par33">STATA version 15 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) will be used for quantitative analysis following the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines for cluster-randomized trials. Flowcharts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) will include the number of participants seen at each stage of the trial, eligible, randomized, and analyzed for the primary outcome. In the initial analysis, we will compare baseline characteristics of enrolled participants in the study arms and follow-up status. We will use mixed-effect logistic regression to compare between the groups as the outcome (the primary outcome would be the difference in the proportion of women who participate in the cervical cancer-screening program between intervention and control within 1 year). Comparison of the knowledge scores between baseline and follow-up, after 1-year intervention, will measure the knowledge level. Estimation will take into account the effect of potential confounders (age, ethnicity, education, parity, income, location, etc.).
