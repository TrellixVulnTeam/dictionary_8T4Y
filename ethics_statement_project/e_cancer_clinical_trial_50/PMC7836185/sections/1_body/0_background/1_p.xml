<p id="Par11">Cervical cancer is a common cancer among women in most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in Asia, Africa, and Latin America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is the major cause of cancer deaths among women in Nepal with an estimated 2942 new cases and 1928 deaths in 2018 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Screening is one of the most effective tools for early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, there are very limited tools and skilled health professionals available for cervical cancer screening in many LMICs, including Nepal. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Alliance for Cervical Cancer Prevention (ACCP) recommend that countries, areas, or institutions seeking to initiate or strengthen cervical cancer screening programs should consider introducing or expanding visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) until more appropriate and affordable HPV-based tests become available [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A single-visit approach with VIA and cryotherapy has been shown to be a safe, acceptable, feasible and is a potentially efficient method of cervical cancer prevention in Nepal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. National guidelines for the prevention and screening of cervical cancer includes VIA as a screening method for cervical cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Studies reveal that participation of Nepalese women for cervical cancer screening is still low [2.8% (25–64 years); 1.5% (15–49 years); 5.4% (30–65 years)] [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, there is a need for appropriate, cost-effective, and sustainable interventions to increase VIA screening uptake at the primary health care level across Nepal.
