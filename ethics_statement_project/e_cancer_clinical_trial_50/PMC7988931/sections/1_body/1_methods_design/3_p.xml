<p id="Par39">In PRIME-HCC the dosing schedule adopted is 1 mg/kg dose Q6W for ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q3W for a total of 2 cycles. The rationale for dose selection stems from the clinical experience in the use of the combination across a number of indications. In the specific setting of HCC, whilst there is currently no clinical data available to illustrate the safety and tolerability of the planned regimen administered sequentially with LR, similar dosing schedules including a six-weekly dosing of ipilimumab at 1 mg/kg and three-weekly dosing of nivolumab at 3 mg/kg have been explored in CA209–040 cohort 4. Extrapolating from CA209–040 safety data, ipilimumab dose intensity appears to be the strongest determinant of toxicity, in particular with regards to immune-related liver TRAEs: study treatment in Arms B and C, where ipilimumab dose intensitiy was lower, was shown to be better tolerable compared to more intense ipilimumab dosing schedules (3 mg/kg in Arm A). For this reason, PRIME-HCC will utilise the lowest effective dose intensity schedule (1 mg/kg Q6W) and combine it with nivolumab at the clinically approved dose of 3 mg/kg Q3W. The choice of this combination will maintain individual exposures that are optimally consistent with those associated with maximal efficacy response in other indications and that are tolerated and safe, especially considering liver-related TRAEs in a patient population where cirrhosis and concomitant chronic viral infection is highly prevalent.</p>
