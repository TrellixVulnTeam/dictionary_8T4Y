<p id="Par41">Participants will require a full hepatitis serology screen prior to enrolment into the study, this includes Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C Virus serology. In patients with positive serology for either virus, baseline HBV DNA and HCV quantitative RNA levels will be requested. Participants who are confirmed to have chronic and active hepatitis B and/or C (i.e. with detectable HBV DNA or HCV RNA at baseline) will have their viral load (HCV RNA and/or HBV DNA as appropriate) monitored at each cycle and at the end of treatment follow-up visit.</p>
