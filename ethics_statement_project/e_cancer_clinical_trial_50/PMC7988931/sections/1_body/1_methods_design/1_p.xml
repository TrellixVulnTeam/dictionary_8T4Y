<p id="Par37">PRIME HCC is a two-part, phase Ib study of ipilimumab and nivolumab combination prior to LR in adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with HCC. Ipilimumab will be administered once only on Day 1. Nivolumab will be administered on Day 1 and Day 22 (± 3 days) for a total of two 21-day cycles (i.e. 6 weeks of treatment). Part 1 of the study will initially consist of a safety run-in phase of 6 participants. If two or fewer surgical delays are observed, the study will continue to Part 2, which will consist of an expansion phase including up to 26 participants. All participants entered into the study will receive nivolumab and ipilimumab for a fixed duration of 6 weeks of treatment. The study flow-chart is summarized in Fig.
