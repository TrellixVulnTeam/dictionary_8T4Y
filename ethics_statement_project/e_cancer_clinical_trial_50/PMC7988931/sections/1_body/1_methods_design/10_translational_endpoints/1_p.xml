<p id="Par53">Alongside primary clinical endpoints, PRIME-HCC will generate a biorepository of peripheral blood, tissue, stool and urine samples collected at different study timepoints (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Tissue samples pre- and post-immunotherapy will undergo multi-colour immune profiling to evaluate the expression of PD ligands and a panel of other immune checkpoints evaluated in co-expression with CD4, CD8, CD20, CD56, CD68 and FoxP3 to verify their immunologic role in relationship to the peri-tumoural infiltrate. Following macro-dissection and total RNA extraction, targeted transcriptomic profiling using the Nanostring PanCancer Immune panel will be used to evaluate enrichment of 770 genes pertaining to 24 immune cell types in pre-and post-treatment tissue samples. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be profiled using flow cytometry to differentiate relative abundance T-cytotoxic (CD3
 <sup>+</sup>/CD8
 <sup>+</sup>), T-helper (CD3
 <sup>+</sup>/CD4
 <sup>+</sup>/CD25
 <sup>−</sup>) and T-reg cells (CD3
 <sup>+</sup>/CD4
 <sup>+</sup>/CD25
 <sup>high</sup>) and downstream transcriptome analysis will decipher the relative functional contribution of individual T-cell subsets in influencing response to ICPI. Lastly, we will perform plasma and urinary metabolic phenotyping and stool metagenomic analysis to evaluate the contribution of the gut microbiota and associated metabolites in influencing response to neoadjuvant ICI therapy.
