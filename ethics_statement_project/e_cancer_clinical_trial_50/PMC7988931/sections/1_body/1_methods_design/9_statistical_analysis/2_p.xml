<p id="Par52">All participants who receive at least one dose of IMP will be included in the safety analysis set. All participants who receive at least one dose of the IMP and undergo disease re-evaluation as per protocol will be included in the efficacy analysis. Due to the exploratory nature of the study with regards to efficacy endpoints, pathologic response rates and RECIST 1.1 response rates will be presented descriptively. The exploratory endpoint of PFS rate will be shown with Kaplan-Meier plots using the full timespan from the start of IMP administration until the date of progression or death from any cause. Proportions of participants who do not progress and who are alive at Day 127 (FU2) and 4-monthly time-points thereafter will also be estimated. For the exploratory endpoints, appropriate descriptive analysis and univariable regression analysis will be conducted.</p>
