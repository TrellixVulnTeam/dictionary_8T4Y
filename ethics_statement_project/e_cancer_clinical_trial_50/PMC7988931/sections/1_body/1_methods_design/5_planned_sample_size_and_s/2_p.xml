<p id="Par46">With the primary endpoint being safety, no power calculation for hypothesis testing is required to formally power the study: the upper 95% confidence interval for toxicity events will inform the decision to proceed to a future, adequately powered, phase II trial. Part 1 of the study will initially require a total of 6 patients. If â‰¤2 surgical. Delays are observed (primary safety endpoint), the study will continue to Part 2 following Independent Safety Data Monitoring Committee review of preliminary safety data. A second interim analysis will be performed when 100% of the recruited patients have completed study follow-up visit 2 (FU2) to evaluate general safety and tolerability of the combination.</p>
