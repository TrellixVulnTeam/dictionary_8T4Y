<p id="Par33">In HCC, safety and preliminary efficacy of 3 alternative schedules of nivolumab and ipilimumab have been investigated within the cohort 4 of Checkmate-040. Pre-treated patients with Child-Pugh class A advanced disease have been randomised to receive either nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg or nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg or every 3 weeks for four doses followed by maintenance nivolumab monotherapy (240 mg flat dose biweekly) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The further arm evaluated nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. The incidence of treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) for the whole cohort was 37% with a 5% discontinuation rate. The efficacy analysis showed the nivolumab/ipilimumab combination to achieve an ORR of 31%, which was higher than the ORR (14%) reported with single agent nivolumab in the same study, and led to US Food and Drug Administration approval of the nivolumab/ipilimumab combination in treatment-experienced advanced HCC patients [
