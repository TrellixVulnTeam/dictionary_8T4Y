<p id="Par31">Anti-tumour immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies blocking the programmed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) pathways are gaining momentum, where immune checkpoint inhibitors directed against these targets either alone or in combination have shown efficacy in HCC. Pembrolizumab has shown initial evidence of disease-modulating activity in a little less than 20% of patients enrolled in Keynote-224 [
