<p id="Par34">The rapidly changing landscape of systemic therapy in HCC, where combination immunotherapy has led to reproducible evidence of disease-modulation, has prompted clinicians to consider the expansion of immunotherapy to the earlier stages of the disease. There is an acute need for highly active systemic anti-cancer treatments as a pre-operative strategy to attempt disease down-staging and expand the proportion of patients who might benefit from curative surgery. Furthermore, despite optimal local control of the disease, the majority of patients recur within 2â€‰years of surgery as a likely result of proliferation of microscopic neoplastic foci within the residual organ, and the 5-year survival rate for early-stage HCC ranges between 17 to 53%, with a recurrence rat that can reach 70% also in the curative resection setting [

The negative impact on survival secondary to both early and late recurrence of HCC suggests the need for an optimal integration of systemic anti-cancer therapies to control the risk of relapse and increase the chances of cure in patients with early stage HCC.
