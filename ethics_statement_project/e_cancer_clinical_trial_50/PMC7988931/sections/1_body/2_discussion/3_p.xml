<p id="Par56">Despite optimal surgical control of the disease, patients with HCC are at high risk of recurrence after LR. Currently, there is no standard of care for neoadjuvant therapy, although a number of approaches have been attempted. The study of immune-checkpoint inhibitors in the preoperative setting of HCC is an ideal scenario to enable comprehensive evaluation of predictive correlates of response to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitors. The results of this study will help to define the role of neoadjuvant nivolumab/ipilimumab combination in the management of HCC, with potential to improve survival outcomes in this patient population.</p>
