<p id="Par55">The study of immune-checkpoint inhibitors in the preoperative setting of HCC is an ideal scenario to enable comprehensive evaluation of predictive correlates of response to treatment. Therapeutic expansion of immunotherapy to early stage patients, however, is accompanied by a number of clinical concerns that require to be addressed prospectively. Firstly, from a safety point of view, concurrent liver failure stemming from underlying cirrhosis and active hepatotropic viral infection makes the interaction between immune checkpoint inhibition and surgical resection a clinical scenario deserving comprehensive safety evaluation. Secondly, there is an inherent lack of efficacy data to confirm the sensitivity of early stage, treatment-na√Øve HCC patients to immune checkpoint inhibition. This is a highly relevant point in generalizing the efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 agents across all the stages of HCC, especially given that the majority of patients that have been previously recruited to clinical trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors may have had loco-regional therapies (radiofrequency ablation or TACE). These treatments are widely renowned inducers of immunogenic cell death that might have exerted a priming effect on the immune system by facilitating a broader access to otherwise inaccessible neo-epitopes. Confirmation of the bioactivity of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab in early stage HCC, where the biology of the disease may significantly differ from that of relapsed or advanced disease, is therefore an important research aim to allow optimal allocation of checkpoint blockade in the treatment paradigm of patients with HCC.</p>
