<p id="Par54">PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and CTLA-4 inhibitors, either alone or in combination represent a promising peri-operative therapeutic option. A single dose of pre-operative pembrolizumab, can induce near complete pathologic responses in 19% of stage III/IV resectable melanoma patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Preliminary efficacy reports suggest even higher rates of complete pathologic response ranging from 7 to 45% from neoadjuvant nivolumab/ipilimumab therapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In NSCLC, neoadjuvant checkpoint blockade leads to a higher proportion of major pathologic responses compared to chemotherapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and the phase II NEOSTAR trial, has shown that treatment with nivolumab/ipilimumab leads to higher major pathological responses (33%) compared to nivolumab (17%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Similar positive results have been seen in non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer, where two studies have reported complete response rates of 40 and 29% after up to 3 doses of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. A recent phase Ib study of sequential nivolumab/ipilimumab followed by surgery reported pathological complete responses in 45% of patients, although 54% of the patients experienced grade 3â€“4 immune-related adverse events (irAEs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Importantly, alongside the efficacy data, no unexpected surgical delays/complications were reported, and the safety profile appeared improved over chemotherapy also in the neoadjuvant setting [
