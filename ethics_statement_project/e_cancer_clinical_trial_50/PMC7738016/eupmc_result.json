The present study is being conducted to confirm the safety and efficacy of the additional use of tranilast with conventional preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with advanced ESCC.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>Between 56 and 59 patients aged between 20 and 74 years with clinically diagnosed Stage II or Stage III ESCC will be enrolled. Eligible patients will receive preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, 2 cycles of combination therapy with cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and tranilast.

The pathological therapeutic effect is the primary endpoint. The objective response rate, safety of preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) are the secondary endpoints. RFS and OS will be calculated as the time from surgery to first recurrence and all-cause death, respectively.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>This protocol has been approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine and all participating hospitals in August 30, 2019 (Number: CRB5180001).
