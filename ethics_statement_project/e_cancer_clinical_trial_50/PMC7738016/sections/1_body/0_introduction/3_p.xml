<p>Despite multidisciplinary treatments, ESCC cells may acquire treatment resistance, persist, and ultimately cause recurrence. Previous studies reported that a large number of solid tumors include a minor subset of cancer cells called cancer stem cells (CSCs).

 </sup> These cells have the characteristics of stem cells, such as self-replication ability and pluripotency, exhibit resistance to anticancer drugs and radiation, and are critically involved in tumor initiation, progression, recurrence, and metastasis, ultimately resulting in patient death.

 </sup> We previously demonstrated that the expression levels of transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2), a nonspecific cation channel, were very high in the CSCs of ESCC.

 </sup> The cytotoxicity of tranilast, an analog of a tryptophan metabolite and a TRPV2 inhibitor, was shown to be more potent at a lower concentration in CSCs than in non-CSCs.

 </sup> It has been used to treat patients with inflammatory diseases, such as asthma, dermatitis, allergic conjunctivitis, keloids, and hypertrophic scars.

 </sup> The safety of tranilast for clinical use has already been demonstrated.
