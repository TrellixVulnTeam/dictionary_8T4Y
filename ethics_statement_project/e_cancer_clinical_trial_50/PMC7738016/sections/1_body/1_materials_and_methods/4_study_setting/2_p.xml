<p>The study is an investigator-initiated, prospective intervention phase I/II trial to investigate the efficacy of the additional use of tranilast using comparisons with historical control data from patients who previously received conventional preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (5-FU/CDDP) in our institute. Patients will provide written informed consent before their registration, which is in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Following an independent review by the Center for Quality Assurance in Research and Development, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, patients will be registered in the present study. In accordance with the Japanese clinical trial guidelines, at least annual independent monitoring is planned.</p>
