<p>Baseline status of physical status of the participants and their baseline findings of their esophageal carcinoma, endoscopy, computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography CT (PET-CT), are evaluated before the treatment begins. The patients hospitalize into our hospital just before the start date of the treatment; subsequently, physical status, and laboratory data are regularly checked by the physicians in charge of their hospital care. The status of tumor is re-evaluated using endoscopy, CT, and PET-CT 1 month after the treatment, and chemotherapeutic effect is diagnosed according to RECIST ver 1.1. If unresectable factors are not being found in the reevaluation of tumor, the patients will undergo curative surgery for their esophageal carcinoma. The pathological diagnosis of resected specimens is determined by expert pathologists according to Japanese Classification of Esophageal Cancer, 11th Edition.
