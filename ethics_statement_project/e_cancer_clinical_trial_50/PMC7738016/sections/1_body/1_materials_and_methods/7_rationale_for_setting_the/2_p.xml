 </sup>) in 19% of patients. Therefore, expected and threshold rates are 34% and 19%, respectively. Under these conditions, 48 subjects will be required based on the assumption of a 1-sided alpha error of 0.05 and beta error of 0.2. In consideration of dropouts, the sample size is set at 50 patients for the phase II trial. Between 9 and 15 patients will be required to establish MTD (phase I trial). Data from 3 of these patients with established MTD will be used for the phase II trial. Therefore, the total sample size has been set at 56 to 59 patients in the present trial.
