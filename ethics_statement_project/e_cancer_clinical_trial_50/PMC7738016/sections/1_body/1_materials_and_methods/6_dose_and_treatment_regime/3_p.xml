<p>Toxicities will be assessed based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined by the occurrence of severe toxicities, CTCAE grade 4 or 5. The CTCAE grade 4 adverse reactions which often occur during CDDP and 5FU therapy, such as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, stomatitis, and diarrhea, will be excluded from DLT.</p>
