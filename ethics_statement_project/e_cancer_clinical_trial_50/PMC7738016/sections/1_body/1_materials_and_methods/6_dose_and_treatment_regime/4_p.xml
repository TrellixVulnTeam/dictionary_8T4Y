<p>To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of tranilast, 200 mg/day tranilast will be administered to the first 3 patients. If 2 cycles of combination therapy are successively completed without DLT, 300 mg/day tranilast will be administered to the next 3 patients. The dose of tranilast will gradually be increased to 600 mg/day, and the appropriate MTD will be established (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This clinical study will be stopped when DLT occurs at 200 mg/day tranilast (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Dose modifications will be permitted when DLT occurs at 300 or 600 mg/day tranilast (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).
