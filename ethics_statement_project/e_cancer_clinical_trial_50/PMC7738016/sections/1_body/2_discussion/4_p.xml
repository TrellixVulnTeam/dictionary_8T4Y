<p>However, increases in the blood level of tranilast have been shown to induce hemorrhagic cystitis because its metabolites cause bladder inflammation. Although caution is needed when increasing the dose of tranilast, a large-scale clinical trial that used 900 mg/day of tranilast as single agent administration has already been conducted.

 </sup> In that clinical trial, the occurrence of side effects was not affected by the loading of tranilast, and, thus, we considered the risk of increments in tranilast in the present study to be within the tolerance level. In consideration of the safety of the additional use of tranilast with 5-FU/CDDP, we decided to start with a low dose of tranilast (200 mg/day), and aim to load up to 600 mg/day. The TNAC study will provide data on appropriate neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy with tranilast for Stage II, III ESCC patients.
