<p>A recent study demonstrated that ion channels/transporters are critically involved in the various fundamental functions of cancer cells, and are expressed at high levels in CSCs.

 </sup> Our findings on gene expression profiles revealed that the expression levels of several genes encoding ion channels including TRPV2 were elevated in the CSCs of ESCC, suggesting the potential of selective inhibitors of ion channels/transporters as targeted therapeutic agents against CSCs.

 </sup> The inhibitory effects of tranilast on the IgE-induced release of chemical mediators from mast cells have already been demonstrated, and it has been used to treat various inflammatory diseases. Its potential targets include a number of important molecules, such as TRPV2. Tranilast was recently suggested to exhibit antitumor activity against various types of cancers, including breast cancer, gastric cancer, and ESCC.

 </sup> Regarding its effects on CSCs, we reported a novel mechanism by which tranilast suppresses CSCs that involves the inhibition of TRPV2.
