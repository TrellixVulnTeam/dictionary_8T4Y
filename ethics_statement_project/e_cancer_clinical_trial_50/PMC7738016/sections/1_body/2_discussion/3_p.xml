<p>The conventional dose of tranilast for bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, keloid, and hypertrophic scars is 300 mg/day (100 mg orally 3 times a day). The internal use of 100 mg tranilast was previously shown to increase the maximal blood level up to 17.1 ± 0.55 μg/mL in healthy subjects. On the other hand, our in vitro study revealed that the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was 31.4 μmol/L (10.2 μg/mL), whereas IC
 <sub>80</sub> was 113 μmol/L (36.7 μg/mL) in the CSCs of ESCC.

 </sup> If the concentrations of tranilast in the in vitro study correlate with blood levels to some extent, loading for internal use to 2-fold may increase inhibitory effects on CSCs in vivo. Therefore, in the present study, we decided to increase the quantity to double the conventional dose, 600 mg/day, by taking 200 mg orally 3 times a day.
