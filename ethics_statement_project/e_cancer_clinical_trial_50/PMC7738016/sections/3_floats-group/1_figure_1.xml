  <p>Establishing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of tranilast. Initially, 200 mg/day tranilast will be administered to the first 3 patients. If 2 cycles of combination therapy are successfully completed without dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), 300 mg/day tranilast will be administered to the next 3 patients. The dose of tranilast will gradually be increased up to 600 mg/day, and the appropriate MTD will be established. This study will be stopped when DLT occurs at 200 mg/day tranilast. Dose modifications are allowed when DLT occurs at 300 or 600 mg/day tranilast. DLT: grade 4 toxicity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.</p>
