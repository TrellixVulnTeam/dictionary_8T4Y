<p>By searching the searching the literature in different databases (ie, behind Medline) and also study registers (eg, ClinicalTrials.gov), all relevant completed but also ongoing studies comparing surveillance with surgery on demand in esophaegeal cancer will be identified. Finally the results of the scoping review will reveal (1) whether the diagnostic methods used and the definition for complete responders were appropriate and homogeneous, (2) whether the included sample sizes were sufficient to draw conclusions on benefits and harms, (3) what interventions were considered (eg, nCRT and/or chemotherapeutic protocols), (4) what outcomes of interest were covered, (5) whether follow-up times were sufficient and (6) whether clinical results across studies are homogeneous. We believe that the planned randomised trial will benefit from this state-of-the art research approach, and therefore, will provide patients, clinicians and other stakeholders with high evidence considering various patient-relevant outcomes when comparing these two treatment approaches.</p>
