<p>Overall, the final goal will be the development and verification of a protocol to identify patients with pathological complete response (based on reliable diagnostic methods and definitions for complete responders) who would not need to undergo high-risk surgery in the increasing subgroup of postneoadjuvant complete responders. This treatment procedure is expected to reduce morbidity and mortality rates, and increase quality of life. Regarding the socioeconomic impact, omission of oesophagectomy reduces treatment duration, complication rates and time of hospital stay. This results in reduced treatment costs and a faster return to normal life for this patient population.</p>
