<p>Although the scoping review may not provide effect estimates including an evaluation of the certainty of evidence, it will be of great value to crystallise research questions, and the extent of available evidence by highlighting areas where evidence is lacking. The scoping review will support us to map the existing primary research for potential duplications. Furthermore, it will provide an overview of the (1) characteristics and definitions of patient populations (included in available studies) and settings, (2) details on the interventions (including type of neoadjuvant therapy, time between neoadjuvant therapy and surgery, definition of surveillance), (3) details on the diagnostic methods used for postneoadjuvant tumour staging, (4) definition of complete responders, (5) outcome measures and (6) follow-up times. Hence the scoping process will allow us to systematically develop the concept of the randomised trial based on current knowledge (including pitfalls) in this newly emerging treatment area.</p>
