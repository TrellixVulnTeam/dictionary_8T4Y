<p>Randomised controlled trials; non-randomised controlled studies (using strategies of non-random allocation for assigning interventions) and observational studies (with control group) will be eligible for the scoping review. We will not consider single arm studies. Due to a missing control group within this study design. The reason for this exclusion is that studies without a control group provide no reliable data to estimate comparative effectiveness and will, therefore, not be useful for the planned randomised trial. Furthermore, review articles, clinical guidelines and work that has not been peer-reviewed (eg, thesis, editorials, letters, comments) will be excluded.</p>
