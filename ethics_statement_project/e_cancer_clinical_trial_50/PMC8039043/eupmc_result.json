Patients in Group L received lidocaine with a 1.5 mg/kg bolus before induction of anesthesia, followed by 2.0 mg/kg/h until the end of the operation while the patients in Group C received volume-matched normal saline at the same rate.

The peak airway pressure (Ppeak) and plateau airway pressure (Pplat), the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO<sub>2</sub>), partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO<sub>2</sub>), alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (A-aDO2), oxygenation index (OI), time to first flatus and defecation, intraoperative hemodynamics and opioid consumption were also recorded.<h4>Results</h4>There were no statistically difference at patients' baseline characteristics. The QoR-40 score of Group L was significantly higher than that of Group C at 24 h after surgery (<i>P</i>=0.014).
