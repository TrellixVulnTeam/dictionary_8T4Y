<p>A total of 98 patients were screened to participate in the trial, of which 20 were excluded. Three of these patients were excluded as they were treated with aspirin for a long time, and another 4 patients were excluded as they suffered from sinus bradycardia. After being enrolled, 8 more patients were excluded. Two of these patients were excluded as they were treated with aspirin for a long time, and 1 patient was excluded as newly discovered sinus bradycardia. Thirty-five people were randomly assigned to each group. In Group L, two cases were admitted to ICU after the operation, and one case was converted to thoracotomy during operation. One case in Group C was admitted to ICU after the operation, and one case was converted to thoracotomy during operation.
