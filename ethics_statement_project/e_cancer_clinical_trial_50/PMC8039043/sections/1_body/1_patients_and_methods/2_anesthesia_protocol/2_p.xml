<p>Arterial blood samples were collected intermittently during the operation for blood gas analysis to maintain a stable internal environment. When hypoxemia (SpO
 <sub>2</sub> &lt; 90%) occurred during the operation, fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed to confirm that the double-lumen endotracheal tube was well aligned. If there was no improvement in the sputum suction, positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation, and other measures, double lung ventilation was performed and the occurrence of hypoxemia was recorded during the operation. Postoperative patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCA) was performed with drug formulations (sufentanil 2 μg/kg, dezocine 10 mg, tropisetron 10 mg, normal saline diluted to 100 mL) using a set lock time of 15 min, a background infusion dose to 2 mL/h, and the PCA was set at 0.5 mL of/times to maintain the visual analogue scale (VAS) below or equal to 3 points. Cisatracurium was stopped before the end of the operation. All narcotic drugs were also stopped at the end of the operation, and the patient was taken to post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) with a tube. More precisely, neostigmine 0.04–0.07 mg/kg was given when the second twitch response (T2) of TOF spontaneously recovered, and the maximum dose was 5 mg. Atropine and neostigmine were injected slowly with the same syringe, atropine dose was generally half of neostigmine, and the depth of muscle relaxation was continuously monitored in the process. When the consciousness, cough, and swallowing reflex of the patient were recovered, the head was lifted from the bed surface for 5 s, the tidal volume was more than 5 mL/kg, TOF ratio (T4/T1) was &gt;0.9 and the respiratory rate was less than 20 times/min, patient was extubated and after a 30-min observation, the patient was sent back to the ward.
