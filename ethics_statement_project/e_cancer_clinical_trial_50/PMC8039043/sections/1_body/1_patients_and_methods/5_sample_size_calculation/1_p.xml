<p>This study design involved a parallel randomized controlled study, whereby the QoR-40 score was compared between the intervention Group L and the control Group C. According to previous literature reports, an average increase of 10 points in the total QoR-40 scores indicates that the quality of clinical recovery has improved. On this basis, we assumed that the QoR-40 score of Group L was 10 points higher than that of Group C at 24 h postoperatively, with a standard deviation of 13, α of 0.05, and β of 0.2. Assuming a 20% patient dropout rate, we calculated that a sample size of 35 patients per group is required. Seventy patients were finally included (n=70).</p>
