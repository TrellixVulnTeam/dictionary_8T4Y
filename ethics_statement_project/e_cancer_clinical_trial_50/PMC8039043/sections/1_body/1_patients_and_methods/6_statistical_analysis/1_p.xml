<p>SPSS statistical software (version 25.0; SPSS Inc., IBM, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical data analysis; The measurement data used the Shapiro–Wilk test to determine the normality of the data distribution, and the Levene method was used to test the homogeneity of variance. The measurement data that meet the normal distribution were expressed as the mean± standard deviation (
