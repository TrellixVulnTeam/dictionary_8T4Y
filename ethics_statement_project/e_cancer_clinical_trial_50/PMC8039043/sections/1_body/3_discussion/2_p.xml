<p>Damage to organs such as pleura and lung tissue can put the body in a state of stress, and excessive stress response seriously affects the prognosis of patients. During intraoperative OLV, airway pressure increases, lung compliance decreases, and the non-ventilated lung completely collapses, while still receiving part of the cardiac output from the right ventricle, resulting in an intrapulmonary shunt. Although the ventilation volume and pulmonary blood flow of the ventilated lung are increased, the V
 <sub>A</sub>/Q ratio cannot be completely normalized. In OLV, the intrapulmonary shunt flow can reach 20â€“40%.
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Increased intrapulmonary shunt rate leads to pulmonary venous blood adulteration, which can produce hypoxemia. The results of this test showed that the PO
 <sub>2</sub> and OI of the L group were significantly increased after the patient resumed bilateral lung ventilation for 20 min, and A-aDO
 <sub>2</sub>, Ppeak, and Pplat were significantly reduced. A-aDO
 <sub>2</sub> and OI had a good correlation with the intrapulmonary shunt rate, suggesting that lidocaine reduces the shunt rate in the lungs to a certain extent. Various mechanisms have been proposed on how lidocaine can reduce lung damage. In an animal study,
 <xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> it was demonstrated that lidocaine can play a lung-protective effect by reducing endothelial cell damage caused by the inflammatory response, while also reducing the expression of adhesion molecules, and shedding enzymes. Another study showed
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> that lidocaine can reduce lung injury caused by ischemia/reperfusion injury.
