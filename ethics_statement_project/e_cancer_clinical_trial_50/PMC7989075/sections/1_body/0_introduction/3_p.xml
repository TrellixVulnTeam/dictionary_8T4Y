<p id="Par33">Neoadjuvant therapy has been proposed to overcome the drawbacks associated with upfront surgery. Single-arm studies on neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy, have reported favorable outcomes. A meta-analysis of 38 studies with 3843 patients with resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer found superior OS by intention-to-treat (ITT) (18.8 vs. 14.8 months) and higher R0 resection rates (87% vs. 67%;

The addition of radiotherapy to chemotherapy has been suggested to improve R0 resection rate and decrease local recurrence rate, with the potential to improve OS. A recent Korean randomized phase II-III trial was closed early after inclusion of 50 patients because of superior survival with neoadjuvant versus adjuvant gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy at interim analysis (21 vs. 12 months,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Although this study did not meet the primary endpoint of OS by ITT (16.0 vs. 14.3 months, 
 <italic>p =</italic> 0.096), all secondary outcomes found superiority of the neoadjuvant arm: R0 resection rate (71% vs. 40%;
