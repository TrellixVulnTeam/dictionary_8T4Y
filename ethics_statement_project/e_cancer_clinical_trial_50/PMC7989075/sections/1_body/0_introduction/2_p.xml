<p id="Par32">Upfront surgery with adjuvant gemcitabine has long been the standard of care for patients with resectable pancreatic cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Over the past decade, multiple randomized trials have focused on adjuvant therapy, with gradually improving OS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Unfortunately, only a subgroup of patients with localized pancreatic cancer receive the intended upfront surgery and adjuvant therapy. First, 10–20% of patients who are scheduled for surgical exploration do not undergo resection, because metastatic or locally unresectable disease is found at surgery that was not anticipated on imaging [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. An exploratory laparotomy without resection has considerable mortality, morbidity, and a prolonged reduced quality of life. Most of these patients fail to receive palliative chemotherapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Second, many patients (40–50%) do not recover from a resection sufficiently or in time to tolerate adjuvant chemotherapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Third, recurrence within 6 months after surgery can occur in up to 50% of patients who do not receive adjuvant chemotherapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is unlikely that these patients derived any benefit from surgery. Hence, with upfront surgery, too many patients with the initial diagnosis of resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer undergo futile surgery and too few patients receive systemic chemotherapy, while the majority of patients have occult metastatic disease at presentation.
