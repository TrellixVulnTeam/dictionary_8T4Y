<p id="Par35">Neoadjuvant therapy appears the most appropriate choice for most patients with localized disease. A direct comparison of FOLFIRINOX to gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting has not yet been performed in a phase III trial. Our primary objective is to determine if total neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX results in superior OS compared with neoadjuvant gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant gemcitabine for patients with resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.</p>
