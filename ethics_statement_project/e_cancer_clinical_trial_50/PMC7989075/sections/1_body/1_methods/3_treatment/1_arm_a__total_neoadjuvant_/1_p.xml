<p id="Par40">Treatment in arm A starts with four cycles of neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX, followed by a restaging CT-scan. Patients with treatment response or stable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria are scheduled for an additional four cycles of neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX. Restaging CT-scan is repeated and when appropriate followed by surgical exploration with intended resection. No adjuvant chemotherapy is scheduled. Cycles are repeated every 2 weeks (Fig.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Starting with a modified regimen is allowed in patients older than 75â€‰years or at the discretion of the treating physician, including withholding of the fluorouracil bolus or dose reduction of irinotecan and oxaliplatin to 80%. Fluorouracil dose should be adjusted or withheld in patients with a (partial) deficiency of the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme. Primary prophylaxis with (Peg) Filgrastim (G-CSF) after every cycle of FOLFIRINOX is strongly recommended. Dose adjustments during treatment should be based on the maximum graded toxicity within the previous cycle.
