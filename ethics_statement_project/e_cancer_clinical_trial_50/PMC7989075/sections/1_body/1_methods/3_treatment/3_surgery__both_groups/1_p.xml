<p id="Par42">Patients are eligible for a surgical exploration if they have non-metastatic resectable or borderline resectable disease on restaging CT-scan of the chest and abdomen. Surgery is performed 3 to 6 weeks after completion of chemotherapy. Surgery starts with a staging laparoscopy (during the same surgical procedure), followed by the standard surgical exploration and resection depending on the location of the tumor. Postoperative complications are defined according to the Clavien-Dindo classification and definitions of post-pancreatic surgery complications (i.e. pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, and bleeding) according to the International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS), recorded until 90 days after surgery [

Patients with distant metastasis or unresectable disease at restaging or surgery continue with standard palliative care according to the national guideline.
