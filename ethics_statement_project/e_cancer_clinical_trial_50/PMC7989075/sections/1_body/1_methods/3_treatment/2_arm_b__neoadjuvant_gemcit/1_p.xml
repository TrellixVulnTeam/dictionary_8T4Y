<p id="Par41">Treatment in arm B starts with three cycles of neoadjuvant gemcitabine, adding hypofractionated radiotherapy (36 Gy in 15 fractions during 3 weeks) to the second cycle. Gemcitabine is given weekly for 3 weeks (day 1, 8, and 15) in subsequent 4-week courses, at a dose of 1000 mg per square meter of body-surface area. The first and third cycle are modified to a 3-week course (day 1 and 8). After neoadjuvant therapy, a restaging CT-scan is performed and when appropriate followed by surgical exploration with intended resection. After resection, four cycles of adjuvant gemcitabine are administered (Fig.
