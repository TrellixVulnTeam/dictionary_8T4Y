<p id="Par44">Progression-free survival is defined as survival without any locoregional progressive disease, distant metastases, recurrence, or secondary pancreatic cancer, calculated from the date of randomization. Death from any cause is also considered an event for this endpoint. Patients alive and free of these events will be censored at the last follow-up. For locoregional progression-free interval and distant metastases-free interval, only progression is considered an event and patients are censored at death or at the date of last follow-up for patients alive and free of these events. Resection is considered R0 if the distance between the inked margin and tumor cells is ≥1 mm [

Radiologic response is defined according to RECIST criteria version 1.1 comparing pre-randomization and restaging imaging after 4 and 8 cycles of FOLFIRINOX (arm A) or after chemoradiotherapy (arm B). These time points are also used to assess tumor marker response. Pathologic response is defined using the modified 3-tier histologic tumor regression grading (HTRG) scheme [
