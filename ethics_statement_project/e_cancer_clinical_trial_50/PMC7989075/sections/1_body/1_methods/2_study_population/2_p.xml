Furthermore, patients are ineligible in case of previous malignancy, unless no evidence of disease and diagnosed more than 3 years before diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, or with a life expectancy of more than 5 years from date of inclusion. A past medical history of non-melanoma skin cancer, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET) &lt; 2 cm, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) &lt; 2 cm are not exclusion criteria.
