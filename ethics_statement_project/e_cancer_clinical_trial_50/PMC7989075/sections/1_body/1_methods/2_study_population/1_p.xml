<p id="Par37">Patients are eligible if they have histologically or cytologically confirmed resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer, without distant metastases. Resectability is assessed by a multiphase computed tomography (CT) scan within 4 weeks before randomization. A tumor without arterial (common hepatic artery, superior mesenteric artery, or celiac trunk) involvement and with venous (portal vein and/or superior mesenteric vein) involvement ≤90° is considered resectable; a tumor with arterial involvement ≤90° and/or venous involvement &gt; 90° and ≤ 270° without occlusion is considered borderline resectable. Other inclusion criteria are a World Health Organization (WHO) performance status of 0 or 1, ability to undergo surgery, chemoradiotherapy, and chemotherapy, age ≥ 18 years, adequate bone marrow function (i.e. hemoglobin ≥6 mmol/l; leucocytes ≥3.0 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/l; platelet count ≥100 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/l), adequate renal function (e-GFR ≥ 50 ml/min), and written informed consent.
