<p id="Par53">Based on the available evidence, we believe that neoadjuvant therapy is the best approach for the majority of patients with both resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. This paradigm shift was confirmed by a recently published study by Cloyd and colleagues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This meta-analysis of six RCTs comparing neoadjuvant treatment to upfront surgery for resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer patients showed that neoadjuvant treatment significantly improved OS by intention-to-treat compared with upfront surgery (HR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.61–0.86). The pooled HR remained in favor of neoadjuvant treatment in all subgroup analyses, thus independent on anatomic classification (resectable: HR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.59–0.91; borderline resectable: HR 0.51, 95% CI: 0.28–0.93) or neoadjuvant treatment type (chemoradiotherapy: HR 0.77, 95% CI: 0.61–0.98; chemotherapy alone: HR 0.68, 95% CI: 0.54–0.87) In addition, neoadjuvant treatment increased the likelihood of an R0 resection (RR 1.51, 95% CI: 1.18–1.93).
