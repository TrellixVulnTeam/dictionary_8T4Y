<p id="Par54">Since the design of the PREOPANC-2 trial, two RCTs showed superiority of gemcitabine combined with capecitabine (ESPAC-4 trial) and modified (m) FOLFIRINOX (PRODIGE 24/CCTG PA.6 trial) when compared to gemcitabine monotherapy in the adjuvant setting [

Based on these studies, both mFOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine with capecitabine have become preferred regimens in the adjuvant setting for patients with adequate performance status. It remains unclear what the best adjuvant regimen is after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and resection.
