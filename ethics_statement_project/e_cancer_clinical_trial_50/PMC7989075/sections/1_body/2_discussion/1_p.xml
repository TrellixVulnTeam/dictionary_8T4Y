<p id="Par52">Herein, we describe the protocol of the PREOPANC-2 trial, a multicenter randomized phase III trial conducted by the Dutch Pancreatic Cancer Group in the Netherlands, which was designed to compare the efficacy of two neoadjuvant treatment strategies for patients with resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. This study builds upon the results of the previously conducted PREOPANC-1 trial [
