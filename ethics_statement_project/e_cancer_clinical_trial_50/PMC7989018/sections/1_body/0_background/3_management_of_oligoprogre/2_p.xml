<p id="Par34">Management of OPD can be challenging; however, different treatment approaches are emerging, including (1) switching systemic therapy; (2) maintaining the same line of systemic therapy if there is low burden disease progression; (3) using local ablative radiotherapy while maintaining the same systemic therapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Lately, there has been a growing interest in the use of ablative radiotherapy in the management of OPD. Indeed, several retrospective studies of patients with EGFR and or ALK mutation non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with local ablative therapy and continued treatment with targeted therapy resulted in improved progression-free survival [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Similarly, a prospective study of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy in combination with erlotinib in patients with advanced NSCLC resulted in median progression-free and overall survival of 14.7 and 20.4 months, respectively [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] reported that 61% of the patients identified with apparent OPD would have been suitable for ablative radiotherapy, to our knowledge, there is a paucity of data about ablative radiotherapy in oligoprogressive breast cancer.
