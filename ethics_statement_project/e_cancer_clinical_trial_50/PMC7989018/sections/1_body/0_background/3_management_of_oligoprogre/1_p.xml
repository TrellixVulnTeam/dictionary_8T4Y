<p id="Par33">Oligoprogressive disease (OPD) is a new term that has emerged recently to describe a state in which a tumour progresses at few sites (usually 1–5 sites) while other sites remain stable or continue to respond to systemic therapy [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and Kelly et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] systematically characterised the pattern of disease progression for patients with ER-positive advanced breast cancer receiving endocrine therapy. This study identified a subset of breast cancer patients who exhibit OPD with approximately 31% of patients showing progression (while on endocrine therapy) at &lt; 4 sites. This situation frequently occurs in clinical practice with the extensive use of targeted therapy that may potentiate the evolution of drug-resistant subclones resulting in widespread resistance [
