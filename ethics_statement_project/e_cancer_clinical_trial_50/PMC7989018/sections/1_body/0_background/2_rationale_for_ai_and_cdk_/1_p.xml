<p id="Par32">The elucidation of endocrine resistance mechanisms has made it possible to identify new therapeutic targets that can be suppressed by agents such as cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors [

The current preferred first line therapy for most patients with ER-positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer is therefore endocrine therapy combined with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor. Several randomised controlled trials (MONALEESA-2, MONALEESA-7, PALOMA-2 and MONARCH-3) have shown an improvement in progression-free survival using this treatment combination [
