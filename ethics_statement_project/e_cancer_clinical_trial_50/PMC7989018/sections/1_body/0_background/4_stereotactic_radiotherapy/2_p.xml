<p id="Par37">SRT is an effective, low toxicity option for ablative management of oligo-metastases with local control &gt; 90% and very rare grade 3 toxicities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The NRG-BR001 is a phase I study of 42 patients with oligo-metastases, 13 of whom had breast primary, showed that SABR to 4 metastases or 2 nearby metastases is a safe treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It is therefore rational to use SRT to ablate the progressing disease sites in oligoprogressive cancer in an attempt to eliminate the resistant sub-clones and to enable the continued efficacy of the systemic therapy –an AI combined with CDK 4/6 inhibitor in the present study.
