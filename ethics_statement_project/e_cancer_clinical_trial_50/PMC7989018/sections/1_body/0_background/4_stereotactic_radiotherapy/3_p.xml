<p id="Par38">The purpose of this study is to determine if SRT to five or fewer OPD sites extends the time patients with advanced ER positive HER2 negative breast cancer are treated with an AI combined with CDK 4/6 inhibitor, i.e. extends the time these patients are treated with the current line systemic therapy. Furthermore, this study will evaluate the impact of this treatment regimen on progression free and overall survival. The clinical implications of this study are particularly important given the potential for patients treated with SRT to maintain their quality of life by delaying the use of more toxic treatment for small volume progressive disease.</p>
