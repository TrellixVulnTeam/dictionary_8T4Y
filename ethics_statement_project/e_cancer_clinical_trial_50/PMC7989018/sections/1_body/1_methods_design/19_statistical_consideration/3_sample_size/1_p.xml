<p id="Par131">We consider SRT to not provide a clinically meaningful benefit in this setting if ≥75% of patients require a change in systemic therapy within 6 months of enrolment (i.e. &lt; 25% of patients remain on AI + CDK 4/6 inhibitor 6 months after SRT). The percentage of patients requiring a change to therapy at 6 months is expected to be 50%. With those assumptions, 32 patients will allow the rejection of the null hypothesis of 25% if the true rate is 50% with &gt; 80% power and 2.5% one sided alpha assuming up to 3 patients may not be evaluable (censored) for the primary endpoint.</p>
