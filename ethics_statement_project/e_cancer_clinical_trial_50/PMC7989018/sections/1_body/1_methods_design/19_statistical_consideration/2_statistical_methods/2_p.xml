<p id="Par129">Time to change in systemic therapy, PFS and OS curves will be described using Kaplan-Meier methods. The curves will be presented with 95% confidence intervals. Estimates at key time points (e.g. 6 and 12â€‰months) and median times will also be provided with respective 95% confidence interval. An event history plot will also be provided. A cut-off date for follow-up will be determined at the time of analysis. The cut-off date will be chosen to enable data on follow-up to that date to be collected, where possible, on all living patients. All events occurring after this date will be ignored in the analysis in order to minimise reporting bias.</p>
