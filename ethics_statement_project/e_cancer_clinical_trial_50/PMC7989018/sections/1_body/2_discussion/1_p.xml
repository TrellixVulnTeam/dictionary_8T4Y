<p id="Par144">Nearly one third of patients with ER-positive advanced breast cancer will develop OPD while on endocrine therapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, OPD is expected to be encountered more frequently in the clinic with the increased use of endocrine therapy combined with CDK 4/6 inhibitor that could trigger resistance and disease progression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, SRT may be a promising treatment modality to overcome resistant breast cancer without significant toxicity.
