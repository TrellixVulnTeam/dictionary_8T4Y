<p>Eligible patients will be selected out of a local database of TNBC patients and will be recruited during the first year following the end of RT. The data collected before inclusion, such as TILs evaluation at baseline and in the surgical specimen, as well as blood test results at different times (baseline, before surgery, before the start of RT, and 6 months after the end of RT) will also be analyzed. After inclusion in the PERCEPTION trial, patients will undergo 2 interventions. A blood test will be performed 12 months after the end of RT and another blood test will be performed at the time of the first metastatic recurrence, if applicable. WBC, ANC, ALC, APC, NLR, PLR, and ctDNA will be measured from these blood tests. The overall follow-up is 5 years (see Fig.
