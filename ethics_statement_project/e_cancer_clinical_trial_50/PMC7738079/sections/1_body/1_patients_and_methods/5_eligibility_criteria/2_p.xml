<p>The participants should meet the inclusion criteria in order to be enrolled in the study (see Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Only adult (over 18 years of age) female patients diagnosed for the first time with non-metastatic TNBC will be recruited. The eligible patients must be treated with chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy (RT). The lack of tumor sample from biopsy, necessary for the evaluation of TILs and the lack of blood test results at diagnosis will render the inclusion impossible.
