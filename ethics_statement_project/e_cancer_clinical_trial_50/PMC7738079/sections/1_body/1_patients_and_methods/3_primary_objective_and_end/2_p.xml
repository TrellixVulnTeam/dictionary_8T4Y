<p>The primary objective of the PERCEPTION study is to evaluate the correlation between the amount of TILs found in the biopsy, measured semi-quantitatively as the percentage of tumor stromal area occupied by lymphocytes

 </sup> and the NLR derived from the absolute blood counts of neutrophils and lymphocytes in TNBC patients, at the time of diagnosis. The primary endpoints are the value of NLR and the amount of TILs at diagnosis (before any treatment). NLR is defined as the ratio of the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) over the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) (NLR = ANC/ALC).
