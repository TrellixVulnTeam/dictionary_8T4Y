  <p>The relationship between the other blood counts and the TILs at different times will be assessed through a correlation analysis as for the main objective.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>The relationship between the absolute blood counts and the derived ratios (NLR, PLR), and the response to NACT will be evaluated by analyses of variance (or Kruskalâ€“Wallis tests) and logistic regressions. A subgroup analysis will be performed based on the length of the period between the last cycle of NACT and surgery. A mixed model will also be considered to account for repeated measures and the time lag between the end of NACT and surgery.</p>

  <p>The relationship between the presence of ctDNA after the end of treatment and the relapse of TNBC will be analyzed by Fisher's exact test. Patients treated with NACT and first-line surgery will be analyzed separately.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>The elements of blood will be assessed as early markers of TNBC relapse using logistic regressions, possibly penalized (the LASSO method). Patients treated with NACT and first-line surgery will be analyzed separately.</p>
