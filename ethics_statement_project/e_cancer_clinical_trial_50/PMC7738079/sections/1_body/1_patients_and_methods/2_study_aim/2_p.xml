<p>The aim of this study is to evaluate the correlation between the absolute counts of blood neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets, as well as the NLR and PLR, and the amount of TILs assessed on hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained breast tumor tissue sampled before treatment for women with TNBC. Evaluation of this correlation might provide important information whether peripheral blood counts and their ratios could replace TILs in the prediction of TNBC treatment response and metastatic recurrence. Another aim of this study is to assess ctDNA as a biomarker of metastatic cancer recurrence.</p>
