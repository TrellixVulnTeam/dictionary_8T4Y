<p>Given the scarcity of data in the literature concerning the correlation between TILs and NLR, our goal is to recruit as many patients as possible. A sample size of 90 patients would allow us to show an average effect size of 0.3 (with a 0.8 power and a 0.05 alpha risk). According to preliminary studies (not published), the variables present enough variability to allow for the detection of a correlation.</p>
