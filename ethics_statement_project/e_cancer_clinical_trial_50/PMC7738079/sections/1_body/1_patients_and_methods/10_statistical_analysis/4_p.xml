<p>Normality of continuous variables will be investigated and we will perform a description of the dependencies of the pairs of variables, where relevant. For hypothesis testing, alpha risk will be set at the conventional 5%, 
 <italic>P</italic>-value corrections will be made for multiple comparisons, and effect sizes will be systematically specified. If relevant, post-hoc tests and comparisons in subgroups will also be performed for exploratory purposes and with adjustment for multiple testings.
