<p>Besides the full blood count, several studies have shown a correlation between the presence of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood and treatment response or even metastatic recurrence.

 </sup> Despite the insufficient data in TNBC, studies have shown that ctDNA is a reliable marker in predicting cancer recurrence, due to its high sensitivity and specificity.

 </sup> Moreover, this circulating biomarker can be obtained and quantified from a simple blood test. Therefore, evaluation of ctDNA as a predictor of metastatic relapse in TNBC is of great interest and it could provide additional information to that of TILs and/or the circulating blood cell counts.
