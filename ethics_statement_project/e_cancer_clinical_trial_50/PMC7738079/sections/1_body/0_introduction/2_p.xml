<p>Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents 10% to 20% of all breast cancers. Treatment strategies for this type of breast cancer are limited, due to the lack of hormone receptor expression (oestrogen receptors and progesterone receptors) and the absence of amplification for the gene coding for the Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) protein, in tumor cells.

 </sup> As a result, patients diagnosed with TNBC cannot benefit from endocrine therapy or anti-HER2 therapy. Therefore, TNBC has an unfavorable prognosis with a high rate of metastatic recurrence during the first 5 years after treatment.

 </sup> However, not all TNBC patients develop metastatic recurrence and it is therefore crucial to identify biomarkers that would allow determining which patients will eventually relapse.
