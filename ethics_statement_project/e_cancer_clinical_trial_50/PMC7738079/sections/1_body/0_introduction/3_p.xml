<p>Several studies have demonstrated that higher amounts of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the biopsy before treatment are associated with higher rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT).

 </sup> Other studies have shown a correlation between the presence of high TIL quantity in the surgical specimen after NACT and a better relapse-free survival, as well as a significantly reduced death rate, in patients suffering from TNBC.

 </sup> For instance, Dieci et al have found that the 5-year overall survival rate for patients with high quantities of TILs in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy setting was 91% and significantly higher than that of patients with low quantities of TILs whose 5-year overall survival rate was 55%.
