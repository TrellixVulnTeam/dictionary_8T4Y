<p>In conclusion, the PERCEPTION trial will give us important information about the correlation between NLR and TILs before treatment in TNBC patients and at other time periods. It will allow us to determine if we can further explore the values of blood cells as predictive markers in TNBC, and propose further studies, assessing new biomarkers that could be of great value in the treatment of TNBC.</p>
