<p>The PERCEPTION clinical trial is designed to verify whether a peripheral blood count or a ratio of peripheral blood counts can provide similar prognostic information as TILs. However, this clinical trial has certain drawbacks. First of all, since it is conducted at a single site, the sample size will be relatively limited. Furthermore, this study will only assess the full blood count and ctDNA as predictors of relapse. Studying other elements, such as circulating proteins would be of great interest in the prediction of TNBC relapse.</p>
