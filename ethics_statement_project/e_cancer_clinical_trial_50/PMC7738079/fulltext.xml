Due to its characteristics, treatment strategies are limited and metastatic recurrences are common in the first 5 years after treatment. However, not all patients affected by this disease develop metastases. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes have shown to be reliable predictive biomarkers of treatment response and metastatic recurrences. However, we need to develop simpler and faster ways to predict response to cytotoxic treatment and the possibility of eventual cancer relapse by identifying new biomarkers. Recently, new studies are emerging, suggesting a predictive role of circulating blood cells in different types of cancer. In this study, we will assess the correlation between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and different elements of the blood count in patients diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods:</title><p>The main objective of this study is to evaluate the correlation between the peripheral neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and the amount of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, assessed in triple negative breast cancer patients at diagnosis. Secondary objectives include evaluation of the correlation between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes at diagnosis and the baseline absolute neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet counts, as well as the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio. The triple negative breast cancer patients will be enrolled in the PERCEPTION trial during the first year after the treatment completion. Two supplementary blood tests, at 12 months after the end of treatment and at the time of the first metastatic recurrence, will be performed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion:</title><p>The discovery of new prognostic and predictive biomarkers is crucial for triple negative breast cancer.

Treatment strategies for this type of breast cancer are limited, due to the lack of hormone receptor expression (oestrogen receptors and progesterone receptors) and the absence of amplification for the gene coding for the Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) protein, in tumor cells.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> As a result, patients diagnosed with TNBC cannot benefit from endocrine therapy or anti-HER2 therapy. Therefore, TNBC has an unfavorable prognosis with a high rate of metastatic recurrence during the first 5 years after treatment.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> However, not all TNBC patients develop metastatic recurrence and it is therefore crucial to identify biomarkers that would allow determining which patients will eventually relapse.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated that higher amounts of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the biopsy before treatment are associated with higher rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT).<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Other studies have shown a correlation between the presence of high TIL quantity in the surgical specimen after NACT and a better relapse-free survival, as well as a significantly reduced death rate, in patients suffering from TNBC.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> For instance, Dieci et al have found that the 5-year overall survival rate for patients with high quantities of TILs in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy setting was 91% and significantly higher than that of patients with low quantities of TILs whose 5-year overall survival rate was 55%.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup></p><p>The assessment of TIL quantity in a cancer tissue specimen is a semi-quantitative method, which is still not in routine use due to the need for a highly skilled pathologist to perform it, and, also, due to certain level of the inherent error risk. Therefore, reliable quantitative biomarkers that are easy to measure and that could provide additional information to that of TILs or even replace them in predicting treatment response and disease relapse are still lacking.</p><p>Various blood cell counts and the ratios between them, such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) could be used as predictive biomarkers in several types of cancer, including breast cancer.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> The research conducted by Lee et al in 2019 suggests that low NLR at baseline is associated with a better overall survival in TNBC patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup></p><p>Besides the full blood count, several studies have shown a correlation between the presence of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood and treatment response or even metastatic recurrence.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Despite the insufficient data in TNBC, studies have shown that ctDNA is a reliable marker in predicting cancer recurrence, due to its high sensitivity and specificity.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Moreover, this circulating biomarker can be obtained and quantified from a simple blood test. Therefore, evaluation of ctDNA as a predictor of metastatic relapse in TNBC is of great interest and it could provide additional information to that of TILs and/or the circulating blood cell counts.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study aim</title><p>The aim of this study is to evaluate the correlation between the absolute counts of blood neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets, as well as the NLR and PLR, and the amount of TILs assessed on hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E)-stained breast tumor tissue sampled before treatment for women with TNBC. Evaluation of this correlation might provide important information whether peripheral blood counts and their ratios could replace TILs in the prediction of TNBC treatment response and metastatic recurrence. Another aim of this study is to assess ctDNA as a biomarker of metastatic cancer recurrence.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Primary objective and endpoints</title><p>The primary objective of the PERCEPTION study is to evaluate the correlation between the amount of TILs found in the biopsy, measured semi-quantitatively as the percentage of tumor stromal area occupied by lymphocytes<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> and the NLR derived from the absolute blood counts of neutrophils and lymphocytes in TNBC patients, at the time of diagnosis.

Depending on their nature, they will be the subject of a new review by the French ethical research committee and/or an authorization from the competent authority.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Discussion</title><p>Identifying new biomarkers that would allow for a quick, inexpensive, and reliable prediction of treatment response and metastatic recurrence of TNBC patients is still an important unsatisfied medical need. Such biomarkers would allow oncologists to propose alternative treatment and enrolment into clinical trials to the TNBC patients carrying a high risk of resistance to the classical NACT or/and a high risk of metastatic recurrence.</p><p>The PERCEPTION clinical trial is designed to verify whether a peripheral blood count or a ratio of peripheral blood counts can provide similar prognostic information as TILs. However, this clinical trial has certain drawbacks. First of all, since it is conducted at a single site, the sample size will be relatively limited. Furthermore, this study will only assess the full blood count and ctDNA as predictors of relapse. Studying other elements, such as circulating proteins would be of great interest in the prediction of TNBC relapse.</p><p>In conclusion, the PERCEPTION trial will give us important information about the correlation between NLR and TILs before treatment in TNBC patients and at other time periods. It will allow us to determine if we can further explore the values of blood cells as predictive markers in TNBC, and propose further studies, assessing new biomarkers that could be of great value in the treatment of TNBC.</p></sec><sec><label>6</label><title>Trial status</title><p>As of this day 18 patients have been recruited in the PERCEPTION trial. Recruitment began on 4th of December 2019 and is ongoing, according to version 14 of the protocol of 9th October 2019. Recruitment is expected to be completed in October 2022.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p>NRR and XD conceived the study and contributed equally to this trial.
