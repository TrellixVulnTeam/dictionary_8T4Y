<p>The annual incident rates of new nodules (ELCAP, I-ELCAP, PLuSS, and Mayo trials) are reported between 3.4 and 13%. These new nodules are logically fast-growing and the data we have available show that the probability of malignancy in such a newly emerging nodule is 1.6% to 7.5%. Therefore, it may be necessary to choose a lower volume limit for these new nodules than for the first round of screening.

 </sup> The models that aim to distinguish between malignant and benign nodules include the model of McWilliams and the American College of Radiology model, which in 2014 published its Lung-RADS assessment criteria, which were updated in 2019 (Lung-RADS 1.1).

 </sup> The Lung-RADS model is the most cited as it is used in virtually all U.S. screening centers. It includes 5 categories that determine the type of lesion and its subsequent management based on the type of the lesion, its size, and behavior.
