<p>The best predictor of malignancy of a solid nodule is its size and growth rate.

 </sup> From a mean diameter of 6 mm it starts to increase steadily.
 <sup>[
  <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]
 </sup> The prevalence of malignancy in nodule &lt;5 mm is extremely low, about half a percent.

 </sup> In the NELSON trial, the risk of malignancy in subjects with nodules &lt;100 mm
 <sup>3</sup> was similar to those without nodules.

 </sup> Based on these data, the lower size threshold for nodules that require follow up was increased to 6 mm or 100 mm
