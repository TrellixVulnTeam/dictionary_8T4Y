<p>The interpretation of CT findings is based on the probability that a lesion harbors malignity and how fast it can develop beyond the localized stage. Several academic groups including the Fleischner society, the British thoracic society, the American College of Chest Physicians have proposed guidelines on the management of pulmonary nodules. They derive the risk and the need for further management from the imaging features of the nodule (size or volume, spiculation, upper lobe location, perifissural location), the lungs (emphysema), and the pretest probability of malignancy (age, family history of malignancy, obstruction).
