 </sup> The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual screening up to 80 years of age, while the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) end coverage at the age of 77, corresponding to the oldest age at the time of the final annual screen in the NLST. The optimal age span for screening was set to 55 to 74 years to precede the diagnosis of advanced lung cancer and to take into account a shorter life expectancy in the Czech Republic. The male gender carries a higher risk of lung cancer by a factor of 1.5 to 2.

 </sup> This fact is related to a smaller proportion of women, who are heavy smokers and can therefore be equalized by the pack-years inclusion criterion.
