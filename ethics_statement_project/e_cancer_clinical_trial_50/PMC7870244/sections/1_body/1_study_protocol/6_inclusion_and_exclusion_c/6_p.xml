<p>Patients who are not amenable to curative treatment due to their poor performance status are unlikely to benefit from the early detection of lung cancer. The performance of the patients can be assessed by their ability to undergo physical exertion such as climbing the stairs. In the DLCST trial, the threshold was the ability to climb 36 steps without pause.
