<p>In comparison with the Nelson study, where 2.1% scans were positive and 0.9% were cancers detected in the first round, we define a study population at greater risk and expect that the number of detected cancers would be greater. In the Nelson study 58.6% of cancers were detected at stage I compared to 13.5% in the control group. According to the Czech cancer registry, only 10.5% of lung cancers are detected in stage I.

 </sup> To compare these outcomes, the study would require 15 patients with detected cancer, about 1500 screened patients to achieve a power of 80% at a 0.05 significance level. For an expected adherence of 90% and the optimization of input values, we estimate the sample size at 2500 participants. This study is designed as observational, therefore it has no control arm and it has no ambition to assess the effect of lung screening on mortality such as in the NELSON trial with a sample size calculated between 17,300 and 27,900 participants.
