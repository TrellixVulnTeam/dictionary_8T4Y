<p>The selection of the optimal screening interval, which can be obtained by processing the NELSON study data, is important as well. It appears that the extension of the screening interval (in the NELSON trial it was 1 year, 2 years, and 2.5 years) brings a stationary incidence of diagnosed tumors to a screening round (0.8%), but worsening of the average stage of newly diagnosed tumors in the last round of screening (i.e., 2.5 years).

 </sup> Thus, the 2.5-year interval was too long. The screening interval was set at 12 months.
