<p>The proposed management protocol uses the recursive definition of nodules (with regard to their growth). It is based on the recommendations of the American College of Radiology (ACR), The Fleischner society guidelines, and results of the NELSON trial.

 </sup> The primary assessment of risk (that a lesion harbors malignity) is based on volumetry and doubling time (Tables 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). For solid nodules, the volume threshold is 100 mm
 <sup>3</sup> (70 mm
 <sup>3</sup> for new nodules), the VDT threshold is 600 days. Subsolid nodules are rare (0.7%) and the risk of malignancy or premalignancy is low (6%) unless a new solid component appears.

 </sup> The data on the management of sub-solid nodules are scarce which is reflected in the diversity of recommendations across different guidelines.

 </sup> The update of the Lung-RADS model in 2019 increased the lower boundary for purely ground-glass nodules that require further management to 30 mm.
