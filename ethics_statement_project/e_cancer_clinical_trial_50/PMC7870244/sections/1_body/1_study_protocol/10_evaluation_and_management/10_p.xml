<p>A positive screening test is defined as a high risk finding or intermediate risk finding where verification (PET/CT, tissue sampling, contrast-enhanced CT) was requested. An indeterminate test is defined as low and intermediate risk finding, further managed by LDCT. A negative test (benign appearance or behavior) does not mean that an individual does not have lung cancer.</p>
