<p>In the United States, where lung cancer screening is an established and recognized tool, smoking prevalence is only 15 percent. In the Czech Republic where every fourth adult and about 12% of primary school pupils are active smokers, there is no screening for lung cancer yet. Because of the unsatisfactory results of anti-smoking intervention programs and the fact that even more lung tumors are becoming diagnosed in former (non-active) smokers, secondary prevention by early detection of lung cancer by screening in a selected population is proposed.</p>
