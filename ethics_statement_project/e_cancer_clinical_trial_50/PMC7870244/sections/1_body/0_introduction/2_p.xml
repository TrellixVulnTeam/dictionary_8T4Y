 </sup> With more than half of the cases diagnosed in stage IV, the relative 5-year survival is only 10% making it the most common cause of death among oncological diagnoses. Cigarette smoking is a well-documented cause of lung cancer and about 90% of lung cancers are directly caused by smoking. The relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked per day, the depth of inhalation, the age of the smoker, and the development of lung cancer have been documented.
