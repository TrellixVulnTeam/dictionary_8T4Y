A barbed absorbable suture was applied to approximate the remained arcus tendinous and distal triangular plate anterior to the urethra, which included the residual endopelvic fascia rhabdosphincter, puboprostatic ligaments and dorsal venous complex to the neck of the bladder. In Group B, the urethral was reconstructed in the second step in Group A only.
