<p id="Par46">The aim of this study is to compare the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy with nab-paclitaxel plus S-1 versus oxaliplatin plus capecitabine for gastric cancer after D2 gastrectomy, so as to explore which treatment is better. Although this is not the first phase III trial comparing postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy worldwide, it has some advantages. XELOX regimen improves patient outcomes after surgery and is the preferred adjuvant chemotherapy after curative resection of stage III gastric cancer recommended by the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) guidelines [

S-1 monotherapy has proven to be effective and low-toxic, and is preferred in some Asian countries as standard component of resectable gastric cancer therapy [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therefore, we choose XELOX as the control group and hypothesized that the combination of nab-paclitaxel and S-1 could improve the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy compare with XELOX and has better safety.
