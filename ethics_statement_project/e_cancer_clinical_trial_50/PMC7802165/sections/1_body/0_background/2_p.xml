<p id="Par13">Surgical resection is the only possible cure for patients with gastric cancer, and the prognosis of gastric cancer is closely related to the time between diagnosis and treatment. Most early gastric cancers can be treated under endoscopy, and the 5-year survival rate is more than 90%, while the 5-year survival rate of advanced gastric cancer is still less than 30% even after surgery-based comprehensive treatments [

In a phase III trial, 1059 patients were randomized to receive S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy or surgery alone, and the results showed that S-1 as adjuvant chemotherapy was better than surgery alone in patients with stage II/III gastric cancer after D2 lymph node dissection; the 3-year RFS rate was 72.2% in the S-1 treatment group and 59.6% in the surgery alone group [
