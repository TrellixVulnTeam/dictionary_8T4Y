<p id="Par14">Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of adjuvant chemotherapy based on S-1 in D2 radical surgery for postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage II-III gastric cancer, including S-1 plus cisplatin or S-1 plus oxaliplatin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A clinical trial of an AS regimen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] in patients with advanced gastric cancer showed an ORR of 58.9%, an mPFS of 9.6 months, and an mOS of 14.6 months among 72 patients. In terms of safety, 22 patients (30.1%) developed grade 3/4 toxicity, mainly including neutropenia (12.3%), anemia (5.5%), diarrhea (6.8%), vomiting (2.7%), and peripheral neuropathy (1.4%); no fatal adverse event occurred, indicating that the AS regimen has good efficacy and controllable safety, but whether it is more effective than standard adjuvant XELOX in adjuvant chemotherapy has not been confirmed. This multicenter phase III study evaluates the safety and efficacy of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) combined with S-1 in patients with stage III gastric cancer after D2 radical resection.
