<p id="Par44">In this trial, the patients will be hierarchically grouped by a network multicenter central stochastic system. The subjects will be randomized by the system after screening. This study uses DFS as the main evaluation index. According to the CLASSIC study, the 3-year DFS rates of patients with IIIA and IIIB gastric adenocarcinoma who received XELOX regimen are 66 and 61%, respectively [

According to the ACTS-GC trial, the 3-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate of patients with stage III gastric cancer who received S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy (sixth edition of International Union Against Cancer (UICC) TNM classification) is 69.1% in stage IIIA and 44.8% in stage IIIB [

Considering type I error (bilateral) α=0.05 and the test efficacy β=0.8, hazard ratio (HR) of 0.66, and estimated drop-out rate of 10%, about 616 patients will be randomly enrolled in the clinical study, with a total study period of about 60 months.
