<p id="Par41">This multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled phase III clinical study (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) evaluates the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel combined with S-1 (AS) vs. oxaliplatin combined with capecitabine (XELOX) in patients with stage III gastric cancer who underwent D2 radical surgery and achieved R0 resection. In the XELOX group, capecitabine (1000 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup>) will be administered orally twice daily on days 1–14, with oxaliplatin given i.v. at 130 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> on day 1 of each 3-week cycle for eight cycles. In the AS group: S-1 (80–120 mg) (&lt; 1.25 m
 <sup>2</sup>, 40 mg; 1.25 to &lt; 1.5 m
 <sup>2</sup>, 50 mg; and &gt; 1.5 m
 <sup>2</sup>, 60 mg) will be was administered orally twice daily on days 1–14, with paclitaxel (albumin-binding) given i.v. at 120 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> on days 1 and 8 of each 3-week cycle for eight cycles.
