<p id="Par32">The limitation of the present study is that this randomized study is not aimed at evaluating statistical comparison of the difference in prognoses between the two arms. Rather, this study is aimed at providing basic information for improving the performance evaluation of a future randomized phase III study. The LOGIK1702 study will give us new information on the optimal chemotherapy regimen for completely resected NSCLC.</p>
