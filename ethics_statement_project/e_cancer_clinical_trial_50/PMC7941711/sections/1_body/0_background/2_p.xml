<p id="Par18">A recent study of the 5-year survival in a randomized phase III study of cisplatin with pemetrexed versus cisplatin with vinorelbine for completely resected stage II-IIIA non-squamous NSCLC (the JIPANG study) was reported (ASCO 2019 8501). The JIPANG study failed to show the superiority of pemetrexed plus cisplatin over vinorelbine plus cisplatin and the cost of pemetrexed is high. However, the regimen will be considered as an option for adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II-IIIA non-squamous NSCLC since the effect is comparable and the patients treated with cisplatin and pemetrexed had a higher completion rate with low adverse reactions compared to the patients treated with cisplatin and vinorelbine. Another recent approach is the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) for postoperative patients. Several clinical trials of ICI with/without chemotherapy are currently underway in adjuvant setting [
