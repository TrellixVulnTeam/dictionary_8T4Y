<p id="Par20">Feasibility studies of S-1 based adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage IB to IIIA NSCLC have also been conducted [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] . The results indicate that the completion rates of planned one-year treatment courses were comparable to platinum doublet (50–72%) and the grade 3 adverse reactions were very low (4–20%) with no grade 4 adverse reactions. The grade 3/4 neutropenia was extremely low (0–6.7%), compared to the meta-analysis of cisplatin with vinorelbine adjuvant chemotherapy of 80% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The 5-year overall and relapse free survival rates of the S-1 treated postoperative patients with stage IB-IIIA NSCLC were 72.5 and 67.5%, which are obviously better than those of previously reported studies including platinum doublet based adjuvant chemotherapies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The randomized phase II study of adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 and cisplatin with S-1 revealed that the survival rates of both groups overlap in patients with completely resected stage II–IIIA NSCLC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], indicating that S-1 monotherapy has the potential for replacing the standard regimen of platinum doublet by virtue of its efficacy and safety.
