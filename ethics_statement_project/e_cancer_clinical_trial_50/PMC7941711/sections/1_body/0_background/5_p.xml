<p id="Par21">The low incidence of adverse reaction directly correlates with the quality of life of the treated patients. Because of mild adverse reactions, S-1 can be administrated for outpatients without hospitalization and treated patients can continue daily life and working, which will maintain the social productivity of the treated individuals. The evaluation of quality of life (QOL) and work productivity of postoperative patients shows the advantage of S-1 chemotherapy versus standard platinum doublet adjuvant chemotherapy. Taken together, these findings have enabled us to design the current phase II study to confirm the beneficial effects of S-1 in adjuvant chemotherapy. In this article, we describe the protocol (version 2; January 14, 2020) for this study. The results of this study are expected to provide basic information for raising the precision of performance for a randomized phase III study.</p>
