<p id="Par17">Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In order to prevent lung cancer recurrence, adjuvant chemotherapy in post-operative patients with stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been established as the standard treatment [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The standard regimen for adjuvant chemotherapy is intravenous administration of a platinum doublet [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the representative regimen of cisplatin (CDDP) with vinorelbine (VNR) causes grade three or four adverse reactions including severe leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation, nausea, vomiting, constipation, asthenia, injection site reaction, and prolonged peripheral neuropathy in more than 70% of patients. Renal dysfunction often occurs and sometimes remains lifelong. Given the severe adverse reactions to this standard adjuvant chemotherapy and the fact that there are few remnant malignant cells in the postoperative patients, milder treatment options have been considered.
