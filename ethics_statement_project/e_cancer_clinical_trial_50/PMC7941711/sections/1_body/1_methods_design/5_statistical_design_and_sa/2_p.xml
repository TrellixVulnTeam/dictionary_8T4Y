<p id="Par30">Relapse-free survival was defined as the time from the date of the start of treatment to the date of disease progression or death (whichever occurs first) or the date of last contact. Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of the start of treatment to the date of death or last contact. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the time-to-event functions of relapse-free survival and overall survival. The log-rank test will be conducted as a reference without setting the significance level.</p>
