<p id="Par22">The present study is a multicenter, phase II, randomized, open-labelled, parallel-group comparison study of the efficacy and safety of S-1 compared with cisplatin plus vinorelbine for adjuvant therapy in patients with NSCLC. The study design is summarized in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the experimental arm (1 year of S-1 administration) or control arm (four cycles of cisplatin with vinorelbine administration), stratified according to sex (female vs. male), age (&lt; 70 years vs. 70 years), pathologic stage (II vs. IIIA) and pathology (squamous cell carcinoma vs. non- squamous cell carcinoma). The primary endpoint is 2-year relapse-free survival (RFS). The secondary endpoints are 2-year overall survival (OS), rate of treatment completion, safety, work productivity and activity, and quality of adjusted life years (QALY). QALY is calculated by the time points of QOL converted from the questionnaire method using Euro QoL 5 dimensions (EQ-5D-5L) [
