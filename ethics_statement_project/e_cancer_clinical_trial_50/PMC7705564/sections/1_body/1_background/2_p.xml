<p>Surgical treatment can cause a sharp inflammatory response due to local tissue damage. The relationship between carcinogenesis and inflammation is empirically known.
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> For example, a relationship between chronic inflammation due to infection and carcinogenesis can be seen with the following conditions: hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatitis C virus, gastric cancer and 
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, and cervical cancer and human papilloma virus.
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Although the duration, cause and pathology of inflammation differ, these findings suggest that a common molecular mechanism may exist during the carcinogenesis process.
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> For example, various inflammatory cytokines, chemical mediators such as prostaglandins, and growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are involved when promoting growth, proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells.
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Surgical invasion causes the production and secretion of inflammatory cytokines, prostaglandins and VEGF, which are responsible for the regulation of various physiological functions during the wound healing process. Thus, surgical inflammation may contribute to early postoperative recurrence.
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In fact, a high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was reported to be associated with a poor prognosis in 255 patients with lung cancer.
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In tumor-bearing mice, Krall 
 <italic>et al</italic>
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> demonstrated that surgical invasion accelerates cellular proliferation and distant metastasis in patients with micrometastasis and that meloxicam suppresses these processes.
