<p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have various pharmacological actions, including anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions. While the role of NSAIDs in cancer prevention remains unclear due to inconsistent and contradicting findings,
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> several observational studies have shown that carcinogenesis seems to be suppressed in regular users of NSAIDs,
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and this association was reported in various cancer types,
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> including colon cancer with high cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression levels
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and lung cancer.
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Flurbiprofen axetil (Ropion) is the only intravenous non-steroidal analgesic in Japan and a prodrug of flurbiprofen that strongly inhibits prostaglandin biosynthesis. Although COX-2 selectivity of flurbiprofen axetil is not high as ketorolac which is widely used in Europe and the USA, it is an inexpensive analgesic and is widely used as an adjunct for general anaesthesia. A meta-analysis
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> showed that flurbiprofen axetil is useful and safe for postoperative analgesia, and some studies have reported that it suppresses postoperative elevations of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors in blood
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref> and that intraoperative use of it with steroids might suppress postoperative recurrence of lung cancer.
