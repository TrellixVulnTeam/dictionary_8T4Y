<p>It has been pointed out that anaesthesia, analgesia and perioperative management may affect the postoperative recurrence and long-term prognosis of patients with cancer.

 <italic>et al</italic> reported that anaesthetic management using NSAIDs was associated with the long-term prognosis of patients with breast cancer who received curative surgery. In a retrospective study of 319 patients with mastectomy with axillary dissection, the recurrence rate in the ketorolac (NSAIDs) group was decreased in comparison to the no ketorolac group (HR=0.37, p=0.019).
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In consideration of this finding, a randomised controlled trial is currently underway in Europe to determine whether the intraoperative administration of ketorolac contributes to postoperative recurrence in patients with breast cancer.
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> However, there have been no attempts to verify whether the perioperative administration of NSAIDs contributes to postoperative recurrence in patients with lung cancer. In this multicentre randomised phase II study, we investigate the effect of the perioperative administration of flurbiprofen axetil on postoperative recurrence in NSCLC.
