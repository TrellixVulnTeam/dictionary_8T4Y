<p>Analgesic methods other than the systemic administration of NSAIDs (suppositories, intravenous injections) should be selected based on clinical practice. For postoperative multimodal analgesia, acetaminophen alone or tramadol hydrochloride/acetaminophen combination products are used together with epidural anaesthesia, IVPCA or intercostal nerve block. In principle, NSAIDs are not used during hospitalisation; however, the systemic administration of acetaminophen preparations (suppositories, intravenous injections) and the use of NSAIDs patches to provide sufficient analgesia are acceptable.</p>
