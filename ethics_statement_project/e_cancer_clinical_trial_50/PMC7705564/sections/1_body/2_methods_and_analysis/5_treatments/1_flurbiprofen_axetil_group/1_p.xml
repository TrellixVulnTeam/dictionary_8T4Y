<p>Flurbiprofen axetil (50 mg) is slowly injected intravenously between the induction of general anaesthesia and surgical incision. The use of NSAIDs as oral analgesics is recommended postoperatively. Other analgesic methods, such as epidural anaesthesia, intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IVPCA) and intercostal nerve block, are selected based on the clinical practice of each anaesthesiologist. The repeated administration of flurbiprofen axetil injection is also allowed at least 6 hours apart as part of a multimodal approach to achieve postoperative pain relief until effective pain relief can be administered.</p>
