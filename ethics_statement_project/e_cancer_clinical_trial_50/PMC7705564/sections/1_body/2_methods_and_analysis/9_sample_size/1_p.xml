<p>In a retrospective cohort study,
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> including the institutions participating in this study, the 2-year RFS rate in patients with NSCLC with surgery was 0.75. The HR of ketorolac administration in patients with surgically treated breast and lung cancer was 0.16–0.37.
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 31</xref> In addition, the HR of flurbiprofen administration in patients with surgically treated lung cancer was 0.80.
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In this study, we assumed that the 2-year RFS rate in the no-NSAIDS group would be 0.75 and that the HR would be 0.60. When the registration period is 2 years, the follow-up period is 2 years, the one-sided α is set to 5% and the power is set to 80%, the required number of patients is 382. Considering deviations and loss to follow-up, the target number of patients was set to 420 (210 per group).
