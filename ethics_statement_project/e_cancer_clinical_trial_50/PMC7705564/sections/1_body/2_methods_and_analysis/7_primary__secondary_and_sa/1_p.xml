<p>The primary endpoint is recurrence-free survival (RFS), which is defined as the time from randomisation until recurrence or death due to any cause. Patients without an event were censored at the time of the final follow-up. The secondary endpoint is OS, which is defined as the time from randomisation until death due to any cause. Although OS (or the 5-year survival rate) has been used to evaluate the treatment effects of resectable NSCLC, it has recently been reported that RFS can be a surrogate endpoint for OS.
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> It was shown that recurrence in lung cancer peaked within 1 year after surgery and that over 60% of all recurrences occurred within 2 years after surgery.
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In a breast cancer study,
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> a suppressive effect of perioperative NSAIDs on recurrence was shown at up to 2 years after surgery; that is, it may not contribute to the suppression of recurrence after 2 years. Therefore, RFS was set as the primary endpoint.
