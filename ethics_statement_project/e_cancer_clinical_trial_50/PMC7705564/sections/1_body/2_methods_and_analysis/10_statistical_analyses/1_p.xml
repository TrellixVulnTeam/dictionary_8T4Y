<p>The primary analysis was to evaluate the treatment effect of flurbiprofen axetil on RFS. Survival curves for RFS will be compared between two groups by the stratified log-rank test with allocation factors (sex, clinical stage) other than institutions. The Kaplan-Meier method is used to estimate survival curves for RFS, median RFS and 2-year RFS. To estimate the HR as a treatment effect, a stratified Cox proportional hazard model will be established using the same factors as the log-rank test. The one-sided significance level is set to 5% for the log-rank test, and the two-sided confidence level for interval estimation is set to 5%.</p>
