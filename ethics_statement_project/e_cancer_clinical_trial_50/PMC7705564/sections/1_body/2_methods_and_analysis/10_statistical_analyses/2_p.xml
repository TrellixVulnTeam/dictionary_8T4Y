<p>The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will be defined as all patients randomly assigned to a treatment group with at least one efficacy assessment after randomisation, and the Per Protocol Set (PPS) will be defined as all patients in the FAS who do not have major protocol deviations. The Safety Analysis Set (SAS) will include all randomised patients with at least one safety assessment after randomisation. The FAS will be used for all efficacy analyses, and the PPS will be used for sensitivity analysis, while the SAS will be used for the safety analysis. Missing data will not be imputed and instead be excluded.</p>
