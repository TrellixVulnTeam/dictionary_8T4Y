<p>As the study drugs were administrated not only intravenously but also orally throughout the perioperative period, the blinding of the patients, surgeons and anesthesiologists was considered difficult due to the nature of the interventions, so we chose to conduct an open-label trial.

The statistician analysing the results will also be blinded to group allocation.</p>
