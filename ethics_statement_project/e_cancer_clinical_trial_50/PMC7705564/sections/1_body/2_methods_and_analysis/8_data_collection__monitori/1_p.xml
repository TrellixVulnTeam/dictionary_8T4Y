<p>For patient registration, randomisation and data collection, we used a web-based system established by the Internet Data and Information Center for Medical Research at the University Hospital Medical Information Network. The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee reviews the safety data and monitors protocol compliance and on-schedule study progress. Early termination of the trial can be considered if treatment-related death or serious adverse events occur.</p>
