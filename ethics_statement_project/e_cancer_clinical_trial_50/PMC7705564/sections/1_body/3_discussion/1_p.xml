<p>To date, no complete randomised controlled trials have assessed the potential effects of NSAIDs on postoperative recurrence in NSCLC. Surgery is the main treatment for early stage NSCLC. However, surgical procedures accompanied by tissue injury can induce acute inflammation by causing the production of cytokines, prostaglandins and VEGF, which promote neoplastic progression. Thus, surgery itself may play a fundamental role in cancer recurrence. It has been reported that anaesthetic technique and analgesic agents administered during surgery might influence cancer recurrence. Flurbiprofen axetil is a safe and inexpensive NSAID that is used perioperatively as a part of multimodal analgesia. Unlike most cytotoxic chemotherapies, this treatment can be safely used perioperatively to reduce postoperative recurrence. Results from this study will provide clinically valuable information.</p>
