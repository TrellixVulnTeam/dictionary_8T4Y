 </sup> assessed the caries prevention effect of fluoride varnish in irradiated HNC patients. They found that with the three-month interval fluoride varnish application, the caries incremental rate was found to be 1.6/month for 15 months. However, it was seen that the rate of caries progression was slower initially, till first 6 months, that is, 1.3/month. The caries incremental rate increased after 6 months to 1.7/month, indicating that the progression of radiation caries is a late effect of radiotherapy. These findings support that the efficacy of fluoride might be limited in long-term oral care protocols. However, no control group for comparison was an important weakness of previous study. Our research may be the first clinical trial to assess the efficacy of fluoride varnish.
