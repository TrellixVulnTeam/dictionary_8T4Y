<p>Although the preventive oral health effects of fluoride varnish were not evident in our study, we also examined whether the comprehensive oral care program may influence the EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35 score or not. According to our study, QoL-scores on all scales deteriorated during treatment, reaching the worst scores around end of radiotherapy and started to improve within 3 months later. Especially, swallowing, speech, and sexuality parameters of the EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35 module worsened at immediate after radiotherapy in both experimental and control group probably because of acute toxicities of treatment but recovered significantly over 6 months only in experimental group. Previous study showed that statistically significant and clinically relevant deteriorations were found on QLQ-H&amp;N35 dry mouth and sticky saliva scales.

 </sup> Another study found that a linear improvement over time was seen for social eating and social contacts and non-linear changes were seen for oral pain with improvement after treatment and deterioration afterwards and for senses with deterioration after treatment and improvement afterwards.

 </sup> Patients with oral or oropharynx cancer had more sexual problems compared to patients with hypopharynx or larynx cancer,

 </sup> In our study, the significant improvements in swallowing, speech, and sexuality parameters in experimental group might suggest that the implementation of comprehensive oral care program may contribute to improving QoL of HNC patients by reducing the negative impact of oral complications.
