<p>There are limitations inherent to this study. Small sample size, non-randomized clinical trial, short follow-up period (6â€Šmonths), no information about diet consumption, and poor standardization of oral care protocol are limitations that may negatively affect the validity of clinical data. Additionally, there was no oral prophylaxis procedure before the commencement of the study which could interrupt the randomization. Hence, further well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to reduce biases and identify the most effective approaches to prevent and manage oral complications and QoL in HNC patients.</p>
