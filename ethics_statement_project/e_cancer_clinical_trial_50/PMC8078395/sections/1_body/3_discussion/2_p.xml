<p>Our results suggest that preventive fluoride application protocols showed positive change in oral health status such as dental caries, dental plaque score, and gingival inflammation using paired

 </sup> Compliance to oral preventive protocols is crucial to maintaining oral health. However, compliance with fluoride application in carriers by the population of patients with HNC is generally thought to be poor and may be due to the inconvenient method of application.
