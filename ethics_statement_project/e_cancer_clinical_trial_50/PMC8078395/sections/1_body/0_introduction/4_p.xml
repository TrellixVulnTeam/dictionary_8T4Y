<p>There were several studies on the application of oral preventive programs for HNC patients undergoing radiotherapy.

 </sup> It is now well-established that prevention of dental caries for HNC patients with radiotherapy is multifaceted, involving regular dental care, maintenance of meticulous oral hygiene, fluoride use and dietary modification, minimizing consumption of cariogenic and acidic foods.

 </sup> Above mentioned preventive tools could reduce demineralization and enhance remineralization of dental hard tissue. Moreover, recent systematic review stated that professionally applied fluoride products effectively remineralise early dental caries.

 </sup> Therefore, fluoride application, dietary counseling, and oral health education including tooth brushing instruction are the methods of choice in combating dental diseases in HNC as in all patients.

 </sup> However, few studies have examined the impact of a comprehensive oral care program on oral health status and QoL for patients with HNC who received radiotherapy. The current study aims to evaluate the impact of oral care program on the oral health and QoL in patients undergoing radiotherapy for HNC.
