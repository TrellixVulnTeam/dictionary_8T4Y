<p>During the course of the study, 15 patients in the experimental group withdrew from the study (5 were inappropriate for inclusion and 10 refused to participate further). Sixteen participants in the control group withdrew (9 were inappropriate for inclusion and 7 refused to participate further). Finally, there were a total of 61 participants in the study, with 31 in the experimental group and 30 in the control group; thus, the sample size was acceptable (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The age ranged between 33 to 81 years old at the time of inclusion. Among the 61 participants, the majority was male (n = 36; 59.0%). Three fourths received more than high school education (n = 46; 75.4%) and more than 4 fifths were blue collar or unemployed (n = 50; 82.0%). More than half were former or current smoker (n = 31; 50.8%) and former or current drinker (n = 36; 59.0%). The most prevalent primary tumor site was the oral cavity or oropharynx (n = 20; 32.8%). There were no statistical significances between experimental and control group among age, gender, education, occupation, smoking, drinking, and tumor site. The characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table
