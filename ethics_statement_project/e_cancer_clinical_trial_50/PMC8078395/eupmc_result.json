All participants including control and experimental group were asked for the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire H&N35 (EORTC QLQ-H&N35) and given an oral health education 4 times at baseline, immediate postradiotherapy, 3\u200amonths after radiotherapy, and 6\u200amonths after radiotherapy. In each visit except for final, the experimental group was given fluoride varnish application and fluoride mouth rinsing solution for daily use. Oral health examination for dental caries, plaque score (PS), bleeding on probing (BOP), and salivary flow rate was performed in baseline and 6\u200amonths after radiotherapy. Statistical analyses were done by paired t-tests and mixed ANCOVA repeated-measures analysis.<h4>Results</h4>From November 1, 2013 to October 31, 2015, a total 61 patients undergoing radiotherapy for HNC cancer were enrolled (30 in control and 31 in experimental groups). Decrease in salivary flow rate was comparable between 2 groups.
