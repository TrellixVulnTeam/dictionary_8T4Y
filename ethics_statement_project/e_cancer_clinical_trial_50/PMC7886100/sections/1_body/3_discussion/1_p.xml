<p>Postoperative pain and gastrointestinal dysfunction are two major stumbling blocks that affect the recovery of patients. In addition, as far as pain is concerned, acute and chronic pain that occur during hospitalization and after discharge have caused huge medical and healthcare pressure in European and American countries.
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> This will also be one of the important issues that China will encounter in the future. In this trial, by comparing the data of POD 1â€“5, we found that TEAS can relieve the degree of pain by at least 20% overall, and the decline reached 24.6% on POD 5. This also caused a reduction in NSAID consumption by 17.8%, opioids consumption by 31.1%, and equivalent dose of morphine by approximately 3.9 mg, which meant that the average morphine consumption of patients in TG reduced by nearly half dosage. In terms of gastrointestinal function, it demonstrated a better recovery in TG. In addition, the length of postoperative stay in TG was 0.3 days shorter than CG, though the difference was not statistically significant. Combined with less consumption of analgesics and more optimized perioperative management in the future, it will be effective in reducing the economic burden of patients and hospitals.
