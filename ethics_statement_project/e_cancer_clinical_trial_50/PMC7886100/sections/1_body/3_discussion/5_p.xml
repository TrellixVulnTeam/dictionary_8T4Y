<p>Not only inner analgesics, there were changes in nociception-related factors such as trauma-induced inflammation. TNF-α and IL-6 both are important indicators to reflect the extent of stress and inflammation. TNF-α is the earliest inflammatory molecule under stress and it participates in the immunomodulation and anti-infection. IL-6 can integrate and cooperate other inflammatory signals to promote inflammation. After the patients suffering from surgical injury, the body will release a variety of nociceptive medias attributing pain. On the one hand, TNF-α and IL-6 which may overexpress under stress will increase in the injured tissue and central nervous system (CNS), then exacerbate inflammation. On the other hand, these inflammatory molecules also promote the release of phospholipids from tissue, then phospholipids break down into prostaglandins,
