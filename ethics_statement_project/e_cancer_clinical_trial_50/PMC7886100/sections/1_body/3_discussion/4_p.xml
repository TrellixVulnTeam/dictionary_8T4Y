<p>Based on the available evidence, the mechanisms of TEAS analgesia involves several systems such as endorphin system and adrenergic system, in which endorphin system plays a key role.
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Previous studies have shown that the release of different endorphins was stimulated by different frequencies and their molecular mechanisms were mediated by different receptors such as μ and κ receptors.
 <xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21–24</xref> β-End is an endogenous analgesic substance released by the pituitary chiefly, which alleviate pain through the following aspects: (1) bind to μ receptor; (2) inhibit the release of transmitters such as substance P to block pathways about pain;
