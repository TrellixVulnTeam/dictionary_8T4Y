<p>Postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction may occur because of surgical operation (damage of vagal nerve, changes in physiological structure), CO
 <sub>2</sub> pneumoperitoneum (ischemia caused by abdominal hypertension), etc. MTL is an important hormone which can promote gastrointestinal transmission and strengthen esophageal sphincter contraction to prevent gastric reflux. Emetic molecule such as 5-HT which will increase under trauma or anesthesia, can directly stimulate the vomiting center of medulla oblongata or activate the peripheral receptors in the gastrointestinal mucosa.
 <xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> From our results, we considered that TEAS promote gastrointestinal motility and reduce the incidence of nausea by regulating MTL and 5-HT. TEAS may affect 5-HT transmission by activating 5-HT and norepinephrine fibers, and TEAS may also regulate the vagal reflex to decrease the release of 5-HT in the center. Thus, the binding rate of 5-HT in gastrointestinal tract and peripheral nerve reduced.

We considered that it was related to the implementation of ERAS for its early enteral feeding and mobilization. In addition, postoperative pain and the use of opioids will further prolong the recovery of gastrointestinal function.
