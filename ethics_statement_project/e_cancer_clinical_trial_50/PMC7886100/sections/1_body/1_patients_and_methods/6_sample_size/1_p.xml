<p>The sample size justification of this trial was based on the preliminary data of pain scores which was from a pilot study we previously performed in our center. The results of the pilot study showed that the average pain score of POD 1–5 were 2.80±0.45 and 3.20±0.72 for TG and CG groups, respectively. With an equal randomization and assuming the dropout rate was less than 10%, a sample size of 82 patients (41 in the TG and 41 in the CG) will ensure the power was at least 80% to detect the difference at a significant level of 0.05, using a two-sided
