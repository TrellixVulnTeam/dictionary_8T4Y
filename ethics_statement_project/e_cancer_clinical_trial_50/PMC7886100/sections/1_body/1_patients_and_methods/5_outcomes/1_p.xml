<p>The primary outcomes of this trial were as follows: (1) Pain score. We used numerical rating scale (NRS, in 10 levels and we have improved the basic unit by dividing the 10 levels into 20 levels, ie, 0.5 as a unit) combined with the Wong-Baker faces pain rating scale. We recorded the pain score at 6-time points (last night till 8:00, 8:00, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00, time before sleep) a day from POD 1 to POD 5. On POD 0, we recorded the pain scores at the awake time postoperatively and other time points at the above. (2) Consumption of analgesics. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were used for mild to moderate pain, and opioids were used for moderate to severe pain. We used NSAIDs (flurbiprofen axetil) once on POD 1 regularly and then we made prescriptions according to the conditions of patients. And we recorded consumption of NSAIDs by doses and opioids by equivalent doses of morphine (pethidine: pentazocine: dezocine: morphine=100mg: 30â€“60mg: 10mg: 10mg). It should be noted that all patients enrolled did not use PCA.</p>
