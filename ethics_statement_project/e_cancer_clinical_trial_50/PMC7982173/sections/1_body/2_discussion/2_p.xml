<p>After operation, the gastrointestinal tract of patients with esophageal cancer is mostly in a state of hypodynamic, and up to 50% of patients will have disturbance of gastric emptying, gastric dumping syndrome, dysphagia and other phenomena, which can lead to enteral nutritional intolerance, adverse reactions such as reflux, vomiting, abdominal distension, constipation, diarrhea, and even serious complications such as aspiration pneumonia and severe malnutrition.

 </sup> Due to perioperative fasting, gastrointestinal mucosal cells lack of food stimulation for a long time, ischemia and hypoxia lead to the decrease of mucosal cell proliferation and repair ability, the weakening of barrier function, and the weakening of immune defense.

The high metabolism caused by surgical destruction of the mucosal barrier and stress is prone to acid-base imbalance, electrolyte disturbance, early postoperative gastrointestinal intolerance and so on to further aggravate the imbalance of gastrointestinal flora.
