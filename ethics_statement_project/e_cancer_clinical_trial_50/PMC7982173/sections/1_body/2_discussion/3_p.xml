It can also reduce the degree of abdominal distension caused by gastrointestinal motility deficiency, increase the frequency of intestinal peristalsis, maintain intestinal peristaltic continuity,

 </sup> At present, there are few clinical studies on the application of probiotics for postoperative patients with esophageal cancer, and it is still controversial whether probiotics is beneficial to postoperative patients with esophageal cancer. Therefore, we intend to use this randomized controlled study to explore the effects of probiotics on gastrointestinal complications and nutritional status in postoperative patients with esophageal cancer.
