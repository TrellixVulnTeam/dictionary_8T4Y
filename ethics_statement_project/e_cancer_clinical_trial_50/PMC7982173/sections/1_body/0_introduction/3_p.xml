 </sup> Normal alimentary tract flora plays an important role in host nutrient metabolism, drug metabolism, maintenance of intestinal mucosal barrier structural integrity, immune regulation, etc. It has been shown that the supplementation of probiotics can adjust the composition of the maladjusted flora in the body, maintain the microecological balance, and promote the recovery and health of the body.
