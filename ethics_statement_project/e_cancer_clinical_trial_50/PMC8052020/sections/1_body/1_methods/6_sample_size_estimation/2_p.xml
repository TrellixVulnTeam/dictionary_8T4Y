<p>PASS software was used to estimate the sample size. In this study. According to the literature and our preliminary studies,
 <sup>[
  <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
  <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]
 </sup> the effective rates of the control group and the experimental group were respectively 53% and 75%. The two groups were distributed in a 1:1 ratio under the conditions of α = 0.05 and test efficiency, 1-β = 0.8. At a result, the sample size of each group was calculated to be at least 71 people. Considering the existence of factors such as shedding, the samples were expanded by 12% on the premise of ensuring the minimum sample size, and finally the samples were expanded to 80 cases in each of the two groups, a total of 160 cases.
