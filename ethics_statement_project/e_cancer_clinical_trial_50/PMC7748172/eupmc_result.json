It was approved by the Ethics Committee of People's Hospital of Chengyang District (03982790). This study includes 90 patients with advanced lung cancer. Patients diagnosed at our oncology clinic are eligible if they are diagnosed within 8 weeks of a novel diagnosis of stage 3 or stage 4 lung cancer. Patients with hepatic insufficiency, renal failure, and respiratory and heart failure, as well as a series of severe mental illness are excluded from our research. Patients are divided randomly into the intervention group and control group, each group is assigned 45 patients.
