<p id="Par22">The follow-up time ranged from 36 to 48 months (median: 37 months). 3-year overall survival rate of the whole cohort was 92, 87.9% in experimental group and 100% in control group respectively (

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). The 3-year RFS rates of patients who underwent HIPEC or not were 84.8 and 88.2% respectively (

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Prognostic factors were pathological T stage, N stage, pTNM stage and tumor differentiation by univariate analysis (

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a-d). Multivariate analysis of RFS showed that only pathological T stage (RR 15.071,
