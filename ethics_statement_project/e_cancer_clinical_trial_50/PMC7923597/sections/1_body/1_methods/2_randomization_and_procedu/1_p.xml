<p id="Par16">After radical gastrectomy, patients were randomly divided into two groups (a two-to-one ratio), namely, the experimental group (included patients who were treated with HIPEC followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with SOX regime) and the control group (included patients who underwent adjuvant chemotherapy with SOX regime alone). Randomization was performed via a computer generated sequence. In the experimental group, HIPEC was performed under general anesthesia after radical gastrectomy. Two outlet pipes and one inlet pipe were installed. Cisplatin (50 mg/L) was diluted in heated 0.9% sodium chloride and then circulated for 30 min. Perfusion rate was 400–500 ml/min. The circulation temperature was 42.5 °C - 43.0 °C. HIPEC perfusion and circulation was performed with BR-TRG-II (Bright Medical Technology Co.,Ltd., Guangzhou, China). After the HIPEC was finished, at least 90% of perfusion fluid was removed.</p>
