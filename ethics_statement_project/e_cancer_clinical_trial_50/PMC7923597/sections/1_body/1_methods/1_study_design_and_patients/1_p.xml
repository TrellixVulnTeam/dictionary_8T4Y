<p id="Par15">This was a prospective, randomized, single center study conducted from March 2015 to November 2016. Patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (cT3-4 N0-3 M0) treated with radical gastrectomy at the Gastrointestinal Cancer Center of Peking University Cancer Hospital &amp; Institute were enrolled. The clinical stage of patients was based on radiology results. There was no distant metastasis such as liver metastasis, lung metastasis and peritoneal metastasis in all patients. Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed that they all had negative cytology. According to the preliminary data, the peritoneal recurrence rate is 35% within 1 year after radical surgery in locally advanced gastric cancer patients treated without HIPEC (the control group proportion: 0.35), while that is 10% in patients treated with HIPEC (the experimental group proportion: 0.10). In this trial, the allocation ratio of patients in the experimental group and the control group is 2:1. The experimental group proportion is assumed to be 0.32 under the null hypothesis and 0.10 under the alternative hypothesis. The test statistic used is the two-sided Z test (unpooled). Using PASS 11, the required sample size should be 116 patients (77 patients in the experimental group and 39 patients in the control group), with a two-sided alpha level of 5% and a power of 80%. However, the trial was prematurely terminated after 50 patients enrolled, owing to the end of cooperation with the company that provided the HIPEC system (BR-TRG-II). This study was approved by the Ethics committee of Peking University Cancer Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The study adhered to CONSORT guidelines and it was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000038331).</p>
