<p id="Par26">This study has some limitations. In this randomized trial, only 50 patients were enrolled, the sample size may not be big enough to reach a statistically significant difference when comparing the HIPEC group with the control group (type-2 error). Secondly, this was a prospective controlled study. The inclusion criteria of locally advanced gastric cancer patients were based on clinical staging. CT scans were performed for the T staging. Studies have shown that the diagnostic accuracy of CT in determining T stage of gastric cancer was about 73.8â€“82.7% [

These patients were less likely to have peritoneal metastasis or cancer recurrence after radical surgery. This might have influenced the results of the study.
