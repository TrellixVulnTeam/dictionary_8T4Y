<p id="Par24">Previous studies that investigated the role of HIPEC for preventing peritoneal recurrence in locally advanced gastric cancer have shown contradictory findings. Kang LY from Taiwan reported that radical gastrectomy with HIPEC had a better prognosis for locally advanced gastric cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The 3-year DFS was 28.87% for patients who received surgery, while up to 66.03% for patients underwent surgery followed by HIPEC. The cancer recurrence was delayed in patients treated with HIPEC. In a recent study, Reutovich MY showed HIPEC with cisplatin and doxorubicin reduced metachronous peritoneal metastasis in radically operated serosa-invasive gastric cancer patients [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. On the other hand, the PHOENIX-GC trial failed to show a survival benefit of intraperitoneal paclitaxel plus systemic chemotherapy in gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In the trial JCOG9206â€“2, adjuvant chemotherapy with intraperitoneal and intravenous cisplatin after radical gastrectomy did not improve patient overall and relapse free survival for patients with serosa-positive gastric cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. It should be noted that only 39% of patients who were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy actually completed the regime. Some patients have undergone radical gastrectomy with D2+ lymphadenectomy. For these two reasons, a possible effect of intraperitoneal chemotherapy as prophylaxis against peritoneal recurrence could not be excluded.
