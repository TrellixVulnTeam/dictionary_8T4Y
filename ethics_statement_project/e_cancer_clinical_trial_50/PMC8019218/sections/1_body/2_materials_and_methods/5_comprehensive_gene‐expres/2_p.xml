<p>We performed comprehensive gene‐expression analysis using the Whole Human Genome 4 x 44K Microarray (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Briefly, we collected tumor cells by macrodissection and performed comprehensive gene‐expression analysis, as previously described.

Gene‐expression data were analyzed and imaged using GeneSpring GX version 14.5 (Agilent Technologies). The patients with aCRCS were classified into 4 subtypes, A1, A2, B1, and B2, as previously described.
