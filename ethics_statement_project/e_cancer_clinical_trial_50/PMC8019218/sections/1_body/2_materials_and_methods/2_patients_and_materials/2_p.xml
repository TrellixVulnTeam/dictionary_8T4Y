<p>The TRICOLORE trial for untreated mCRC was designed in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Ethical Guidelines for Medical and Health Research Involving Human Subjects. The TR of the TRICOLORE trial was approved by the institutional review board of each participated facility. Only patients who provided informed consent for the TR before the start of treatment were included. We collected 335 (68.8%) FFPE samples from surgical or biopsy specimens of the primary tumor of 487 patients registered in the TRICOLORE trial. The number of patients in the control group (mFOLFOX6 or CapeOX + bevacizumab; OX group) was 169, and the number in the test group (S‐1 and irinotecan + bevacizumab; IRI group) was 166.</p>
