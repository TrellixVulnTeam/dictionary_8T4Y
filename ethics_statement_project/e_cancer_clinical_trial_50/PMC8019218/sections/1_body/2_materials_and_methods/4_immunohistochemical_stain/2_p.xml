<p>Immunohistochemical staining of mismatch repair (MMR)‐related proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) and PTEN was performed at the Department of Pathology, Tohoku University Hospital, Japan, using the following antibodies: an anti‐human mouse MLH‐1 clone G168‐15 (1/100; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), an anti‐MSH2 mouse mAb clone FE11 (1/200; Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), an anti‐MSH6 mouse clone 44 (1/1000; BD Biosciences), an anti‐PMS2 mouse clone 16‐4 (1/100; BD Biosciences), and a PTEN clone 6H2.1 (1/100; DAKO, Carpinteria, CA, USA). Cases in which nuclei were stained were deemed positive for MMR‐related proteins, while cases in which the cytoplasm was stained were deemed positive for PTEN.</p>
