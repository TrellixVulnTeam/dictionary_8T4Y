All statistical analyses were performed using JMP Pro version 15.0.0 (SAS, Cary, NC, USA). We used two‐sided Fisher exact test and Wilcoxon rank‐sum test (or Kruskal‐Wallis test) for patient background, tumor response, and adverse events analysis. The PFS and OS were estimated using the Kaplan‐Meier method, and the log rank test was used for between‐group comparison. In addition, we performed univariate analyses of molecular markers that may contribute to the PFS or OS using a Cox proportional hazards model and calculated the HR and its CI. Wilcoxon rank‐sum test was used to compare RDI, tumor reduction and excision repair cross‐complementing 1 (
