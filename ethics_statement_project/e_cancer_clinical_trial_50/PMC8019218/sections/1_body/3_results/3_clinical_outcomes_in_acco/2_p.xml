<p>In accordance with PFS subgroup analysis results (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>), the PFS of the IRI group was significantly better compared with the OX group in 
 <italic>BRAF</italic> WT, PTEN‐positive, and aCRCS A1 patients. In no molecular subtypes was the PFS of the OX group better compared with the IRI group. In the interaction test, only the aCRCS was a significant predictive factor for the PFS after OX‐based and IRI‐based therapies.
