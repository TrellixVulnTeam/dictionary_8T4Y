<p>Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the CONSORT diagram for this study. There were no differences in patient characteristics between the parental TRICOLORE and TR cohorts (Table 
 <xref rid="cas14841-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). The PFS and OS in the TR cohort were almost the same as those in the entire TRICOLORE cohort (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). In the clinicopathological and molecular background (Table 
 <xref rid="cas14841-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>), we found a significant between‐group difference only in aCRCS.
