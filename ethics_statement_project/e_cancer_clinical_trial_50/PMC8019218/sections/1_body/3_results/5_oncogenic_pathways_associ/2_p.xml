<p>GSEA analysis was performed to identify the oncogenic pathways associated with aCRCS. The results of the GSEA (top 20 of enriched gene sets) are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="cas14841-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>. 
 <italic>KRAS</italic> signaling pathways were markedly enriched in aCRCS A1 + B1 compared with A2. In aCRCS B2 compared with A1 + B1 and B2 compared with A2, 
 <italic>KRAS</italic> signaling pathways were also markedly enriched. These data indicated that activation of 
 <italic>KRAS</italic> was low in A2, intermediate in A1 + B1 and high in B2.
