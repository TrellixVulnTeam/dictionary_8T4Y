<p>The PFS by all subtypes of aCRCS in OX‐based treatment group and in IRI‐based treatment group are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>. In OX‐based treatment group, PFS of aCRCS B2 was significantly better than that of aCRCS A1 + B1 (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>A). Conversely, in the IRI‐based treatment group, there were no significant difference in PFS between all subtypes (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>B).
