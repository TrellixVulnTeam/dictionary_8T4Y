<p>Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows the best reduction in the target lesion size from the baseline. Tumor shrinkage in the IRI group was better compared with the OX group in aCRCS A1 + B1 (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>), while it was better in the OX group compared with the IRI group in aCRCS B2 (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). All patients in the OX group showed a reduction in the target lesion size in aCRCS B2. The trend in tumor shrinkage was similar between the OX and IRI groups in aCRCS A2 (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). Best overall response was shown in Table
