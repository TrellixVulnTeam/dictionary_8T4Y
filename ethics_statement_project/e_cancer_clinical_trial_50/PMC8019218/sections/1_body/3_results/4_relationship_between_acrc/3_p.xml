<p>Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows survival curves of the PFS. The PFS of the IRI group was significantly better compared with the OX group in aCRCS A1 (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). The PFS of the IRI group was better compared with the OX group in aCRCS B1 (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>), although the difference was not statistically significant. In contrast, the PFS of the OX group was better compared with the IRI group in aCRCS B2 although the difference was not statistically significant (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). In aCRCS A2, the PFS in both groups was comparable (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>).
