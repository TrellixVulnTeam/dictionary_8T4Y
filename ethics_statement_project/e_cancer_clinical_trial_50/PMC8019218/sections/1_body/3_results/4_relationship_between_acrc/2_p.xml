<p>Table 
 <xref rid="cas14841-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> presents the clinicopathological and molecular backgrounds in all aCRCS. The patient backgrounds of the OX and IRI groups were generally well balanced, and there was little chance that the patient background affected the clinical outcomes of OX‐based and IRI‐based therapies (Table 
 <xref rid="cas14841-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). There were significantly fewer PTEN‐negative cases in the OX group compared with the IRI group in aCRCS A2. There were more CIMP‐positive cases in the IRI group compared with the OX group in aCRCS B1. No other factors differed between the 2 groups.
