<p>PCA results of aCRCS are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Notably, aCRCS A1 and B1 were close to each other, indicating that some fractions of the gene‐expression patterns among aCRCS A1 and B1 are similar. Since aCRCS A1 and B1 had relatively similar gene‐expression patterns and similar therapeutic effects for OX and IRI, we considered them as a single subtype (A1 + B1) in terms of OX‐based and IRI‐based therapy selection. The PFS of the IRI group was significantly better compared with the OX group (HR = 0.58; 95% CI = 0.41‐0.82; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .0023) in aCRCS A1 + B1 (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>).
