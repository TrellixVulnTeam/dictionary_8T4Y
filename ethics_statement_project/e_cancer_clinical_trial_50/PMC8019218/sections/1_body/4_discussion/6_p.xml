<p>From the adverse events data (Table 
 <xref rid="cas14841-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>), in aCRCS A1 + B1, the incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse events of leucopenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, and thromboembolism was significantly higher in the IRI group compared with in the OX group. The reason for this may be due to the significantly longer duration for IRI‐based treatment compared with the duration for OX‐based treatment in aCRCS A1 + B1. Therefore, the total doses of cytotoxic drugs and bevacizumab would be higher in the IRI group than in the OX group.
