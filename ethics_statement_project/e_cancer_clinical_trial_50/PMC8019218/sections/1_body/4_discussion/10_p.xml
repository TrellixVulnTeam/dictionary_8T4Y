<p>This is the first report on specific CRC subtypes based on comprehensive molecular analysis: (a) being related to OX and IRI efficacy, and (b) being a biomarker in mCRC. However, this study had a few limitations. First, the TRICOLORE trial was conducted on a Japanese population. Second, S‐1 is not widely used as for mCRC treatment in the West. Third, this was an exploratory study, and future validation studies are needed to determine the significance of aCRCS as a biomarker for OX‐based and IRI‐based therapy selection.</p>
