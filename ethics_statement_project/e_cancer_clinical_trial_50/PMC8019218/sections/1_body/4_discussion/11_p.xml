<p>In conclusion, the PFS after IRI‐based therapy was significantly better compared with OX‐based therapy in the aCRCS A1 + B1 group. aCRCS may be a predictive factor of the outcomes of OX‐based and IRI‐based therapies. Given that IRI has advantages in the proportion of sensitive cases and QOL, the therapeutic strategy of selecting IRI as the first‐line treatment for mCRC may be effective.</p>
