<p>The OS did not differ significantly after OX‐based and IRI‐based therapies among aCRCS, but this might be because IRI is used in 60.7% of OX patients and OX is used in 56.6% of IRI patients as second‐line treatment.

 </xref> In considering treatment strategies for mCRC, the key issue is QOL. Chemotherapy‐induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) by OX are long lasting and reduce QOL.

 </xref> To decrease the duration of CIPN, it is better to use OX in later line treatment. Therefore, IRI as first‐line treatment may be preferable in aCRCS A1 + B1, who are more responsive to IRI than to OX, and in subtype A2, who have similar responsivity to both OX and IRI.
