<p>Okita et al reported the relationship between CMS and the efficacy of OX and IRI using a cohort of 193 patients with mCRC.

 </xref> In that report, PFS, and OS were significantly better in the IRI group than in the OX group in CMS4. In CMS2 and CMS3, PFS of both groups was equivalent. Unfortunately, we were unable to replicate those results; our results exhibited the same trend as that of Okita et al. CMS was developed using gene‐expression data of early‐stage CRC and mCRC, whereas aCRCS was developed using the gene‐expression data of unresectable or recurrent colorectal cancer only. It is possible that aCRCS, which is specific to the classification of mCRC, may have an advantage in predicting the sensitivity of OX and IRI to mCRC.
