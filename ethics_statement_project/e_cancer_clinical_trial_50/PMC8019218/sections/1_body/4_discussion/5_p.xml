<p>From GSEA, 
 <italic>KRAS</italic> signaling activation was highest in aCRCS B2 among aCRCS (Table 
 <xref rid="cas14841-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). It was reported that 
 <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant colorectal cancer cell lines were sensitive to OX compared with 
 <italic>KRAS</italic> WT colorectal cancer cell lines.

 </xref> Therefore, the degree of activation of 
 <italic>KRAS</italic> signaling may be responsible for the better PFS in aCRCS B2 and the poorer PFS in A1 + B1 and A2 in the OX‐based treatment group (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>A). Furthermore, the expression level of the 
 <italic>ERCC1</italic> gene, which is considered to be a predictor of the efficacy of OX, was significantly higher in aCRCS A1 + B1 than in the other subtypes, suggesting that the sensitivity to OX might be poorer in aCRCS A1 + B1 than in the others (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>). In fact, the PFS of OX tended to be better in aCRCS A2 compared with in aCRCS A1 + B1 (
 <italic>P</italic> = .11) (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>A). In contrast, regardless of the aCRCS subtype, the sensitivity of IRI was consistently good (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>B). Therefore, the reason why the sensitivity of IRI was better than that of OX in aCRCS A1 (or aCRCS A1 + B1) was the poor sensitivity of OX due to 
 <italic>KRAS</italic> signaling activation and ERCC1 expression. In contrast, the reason why the PFS was not different between OX and IRI in aCRCS A2 might be the intermediate sensitivity of OX.
