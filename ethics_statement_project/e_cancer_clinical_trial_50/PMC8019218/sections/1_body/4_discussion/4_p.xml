<p>Among the molecular factors, aCRCS were only associated with the PFS of OX and IRI groups (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In aCRCS A1 and B1, IRI‐based therapy led to better PFS compared with OX‐based therapy, while in aCRCS B2, OX‐based therapy led to better PFS compared with IRI‐based therapy. The aCRCS A1 and B1 are close to each other on the gene‐expression profile by PCA (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), and the 2 groups have similar therapeutic outcomes with OX and IRI. In aCRCS A1 + B1, IRI‐based therapy led to better PFS (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E) and better tumor shrinkage compared with OX‐based therapy (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>), although the RDI of IRI tends to be lower compared with OX (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14841-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>). These findings consistently suggest that aCRCS A1 + B1 are more responsive to IRI compared with OX. In aCRCS B2, the PFS, and tumor shrinkage after OX‐based therapy are better compared with IRI‐based therapy, despite the lack of significant differences between the RDIs of OX and IRI. These findings suggest that aCRCS B2 is more responsive to OX compared with IRI. Taken together, aCRCS, which enabled the classification of mCRC into 3 subtypes, A1 + B1, A2, and B2, can be a biomarker for predicting the PFS after OX‐based and IRI‐based therapies.
