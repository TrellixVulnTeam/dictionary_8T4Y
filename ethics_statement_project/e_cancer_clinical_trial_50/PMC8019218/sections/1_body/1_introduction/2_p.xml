<p>Oxaliplatin (OX)‐based and irinotecan (IRI)‐based therapies are commonly used as first‐line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).

 </xref> Prospective studies comparing OX‐based or IRI‐based therapy with bevacizumab have shown that the median PFS with OX‐based therapy is 10.1‐10.8 mo, while that with IRI‐based therapy is 12.1‐14.0 mo.

 </xref> The PFS after IRI‐based therapy is consistently better compared with OX‐based therapy, although the difference was not statistically significant.

 </xref> One of the reasons for this difference is believed to be the difficulty in continuing OX‐based combination therapy for a long period because of long‐lasting peripheral neuropathy.

 </xref> Therefore, IRI is thought to be better compared with OX in terms of the quality of life (QOL).

 </xref> Although OX is used more frequently than IRI as a first‐line treatment for mCRC worldwide, the above information suggests that IRI‐based therapy might be more suitable than OX‐based therapy as a first‐line treatment. If some patient subtypes show better outcomes with IRI‐based compared with OX‐based therapy, then IRI can be recommended for them.
