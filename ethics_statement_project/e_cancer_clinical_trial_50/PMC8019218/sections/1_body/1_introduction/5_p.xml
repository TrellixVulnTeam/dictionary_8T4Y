<p>The TRICOLORE trial is an open‐label, multicenter, randomized phase III trial that examines the noninferiority of bevacizumab + IRI + S‐1 combination therapy to bevacizumab + OX‐based combination therapy (mFOLFOX6 or CapeOX) in terms of the PFS in untreated mCRC; the noninferiority of the former therapy has been statistically confirmed, and supports previous studies reporting IRI‐based therapy as moderately superior.
