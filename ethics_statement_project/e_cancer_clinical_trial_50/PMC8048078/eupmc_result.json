Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) has shown promise in the treatment of oligometastatic disease, but the utility of SABR in treating all sites of polymetastatic disease has yet to be evaluated. This study aims to evaluate the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of SABR in patients with polymetastatic disease.<h4>Methods</h4>Up to 48 patients with polymetastatic cancer (>\u200910 sites) will be enrolled on this phase I, modified 3\u2009+\u20093 design trial. Eligible patients will have exhausted (or refused) standard systemic therapy options. SABR will be delivered as an escalating number of weekly fractions of 6\u2009Gy, starting at 6\u2009Gy\u2009\u00d7\u20092 weekly fractions (dose level 1). The highest dose level (dose level 4) will be 6\u2009Gy\u2009\u00d7\u20095 weekly fractions. Feasibility and safety of SABR will be evaluated 6\u2009weeks following treatment using a composite endpoint of successfully completing treatment as well as toxicity outcomes.<h4>Discussion</h4>This study will be the first to explore delivering SABR in patients with polymetastatic disease. SABR will be planned using the guiding principles of: strict adherence to dose constraints, minimization of treatment burden, and minimization of toxicity. As this represents a novel use of radiotherapy, our phase I study will allow for careful selection of the MTD for exploration in future studies.<h4>Trial registration</h4>This trial was prospectively registered in ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT04530513 on August 28, 2020.", "affiliation": "Division of Radiation Oncology, Department of Oncology, London Health Sciences Centre, 790 Commissioners Rd.
