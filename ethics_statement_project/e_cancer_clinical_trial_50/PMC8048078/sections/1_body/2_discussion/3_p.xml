<p id="Par123">Further rationale for exploring SABR in the polymetastatic setting comes from emerging randomized evidence that supports aggressive radiotherapy to the primary tumour, either with SABR or conventional (chemo) radiation in patients newly diagnosed with polymetastatic prostate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and nasopharyngeal cancers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. For these tumour types, improvements in progression-free and overall survival have been observed with reasonable side effect profiles. Sites of oligometastatic/polymetastatic disease were not routinely treated with radiotherapy in these studies, leading to the hypothesis that outcomes could possibly be improved further with the addition of SABR, assuming it can be safely delivered.
