<p id="Par125">Our study population was carefully considered for creation of this novel phase I trial. We chose to evaluate a subset of patients where systemic therapy use at the time of SABR is unlikely to interfere acutely with the evaluation of the MTD, as no standard systemic therapy options are available (or are refused by the patient). It is also unlikely that any toxicity from SABR in this study would interfere with the possibility of receiving subsequent systemic therapy that may become available or the patient chooses to access. However, patients enrolled on this study are expected to have been heavily pretreated with systemic therapy, which may influence secondary endpoints in our trial such as progression-free survival and overall survival. Some have argued phase I trials should be offered earlier in the treatment pathway for patients [

Whether there is an upper limit to the number of lesions that can safely be targeted in SABR remains to be seen. For this trial, we have arbitrarily chosen 50 targets. More likely, it is the relative distribution, size, and proximity of metastases to critical organs at risk that will determine the maximum number of lesions that can safely be treated. Valuable information regarding the variety of anatomic scenarios when considering polymetastatic disease will be gained through this experience.
