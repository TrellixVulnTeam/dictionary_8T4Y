<p id="Par122">Precedent for the treatment of extensive metastatic disease with radiotherapy exists in the experience of using hemi-body radiotherapy for palliation of diffuse bone metastases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], as well as the use of radio-ligand or systemic radiopharmaceuticals for the treatment of metastases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Treating the entire body with total body radiation is not feasible due severe bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract dysfunction, side effects seen when total body irradiation is purposefully given as part of a stem cell transplant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, with modern radiation planning software and delivery platforms, we believe it is feasible and practical to give SABR to all sites of polymetastatic disease while minimizing doses to organs at risk.
