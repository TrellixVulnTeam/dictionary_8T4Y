<p id="Par35">This is a modified 3 + 3 design Phase I dose escalation trial. Participants will be from a single tertiary academic radiotherapy department in Canada. Three patients will initially be treated at dose level 1, 12 Gy in 2 fractions over 2 weeks, with evaluation of toxicity occurring 6 weeks after completion of treatment. If the composite co-primary endpoints are met, subsequent dose escalations will be accomplished by increasing the number of 6 Gy weekly fractions up to a maximum dose level of 30 Gy in 5 fractions over 5 weeks (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Given the potentially wide variety of anatomic scenarios for polymetastatic disease and the potential planning challenges beyond clinical tolerability, dosimetric planning feasibility will be evaluated with a planning success rate of greater than 33% deemed as acceptable for each dose level. Thus, a total of 12 patients per dose level could potentially be accrued to fully determine the clinical and technical feasibility.
