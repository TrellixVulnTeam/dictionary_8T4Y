<p id="Par118">The DSMC will meet annually after study initiation to review toxicity. The DSMC will review the chart of any case of grade 4–5 toxicity to determine if such toxicity is related to treatment. If the DSMC deems that toxicity rates are excessive (&gt; 40% grade 4 toxicity, or any grade 5 toxicity), then the DSMC can, at its discretion, recommend cessation of the trial, dose adjustment, or exclusion of certain treatment sites and/or delivery techniques that are deemed as high-risk for complications.</p>
