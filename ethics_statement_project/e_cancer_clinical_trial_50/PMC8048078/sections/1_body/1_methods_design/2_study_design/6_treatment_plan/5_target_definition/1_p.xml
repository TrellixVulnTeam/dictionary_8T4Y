For patients with lymph node metastases, a targetable lesion will be considered as a lymph node &gt; 10 mm in short axis or with radiographic features strongly suspicious for metastatic involvement (i.e. presence of necrosis, uptake of radiotracer in PET). Lung metastases will be considered for treatment when the short axis is &gt; 8 mm or radiographic features are strongly suspicious for metastatic involvement (i.e. uptake of radiotracer in PET).</p>
