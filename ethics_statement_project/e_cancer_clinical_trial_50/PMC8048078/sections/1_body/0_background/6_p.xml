However, it is only with recent advances in radiotherapy planning and delivery technology that SABR can be considered as potentially feasible to treat all sites of polymetastatic cancer. Given that SABR has shown promise in providing progression-free and overall survival advantages in the oligometastatic state, we postulate that the benefits of stereotactic radiotherapy may not be limited only to those with oligometastases.
