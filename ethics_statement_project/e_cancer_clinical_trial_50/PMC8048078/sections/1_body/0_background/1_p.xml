<p id="Par26">In patients who have metastatic cancer, cancer which has spread beyond the primary site to other distant sites in the body [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], the standard of care treatment is most often systemic therapy. Systemic therapy, which may include hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy and/or immunotherapy, has been the cornerstone of providing progression-free and overall survival advantages in patients who have metastatic cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. While systemic radiotherapy in the form of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals are available or emerging as treatment for some polymetastatic cancers (i.e. neuroendocrine, thyroid, prostate cancer) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], in most cases this treatment has been limited to the palliation of bone disease with bone seeking radiopharmaceuticals [
