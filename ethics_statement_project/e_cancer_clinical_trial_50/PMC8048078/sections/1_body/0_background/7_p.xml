<p id="Par32">The toxicity of SABR may depend primarily on the doses of radiotherapy delivered to organs at risk, rather than the number of metastatic sites treated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. For serial organs, such as the spinal cord, reducing the maximum point dose of radiation is expected to reduce the probability of toxicity. For parallel organs, such as the kidney and lung, reducing a critical volume of the organ receiving radiation from a specific dose of radiation is expected to reduce the probability of toxicity. For this trial, we will employ strict dose constraints for both serial and parallel structures which have been established as safe when utilizing SABR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. At the same time, cumulative low doses to larger volumes of tissue can be expected and may be a source of toxicity, although older literature employing hemi-body radiation suggests these doses may be tolerable [
