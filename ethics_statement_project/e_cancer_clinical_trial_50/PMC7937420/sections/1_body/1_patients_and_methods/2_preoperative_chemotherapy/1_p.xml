<p>We adopted the DCS regimen reported by Koizumi et al. (
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) because of its low toxicity and high response rate among various DCS regimens. Docetaxel (40 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup>) and cisplatin (60 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup>) were administered by intravenous infusion on day 1 of each cycle, and S-1 (80 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup>) was given orally for the first 14 days of a 28-day cycle. After the completion of two cycles of chemotherapy or when the continuation of chemotherapy was difficult, the possibility of curative resection was evaluated. If macroscopically curative resection was considered possible, the patients underwent surgery within 42 days after the last administration of S-1.
