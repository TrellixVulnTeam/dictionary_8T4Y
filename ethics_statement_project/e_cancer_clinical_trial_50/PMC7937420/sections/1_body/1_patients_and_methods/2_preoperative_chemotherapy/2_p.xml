<p>Chemotherapy-related toxicities were evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. The subsequent chemotherapy cycle was delayed until patient recovery, including the following parameters: WBC count ≥3000/mm
 <sup>3</sup>; neutrophil count ≥1500/mm
 <sup>3</sup>; platelet count ≥100 000/mm
 <sup>3</sup>; AST and ALT levels ≤2.5x ULN; total bilirubin level ≤1.5x ULN; creatinine level ≤1.5 mg/dL and creatinine clearance ≥60 ml/min/body; diarrhea or stomatitis grade ≤1; and other non-hematological adverse event grade ≤2. The DCS doses were reduced in the event of a WBC count ≤1000/mm
 <sup>3</sup>; neutrophil count ≤500/mm
 <sup>3</sup>; platelet count ≤50 000/mm
 <sup>3</sup>; or grade ≥3 non-hematological adverse events.
