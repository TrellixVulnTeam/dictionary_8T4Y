<p>The pRR of preoperative chemotherapy with CS for type 4 tumors or large type 3 tumors in JCOG 0210 and for bulky or paraaortic lymph node metastasis in JCOG 0405 were 49 and 51%, respectively (
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). DCS therapy was expected to be more effective but more toxic than CS therapy. Based on these data, we calculated that the required number of patients was 25 patients, assuming that the threshold and expected pRR were 40 and 65%, respectively, with a one-sided α error of 0.05 and a β error of 0.2. Considering the possibility of dropouts and ineligible patients, 30 patients were required.
