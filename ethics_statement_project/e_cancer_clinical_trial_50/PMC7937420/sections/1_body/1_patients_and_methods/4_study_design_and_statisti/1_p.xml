<p>This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative DCS therapy in patients with locally advanced gastric cancer. The primary endpoint was the pRR, and the secondary endpoints were chemotherapy-related toxicities, morbidity and mortality as short-term outcomes and the overall and relapse-free survival as long-term outcomes. Because the required follow-up period has not yet been reached, long-term results are premature and will be reported by 2022.</p>
