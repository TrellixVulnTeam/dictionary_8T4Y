<p>Tumors were staged according to the 13th edition of the Japanese Gastric Cancer Classification (
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, in this paper, we translated the stages to the 14th edition (
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), which was integrated with the 7th edition of AJCC cancer staging (
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The eligibility criteria were as follows: (i) histologically proven gastric adenocarcinoma, (ii) macroscopic type 4, large (major axis &gt;8 cm) macroscopic type 3, or bulky lymph node metastasis (one lymph node 
 <bold>≥</bold>3 cm or two adjacent lymph nodes 
 <bold>≥</bold>1.5 cm along the celiac, common or proper hepatic, or splenic arteries), (iii) macroscopically resectable gastric cancer without distant metastasis diagnosed by thoracic/abdominal/pelvic computed tomography and staging laparoscopy, (iv) esophageal invasion &lt;3 cm, (v) age 20–80 years, (vi) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0–1, (vii) no previous history of chemotherapy or radiation therapy for any other cancer, and no previous history of surgery for gastric cancer, with the exception of bypass surgery, (viii) an adequate organ function (white blood cell [WBC] count ≥3000/mm
 <sup>3</sup> and ≤12 000/mm
 <sup>3</sup>; hemoglobin level ≥9.0 g/dl; platelet count ≥100 000/mm
 <sup>3</sup>; aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT] levels ≤2.5x the upper limit of normal [ULN]; total bilirubin level ≤1.5 mg/dL; creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL and creatinine clearance ≥60 ml/min/body in the Cockcroft–Gault equation) and (ix) written informed consent.
