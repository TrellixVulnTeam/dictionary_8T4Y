<p>In this study, chemotherapy-related toxicities were relatively mild. In particular, the incidence of FN was 6.5%, which was similar to the results of the JCOG 1002 (5.7%) and KDOG 1001 (7.5%) trials, which used the same dosing regimen as this study (

 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Conversely, the incidence of FN in patients treated with higher-dose DCS therapy was reported to be 16.3% (
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Generally, FN requires a long time to recover, and the long chemotherapy-free interval may help tumor progression and prevent subsequent surgery. Fortunately, gastrectomy was performed in 30 of 31 patients (96.8%) in the present study, with one patient unable to undergo gastrectomy due to tumor progression.
