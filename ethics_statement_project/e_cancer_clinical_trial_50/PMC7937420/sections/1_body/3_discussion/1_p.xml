<p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative chemotherapy with DCS in patients with marginally resectable advanced gastric cancer, including patients with type 4 tumors, larger type 3 tumors or bulky lymph node metastasis. Although the chemotherapy-related toxicities and surgical complications as secondary endpoints were feasible, the pRR as the primary endpoint was higher than the threshold value but lower than the expected rate. These results suggested that our DCS regimen was less toxic but not sufficiently effective to justify proceeding to a phase III trial.</p>
