<p>Postoperative complications have been reported to have a negative impact on the long-term survival (
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The frequency of postoperative complications of 
 <bold>≥</bold> grade 3 has been reported to be 8.3–12% in previous studies of doublet preoperative chemotherapy (
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). There was a concern that postoperative complications would increase because this study adopted a triplet regimen. However, the actual incidence of grade ≥2 and ≥3 postoperative complications in this study was 23.3 and 6.7%, respectively, and there was no surgical mortality. We hypothesize that in addition to the administration of a low-dose regimen, the volume reduction induced by preoperative chemotherapy contributed to the safety.
