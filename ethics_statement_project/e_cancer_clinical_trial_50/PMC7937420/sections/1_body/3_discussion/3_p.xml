<p>The feasibility of two-course chemotherapy was also controversial in terms of the total dose. In this study, patients received two courses of preoperative DCS therapy. In the KDOG 1001 study, which used the same doses as this study, the overall pRR was 57.5%, but it was higher (69.5%) in patients who received four courses (

This may indicate that patients who had already shown a histological response by the second course received four courses of chemotherapy. Meanwhile, Aoyama etÂ al. (

Considering these reports, more careful discussion is needed to increase the number of courses of preoperative chemotherapy.
