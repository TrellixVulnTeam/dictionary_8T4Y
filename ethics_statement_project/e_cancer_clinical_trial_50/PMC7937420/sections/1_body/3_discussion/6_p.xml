<p>The present study was associated with some limitations. First, this was a single-arm phase II study and evaluated only early endpoints, including the pathological response, chemotherapy-related toxicities, and surgical results. Second, the pRR was determined by the pathologist at each institution and there was no central assessment. Third, the low incidence of postoperative complications may reflect the difficulty of the surgical procedure rather than the impact of the intensity of preoperative chemotherapy. In this study, none of the patients required extended lymph node dissection, even though patients with marginally resectable cancer were included.</p>
