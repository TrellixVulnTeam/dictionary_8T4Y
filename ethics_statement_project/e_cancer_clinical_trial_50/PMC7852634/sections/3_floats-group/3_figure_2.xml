   <bold>Median stent patency times and survival time for the combined group.</bold> A: The survival curve showed that the median stent patency time in the combined group was 9.000 ± 1.414 mo (95% confidence interval (CI): 6.228-11.772 mo), the control group was 6.000 ± 0.267 mo (95%CI: 5.476-6.524 mo), and there was a significant difference (
