 <sup>125</sup>I seeds are new micro-low-dose-rate particle sources developed in recent years with an effective irradiation radius of 15-20 mm, half-life of 59.43 d, and energy of 27.4 keV for X rays and 35.5keV for R rays. Low dose rate and continuous irradiation lead to high dose within the target, resulting in a strong targeted killing effect on tumor cells by destroying DNA double strands of tumor cells and reducing their ability to proliferate without significantly affecting surrounding normal tissues. Because of these advantages, 
 <sup>125</sup>I seed implantation has achieved good results in the treatment of various solid malignancies in recent years.
