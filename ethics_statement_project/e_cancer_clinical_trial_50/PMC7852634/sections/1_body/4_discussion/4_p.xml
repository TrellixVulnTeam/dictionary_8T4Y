<p>Subsequently, Zhu

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] developed a biliary stent carrying 
 <sup>125</sup>I seeds and placed the biliary stent into 12 patients with malignant obstructive jaundice. They showed that radioactive particle stents were superior to traditional bare stents. However, because the stent was divided into a jacket and an inner stent carrying particles, the inner diameter of the stent for drainage was reduced, and the narrowing of the stent inevitably affected bile drainage and stent patency time[
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Additionally, other researchers inserted the 
 <sup>125</sup>I seed strands between the stent and bile duct wall, and the stent patency time and patient survival also improved[
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The 
 <sup>125</sup>I seed strands are fixed and stable, and the quality of life can be significantly improved without carrying an external drainage tube for a long time. We also used this approach with a satisfactory outcome and quality of life was significantly improved. However, all of the aforementioned studies focused on the stenosis caused by existing tumors and placed 
 <sup>125</sup>I seeds in the middle of the stent, ignoring both ends of the stent.
