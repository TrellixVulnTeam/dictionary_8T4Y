<p>Based on the inhibitory effect of 
 <sup>125</sup>I seeds on tumor and granulation tissues, we extended the coverage of 
 <sup>125</sup>I seed strands to both ends of the biliary stent to prevent reobstruction at either end. Our results showed that the survival time of the combined group reached 11.0 ± 1.4 mo, which is longer than that from the Zhu

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] study (median survival time 7.4 mo). The stent patency time reached 9.0 ± 1.4 mo, which was significantly better than that reported by Zhu

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] (stent patency time and median survival time of 194 d)[
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A few factors may have contributed to the improved outcomes in our study. Firstly, the extended 
 <sup>125</sup>I seed strand played a role in preventing obstruction at both ends of the stent. Secondly, the diameter of our stent was 10 mm. Some studies have shown that the larger the diameter of the stent, the longer the restenosis time appears to be[

Thirdly, if there was biliary tract infection, we performed conventional percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage before biliary stent placement to reduce biliary edema and control infection. When the biliary stent was implanted, the catheter was first used to drain the accumulated viscous bile, and normal saline was used to wash out the remaining bile.
