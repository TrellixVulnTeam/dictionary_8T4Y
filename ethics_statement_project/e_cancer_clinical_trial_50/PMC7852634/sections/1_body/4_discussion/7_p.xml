<p>The stent was placed after bile drainage, which seemed to prolong stent patency time, presumably because thick bile can rapidly cause reobstruction of the stent[
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Our study also found that the type of obstruction and number of stents were independent risk factors that affected prognosis. The higher the location of the obstruction, the more and thinner the bile duct branches would be. Because left and right hepatic ducts are disconnected, bilateral stents are required. One stent can only resolve one obstruction. If there are more than two biliary obstructions, then the stents cannot resolve all the obstructions. Therefore, multibranch biliary obstruction has a generally poor bilirubin declining effect, which directly affects liver function and prognosis.
