Therefore, prevention of restenosis after stenting has been a hot topic for clinical research and investigation in recent years and has included the study of covered and drug-eluting stents. Covered stents are prone to displacement, and stent displacement tends to increase the incidence of cholecystitis and pancreatitis. These two approaches have not achieved satisfactory clinical outcomes[
