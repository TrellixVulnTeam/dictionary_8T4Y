 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] first implanted 
 <sup>125</sup>I seeds into porcine bile duct. They demonstrated that 
 <sup>125</sup>I seeds were safe and did not cause serious damage to the bile duct. There are also reports that biliary stents combined with 
 <sup>125</sup>I seed strands for patients with malignant obstructive jaundice. Due to the killing effect of 
 <sup>125</sup>I seeds on tumor tissues, they can increase stent patency time and prolong survival[

 <sup>125</sup>I seed strands into biliary stenosis through an external drainage tube and then removed the drainage tube and 
 <sup>125</sup>I seed strands 2 mo later. This approach also improved the stent patency time and survival of patients compared with traditional stents[

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], but the drainage tube was unstable due to respiratory movement and other daily activities and affected quality of life. Because the drainage tube and 
 <sup>125</sup>I seed strands were removed after 2 mo, the 
 <sup>125</sup>I seed strands had a shorter duration of action, which inevitably affected treatment efficacy.
