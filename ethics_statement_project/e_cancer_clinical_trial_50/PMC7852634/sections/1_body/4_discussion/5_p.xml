<p>Tumor growth will occur along the outside of the stent, causing obstruction at both ends of the stent as reported previously[

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] found that after esophageal stent implantation, both ends were prone to reocclusion in animal experiments and clinical practice. Pathological examination revealed that the obstruction was mainly caused by overgrown tumor tissue and hyperplastic granulation tissue. After biliary stenting, granulation tissue hyperplasia may also occur with local frictional stimulation between both ends of the stent and the biliary tract[

 <sup>125</sup>I seeds destroy double-stranded DNA of tumor cells and stop tumor proliferation. Additionally, it has been found that radioactive stents increase the activity of the caspase-3 gene through Î³ rays, promoting canine bile duct smooth muscle cell apoptosis, and therefore inhibiting canine bile duct stenosis in animal experiments[
