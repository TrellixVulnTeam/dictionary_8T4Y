<p>Malignant obstructive jaundice is caused by cholangiocarcinoma or peribiliary malignant tumor invasion and compression; onset of symptoms is generally insidious with only 10%-20% of patients indicated for surgical resection. The 3-year survival rate is &lt; 50%[

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For patients who are not indicated for or unwilling to undergo surgery, biliary stent placement can relieve biliary obstruction, improve liver function and quality of life, and prolong survival[

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, restenosis after a biliary stent may significantly worsen prognosis and remains a clinical challenge. The main causes of restenosis include tumor growth, cholestatic accumulation, and granulation tissue hyperplasia. In recent years, reports of biliary stents combined with iodine-125 (
 <sup>125</sup>I) seed implantation seemed to prolong stent patency time and improved patient survival[
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, most attempts to relieve stenosis caused by tumors utilized a technique of placing the 
 <sup>125</sup>I seed in the middle of the stent while ignoring both ends. Because of overgrowth of the tumor and fibrous granulation tissue hyperplasia caused by frictional stimulation between the two ends of the stent and the bile duct wall, both ends of the stent can be reobstructed[

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, measures to prevent reobstruction may provide a greater benefit to patients. In this study, we evaluated extending the 
 <sup>125</sup>I seed strand across the entire length of the stent.
