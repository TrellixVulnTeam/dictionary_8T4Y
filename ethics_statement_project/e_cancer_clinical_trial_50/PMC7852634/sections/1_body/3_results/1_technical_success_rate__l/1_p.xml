<p>Both groups of patients were successfully implanted with biliary stents or 
 <sup>125</sup>I seed strand, and the technical success rate was 100%. Liver function was significantly improved in both groups 5 d after surgery (total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase decreased significantly in all patients; the 
 <italic>P </italic>values were less than 0.05). There was no significant difference in preoperative or postoperative indexes between the two groups for changes in total bilirubin (
 <italic>P </italic>= 0.147), direct bilirubin (
 <italic>P </italic>= 0.448), alanine aminotransferase (
 <italic>P </italic>= 0.120), and aspartate aminotransferase (
 <italic>P </italic>= 0.387) (Table
