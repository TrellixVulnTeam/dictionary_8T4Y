<p>The mean and median stent patency times for the combined group were 9.5 ± 0.6 mo [95% confidence interval (CI): 8.3-10.7 mo] and 9.0 ± 1.4 mo (95%CI: 6.3-11.8 mo), respectively. For the control group, they were 5.8 ± 0.2 mo (95%CI: 5.4-6.3 mo) and 6.0 ± 0.3 mo (95%CI: 5.5-6.5 mo), respectively. There was a significant difference between the two groups (
