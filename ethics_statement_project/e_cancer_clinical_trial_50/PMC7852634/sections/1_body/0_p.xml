 <bold>Core Tip: </bold>For patients who are unable to undergo surgery, biliary stent placement can relieve biliary obstruction and prolong survival. However, previous studies relieved stenosis caused by an existing tumor lesion by placing an iodine-125 seed in the middle of the stent while ignoring both ends. Both ends of the stent can be reobstructed. We observed that extending the iodine-125 seed strand along the length of the stent produced a safe and effective result in malignant obstructive jaundice.
