<p>Under the guidance of ultrasound and digital subtraction angiography, an 18G needle was used to puncture the intrahepatic dilated bile duct. A guide wire was introduced in place of the puncture needle core, and the puncture needle sheath was pulled out. An 8F long arterial sheath was introduced through the guide wire, and two guide wires were introduced through the long arterial sheath after withdrawing the core of the arterial sheath. After removing the arterial sheath, the stent conveyor was placed along one of the guide wires. A customized 
 <sup>125</sup>I seed strand was placed along an 8F long arterial sheath that was introduced along the other guide wire (Figure

 <sup>125</sup>I seeds were placed in a 4F plastic tube 
 <italic>via</italic> a seed gun, and both ends were heated and then clamped shut (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). The number of 
 <sup>125</sup>I seeds was calculated by: N = L/4.5 + 2 (L = stent length). Only simple stents were placed in the control group. After successful stenting and 
 <sup>125</sup>I seed strand implantation, an external drainage tube was placed through the guide wire. After 2 mo, imaging examination was performed to confirm that the stent was unobstructed before the drainage tube was removed.
