<p>Based on previous reports, the median survival time after traditional biliary stent implantation is 3-8 mo[
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We assumed median survival time of 3 mo in the control group and 8 mo in the combined group. The Î± value was 0.05 (unilateral test), the power was 0.9, and we needed 30 cases in each group for the sample size.
