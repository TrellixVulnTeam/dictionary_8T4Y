<p>Between January 2016 and June 2018, 67 patients with malignant obstructive jaundice were treated in our center. All patients underwent enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging and were tested for biochemical and cancer markers. Twelve patients underwent pathological examination before surgery. All patients were diagnosed with malignant obstructive jaundice. Envelopes were randomly assigned to the simple stent (control) group and the biliary stent combined with 
 <sup>125</sup>I seed strand treatment (combined) group according to a 1:1 ratio. There were 35 patients in the control group and 32 in the combined group (one patient in the combined group was transferred to the control group for economic reasons). There were 35 patients with pancreatic cancer (21 in the control group and 14 in the combined group); 19 patients with gallbladder cancer and cholangiocarcinoma (8 in the control group and 11 in the combined group); and 13 patients with lymph node metastasis from digestive malignant tumors (6 in the control group and 7 in the combined group). The statistician was blinded to group assignment. The general clinical characteristics of the two groups of patients are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The differences between the two groups were not significant.
