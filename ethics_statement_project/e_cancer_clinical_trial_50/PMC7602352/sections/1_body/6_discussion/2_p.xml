<p id="Par97">SRS which is often given in preference over WBRT in limited brain metastases (≤3–4 lesions) has shown better learning and memory preservation in several randomised trials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In patients with &gt; 4 brain lesions, WBRT remains the standard of care although the role of SRS is fast emerging. A prospective observational study and a large retrospective multi-institutional study have shown that the total number of brain metastases (up to 15 lesions) treated with SRS did not seem to affect the survival outcome and could be considered instead of WBRT [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Despite this, there remains some controversy in giving SRS for multiple brain metastases. One would expect that with more brain metastases, the risk of brain micrometastases and intracranial failure is higher and thus giving SRS instead of WBRT would mean the need for early salvage treatment thus negating the clinical benefit [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The previous SRS trials also did not perform comparisons against newer neurocognitive protecting strategies like HA-WBRT and the use of neuroprotective agents like memantine. Several randomised phase III trials are thus underway that will hopefully provide further clarity on the role of SRS in the setting of multiple brain metastases.
