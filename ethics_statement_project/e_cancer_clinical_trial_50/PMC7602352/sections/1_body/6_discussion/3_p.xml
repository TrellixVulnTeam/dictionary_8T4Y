<p id="Par98">The NRG-CC001 trial which proved the benefit of HA-WBRT over WBRT had a poor intracranial PFS of 5.0â€‰months [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This was not surprising, given the inherent low doses utilised in standard HA-WBRT. Several studies have shown that higher doses to target lesions could improve on local control rates and potentially reduce intracranial failure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In turn, improving intracranial control could possibly result in improved performance status and reduced neurological death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It would thus seem reasonable to consider giving tumours a simultaneous higher dose during HA-WBRT using HA-SIB-WBRT. The preliminary evidence for this has been promising. However, there is still a lack of high-level evidence on the benefit and safety it has over standard HA-WBRT. This trial thus sets out to explore the magnitude of these benefits including control rates, toxicities, survival outcomes, cognition and other PROMs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only prospective, randomised trial comparing HA-WBRT against HA-SIB-WBRT. We, therefore, believe that this trial is significant as it will provide the evidence required to support its use.
