<p id="Par86">Cognitive test (HVLT-R and CTT) scores will be standardised based on published norms: (Patient value – Published-norm mean value) ÷ Published-norm standard deviation value. Cognitive deterioration will be defined as a decline of at least 1 SD in score from baseline. FACT-BR scores will be transformed to a 0- to 100- point scale. A 10-point decrease will be considered clinically significant. Deterioration in functional independence will be defined as a decline of at least 10% in the Barthel ADL index from baseline.</p>
