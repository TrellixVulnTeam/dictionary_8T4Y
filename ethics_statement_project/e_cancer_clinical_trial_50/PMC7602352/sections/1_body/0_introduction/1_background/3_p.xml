<p id="Par38">A recent phase 3 trial, NRG-CC001, randomised 518 patients to Hippocampal avoidance-WBRT (HA-WBRT) against standard WBRT. Cognitive endpoints were measured using a test battery of Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R), Controlled Oral Word Association, and Trail Making Test (TMT) Part A &amp; B. At a median follow-up for alive patients of 7.9 months, a significant reduction in cognitive failure risk was noted (HR, 0.76; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.03) in the HA-WBRT arm. This difference was most significant in the 4-month TMT Part B scores and the 6-month HVLT-R score. The median overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) did not differ and there was no increase in hippocampal relapses. However notably, OS and PFS in the HA-WBRT arm were poor at 6.3 months and 5.0 months respectively [
