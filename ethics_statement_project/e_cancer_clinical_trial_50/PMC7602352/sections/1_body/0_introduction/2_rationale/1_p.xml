<p id="Par40">In the landmark RTOG 95â€“08 trial which compared an SRS boost vs. no boost in patients undergoing WBRT, the patients in the boost arm had improved local control rates, better functional autonomy and reduced steroid need with few toxicities [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. With current dose-painting radiotherapy planning techniques, we are now able to deliver a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) dose to the lesions while giving HA-WBRT, a technique abbreviated as HA-SIB-WBRT or HA-WBRT+SIB.
