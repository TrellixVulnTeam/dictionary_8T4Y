<p id="Par41">Several single-arm prospective studies looked at the use of WBRT+SIB or HA-SIB-WBRT in variable patient cohorts with SIB doses of 40–52.5Gy in 10–15 fractions [

In a propensity score-matched comparison against WBRT, Popp et al. reported significantly improved local tumour control rates, intracranial PFS, reduction in neurological deaths and even better OS [
