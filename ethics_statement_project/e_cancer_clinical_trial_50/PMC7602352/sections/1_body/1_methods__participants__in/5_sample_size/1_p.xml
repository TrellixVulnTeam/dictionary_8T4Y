<p id="Par79">Assuming a 6-month target lesion control rate of 50% in the HA-WBRT arm, we will need 60 subjects (30 per arm) to detect a hazard ratio of 0.27 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] between the 2 arms with 80% power using a 2-sided log-rank test at 5% significance level. A hazard ratio of 0.27 means the 6-month target lesion control rate in the HA-SIB-WBRT arm is expected to be 83%. These calculations assume that subjects will be followed up till target lesion progression, or for a minimum of 6â€‰months. Assuming a 40% non-evaluable rate, an estimated total sample size of 100 subjects will be required.
