<p id="Par78">Cognitive function, ADL and QoL will be assessed using patient-directed questionnaires that have been validated, available in local languages and used in the trials mentioned earlier for ease of comparison. These tests are optional but encouraged for all patients and will be conducted by a trained physician or clinical research associate at specified time points (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The total duration of the combined test is estimated to be 30 min. In the analysis of cognitive function, ADL and QoL, each patient will serve as his/her own control. The test results at each follow-up (post-treatment) time point will be compared to the baseline (pre-treatment) test result.
