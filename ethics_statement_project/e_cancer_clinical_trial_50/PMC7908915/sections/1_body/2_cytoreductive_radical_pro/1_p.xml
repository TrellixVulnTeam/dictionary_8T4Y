<p>Historical data from the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) 8894 trial randomising 1286 men with metastatic disease to bilateral orchidectomy with placebo or flutamide demonstrated that a subgroup of men who underwent previous radical prostatectomy had a significantly reduced risk of death (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.80).
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Building on this, numerous retrospective series and registry data (eg, Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)) have reported improved OS and CSS in men who undergo cytoreductive radical prostatectomy with low-burden or predominantly osseous disease.
