<p>At present, prospective evidence is limited to a 61-patient case–control study conducted by Heidenreich and colleagues.
 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Performed in men with &lt;4 metastases and no visceral or extensive lymph node metastases, with a serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level &lt;1.0 ng/mL after neoadjuvant ADT, CRP and extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) led to a 12.1-month improvement in PFS compared with the control arm ADT alone (38.6 months vs 26.5 months; p=0.0032).
 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> There were no reported grade 4 or 5 Clavien-Dindo classification complications within this study, confirming the surgical feasibility reported in previous retrospective studies.
