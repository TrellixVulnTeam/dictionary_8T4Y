<p>IP2-ATLANTA is a multicentre, phase II, randomised controlled trial. The study will provide level I evidence on oncological outcomes from prostate MIAT or radical therapy, in combination with MDT, against SOC treatment alone, in men with newly diagnosed hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer. If either intervention arm is proven to provide significant oncological benefit, this will have wide-reaching implications on the current SOC paradigm.</p>
