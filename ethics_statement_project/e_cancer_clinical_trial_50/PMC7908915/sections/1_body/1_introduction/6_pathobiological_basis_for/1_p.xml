<p>The pathobiological basis underpinning local cytoreductive and MDT in prostate cancer is not fully delineated.
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Local prostate cytoreduction is thought to primarily impact on tumour-derived factors such as cytokines, chemokines and microRNAs.
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> In particular, prostate tumour cell shedding and dissemination has been shown to occur earlier, with the detection of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) in blood and disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) in bone marrow of patients staged as non-metastatic on conventional imaging (ie, bone scintigraphy).
