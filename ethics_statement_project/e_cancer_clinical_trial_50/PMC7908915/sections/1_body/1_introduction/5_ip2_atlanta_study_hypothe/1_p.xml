<p>We hypothesise that men with metastatic disease who undergo treatment of the local tumour in the form of either radical therapy (cytoreductive radical prostatectomy (CRP) or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT)), or minimally invasive ablative therapy (MIAT), combined with metastases-directed therapy (MDT), will improve PFS compared with patients who receive standard of treatment alone.</p>
