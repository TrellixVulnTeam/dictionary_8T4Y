<p>The Systemic Therapy in Advancing Or Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Evaluation Of Drug Efficacy (STAMPEDE) collaborators explored the role of local prostate radiotherapy in 2061 men with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer receiving ADT, with 18% also receiving docetaxel.
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Although no OS advantage was demonstrated (HR 0.92 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.06); p=0.27) in all burden metastatic disease, radiotherapy did improve failure-free survival (HR 0.76 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.84); p&lt;0.0001).
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Nevertheless, in the prespecified subgroup of men with the CHAARTED definition of low burden disease, a significant OS was reported (3-year OS 81% vs 73%, HR 0.68 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.90); p=0.007). As with any subgroup analyses, these data need to be interpreted cautiously. Furthermore, radiotherapy treatment (weekly or daily) had acceptable side effects with only a 5% grade 3â€“4 adverse event rate.
