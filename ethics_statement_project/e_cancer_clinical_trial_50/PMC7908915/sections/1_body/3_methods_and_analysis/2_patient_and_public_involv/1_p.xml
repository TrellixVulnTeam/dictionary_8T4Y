<p>A patient-involvement focus group was held with six patients who had advanced or metastatic prostate cancer to determine initial patient acceptability and gauge important opinions on the proposed amendment and study design. Four patients had previously received radiotherapy as either their primary or secondary treatment. Comments from the group discussion were recorded along with anonymous questionnaires, which the patients returned, by post after the meeting. Two patient and public involvement representatives were present during the HRA REC assessment. They will continue to be involved throughout the duration of the trial with the Trial Management Group and other patients not involved in the direct management of the study will be on the independent Trials Steering Committee.</p>
