<p>Follow-up imaging to determine response from treatment on primary and metastatic disease will not be protocolled but we recommend imaging to take place when there is suspicion of progression, such as patients with a rising PSA (ie, biochemical failure). The appropriate imaging will be chosen as per the local hospital resources and policies. We envisage that the majority will perform a combination of a prostate MRI, bone scintigraphy, PET-CT/MRI, whole body MRI or CT chest/abdomen/pelvis.</p>
