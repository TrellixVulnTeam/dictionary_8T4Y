<p>In men with low-burden disease in both intervention arms 1 and 2, MDT may be used but intent-to-use MDT is to be declared prior to randomisation. In the case of a metastatic recurrence after MDT, a re-treatment with MDT would be allowed if there were new metastatic areas/locations. The imaging reporting of metastases as well as doses and protocol for MDT will be defined and determined by the Imaging Reporting SOP and Metastases-Directed Therapy SOP.</p>
