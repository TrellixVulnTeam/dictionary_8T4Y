<p>All men diagnosed with prostate cancer who go to a multidisciplinary team meeting or a tumour board, as well as any man meeting the eligibility criteria prior to tumour board discussion, will be identified for screening. Members of the tumour board will identify patients suitable for IP2-ATLANTA. The treating clinicians will mention the study and then the local research nurses/fellows, clinical trial coordinators, clinical trial practitioners or the treating clinicians will then approach the patients if they are interested. A Patient Information Sheet (PIS) will be given, or if agreed, emailed or posted out to the patient. Those patients already aware of the diagnosis can be approached by telephone to enquire as to their interest in the study so that a PIS can be then be sent out by email or post prior to a clinical visit. Patients will be given as much time as they need to read the PIS before consenting to participate (with a minimum of 24 hours).</p>
