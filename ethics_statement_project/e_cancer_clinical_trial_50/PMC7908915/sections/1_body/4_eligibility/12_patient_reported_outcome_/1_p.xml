<p>The European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), Core Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (QLQ-C30), with prostate-specific, fatigue, elderly, general and bone metastases modules, International Prostatic Symptoms Score (IPSS), The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Bowel and Bladder (EPIC) and International Index of Erectile Function 5 (IIEF15) will be used. The EuroQol (EQ-5D-5L) will be used in the study as a generic measure of health-related quality of life which can be linked to public preferences. These data will be used to calculate quality-adjusted life-years as part of a future health economic evaluation. Patients agreeing to return questionnaires on quality of life will continue to complete quality of life data for 4 years after enrolment.</p>
