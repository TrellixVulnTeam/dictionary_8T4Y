<p>While discussing the intervention arms, we should also consider the impact that SOC systemic treatment may have on downstaging the local tumour. As the SOC systemic treatment would be administered prior to any local MIAT or CRP/EBRT in the intervention arms 1 and 2, an attempt at reclassifying the residual disease with a prostate MRI and biopsies would be pragmatic. This is to prevent patients from developing adverse events from unnecessary local treatment when they have no evidence of residual disease. Patients with positive post-SOC biopsies would then receive the local treatment as outlined below. Randomisation would occur at enrolment with planned intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses.</p>
