<p>Biopsies at 6–9 months from initiation of SOC systemic therapy are part of the protocol during the embedded feasibility pilot. As we currently do not know the significance of residual disease after SOC systemic therapy, even if determined to be low volume and low grade, all patients with positive biopsies will be offered local treatment as per randomisation. The pilot stage would obtain a point estimate of the magnitude of this response and also patient acceptability of a post-systemic therapy prostate biopsy.
