<p>We are seeking to determine whether the randomisation of men with metastatic disease is feasible and whether men are compliant to the therapy following randomisation. We aim to approach 80 patients from up to 17 centres in the UK over a 6-month period to allow us to estimate a 33% recruitment rate with 95% CI width of approximately ±10 percentage points.</p>
