<p>The study will have 80% power to detect a treatment difference with an HR 0.7 in favour of any of the intervention arms compared with the control at a two-sided 5.0% significance level. This is based on the assumption that the accrual period will be uniform over 24 months, that the follow-up period will be 24 months and that the median PFS is 37 months. This calculation may be adjusted depending on the compliance rate assessed during the feasibility stage. The overall sample size will be 918 participants considering a 5% loss to follow-up (291 participants per group, 873 participants for three arms). This will allow the detection of an effect size of 9.2% increase in PFS at 24 months.</p>
