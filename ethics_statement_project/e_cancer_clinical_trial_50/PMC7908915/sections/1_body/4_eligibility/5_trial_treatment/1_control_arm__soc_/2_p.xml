<p>If radiotherapy is planned for local disease in men randomised to the SOC arm with low-volume metastases, then this will be declared prior to randomisation by the treating clinician. For men with low burden disease, external beam prostate radiotherapy will be permitted and defined by the Local Radiotherapy Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) which reflects NHS clinically commissioned guidelines.
 <xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> The use of PLNRT and/or MDT will not be permitted in the control arm. Palliative prostate radiotherapy for locoregional symptom control in men with high burden (&gt;/=4) metastases will be permitted as per local clinical practice.
