<p>The surgical technique is at the discretion and expertise of the surgical team but will reflect current UK surgical practice, laid down in the cytoreductive radical prostatectomy SOP. Trial surgeons must meet minimum case volume and optimal complication outcomes prior to operating in this trial. Further, they must receive peer approval from the IP2-ATLANTA Surgeons Quality Assurance Board. For patients who are undergoing prostatectomy, no local prostate radiotherapy will be given as part of the intervention. Radiotherapy can be given subsequently for palliative reasons.</p>
