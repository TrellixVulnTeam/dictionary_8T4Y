In this trial, women aged 18&#x02013;25&#x02009;years were randomized (1:1) to receive HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine(<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3026) or aluminum hydroxide (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3025) as a placebo at months 0, 1 and 6. Enrolment in this trial started in October 2008 and follow-up lasted for 72&#x02009;months (14 visits). The trial was conducted according to The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) and the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The study protocol and informed consent were approved by the ethics committees of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Jiangsu Province and the Cancer Foundation of China. The trial was registered at the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (number NCT00779766) and adhered to CONSORT guidelines. Before the study-specific procedures, written informed consent was obtained from each participant. The further details of the trial have been described in previous published papers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Briefly, women after excision treatment were followed up by collecting cervical exfoliated cell samples in gynecologic physical examination at each study visit. The cervical samples were evaluated by HPV DNA PCR testing and cytology. For all cytology diagnoses of Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASCUS), the central laboratory had additionally performed HC2 High-Risk HPV DNA Test&#x02122; (Qiagen Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) on residual PreservCyt&#x000ae; specimen. The subjects were referred to colposcopy if they had cytology ASCUS with HPV positive results (by HC2 HPV DNA test), or cytology low-grade squamous cell intraepithelial lesion or worse (LSIL+) independent of HPV DNA results.</p><p id="Par25">In this post-hoc analysis, we intend to explore the impact of HPV vaccination on women after excision treatment by focusing on intent-to-treat participants who received at least one dose of vaccine or placebo. Three level of analysis would be conducted in focusing on HPV infection (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>: analytical cohort 1), LSIL analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>: analytical cohort 2) and recurrence of precancerous lesions, respectively. In the HPV infection-level analysis, each infection instead of a woman was considered as the unit of analysis to estimate the incidence rate of HPV16/18 (vaccine-specific types), HPV31/33/45(cross-protective types) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], 14 HR-HPV (any of the 14 high-risk HPV types) and 11 LR-HPV (any of the 11 low-risk HPV types) infection. Persistent infection was defined as at least two positive HPV DNA PCR assays for the same viral genotype with no negative DNA sample between the two positive DNA samples, over an interval of 6&#x02009;months or longer. Newly acquired infection (new infection) was defined as the positive detection by PCR of an episode of infection by HPV type(s) in a subject who was negative at excision treatment visit for the considered HPV type(s). Given the high efficacy of the HPV-16/18 vaccine against new infections, we also conducted analysis restricted to newly detected infection after treatment.

The women (Case 4: Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) who developed CIN2 in the placebo group was HPV16, 31, 33 DNA positive, with HSIL predicted by cytology at gynecological examination at visit3 (6&#x02009;month). She underwent cold knife conization treatment at visit 3(6&#x02009;months) and CIN3 was diagnosed by histology; the margins of the excisional material were disease-free. After 6 months she had cytological ASCH (atypical squamous cell, but cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) results and was referred to colposcopy. CIN2 was diagnosed on punch biopsy and HPV genotyping on cervical tissue sample revealed HPV31, 33 positive. The one VAIN2 case in the vaccine group (Case 2: Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) occurred in a woman who was HPV16 DNA positive, with a cytology HSIL result at baseline (visit1). She underwent LEEP treatment at baseline (visit1) and CIN3 was diagnosed by histology; the margins of the excisional material were disease-free. At 12&#x02009;months, she had ASCUS on cytology and was referred to colposcopy. VAIN2 was diagnosed on punch biopsy and HPV genotyping on cervical tissue sample revealed HPV16 positive.

In this study, vaccination failed to lead to viral faster clearance or have any effect on persistent HPV infection. However, the available evidence suggested that the vaccine may still benefit women after excisional treatment for cervical disease by &#x0201c;primary prophylactic&#x0201d; effect, which protects women from new infection after treatment.</p><p id="Par37">Former studies have indicated that the prophylactic HPV vaccines have the possibility in benefiting post-treatment women. The post-hoc analysis of the PApilloma TRIal against Cancer In young Adults (PATRICIA) showed that efficacy of the HPV 16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine post-surgery (60&#x02009;days or more) for the original lesion was 88.2% against CIN2+ and 42.6% against CIN1+ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, the analysis from a large randomized clinical trial in Costa Rica indicated significant vaccine efficacy against the development of new infection associated with HPV31/33/45 and any of the 12 HR-HPV types. Vaccine efficacy against HPV16/18 new infection was positive but didn&#x02019;t reach statistical significance, which was consistent with our analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Additionally, we found that HPV 16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccination could protect against any of the 14 HR-HPV infection and prevent its new infection after treatment. From our analysis, no significant difference for the accumulative clearance and persistent rate of HPV infection between two groups was identified. Women who underwent surgery for the first cervical lesions after receiving the vaccine may benefit from the vaccination, which could be attributed to the protect effects against new infections after treatment. Besides, a non-randomized observational study also demonstrated that quadrivalent vaccination after treatment of CIN2&#x02013;3 significantly reduced the risk of recurrence in patients related to HPV16/18, which suggested that a benefit effect in offering HPV vaccination to women post CIN treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">The women who were treated due to HPV-related disease were at high risk for developing subsequent HPV related disease. The persistent or recurrent rate of CIN2+ after excisional treatment was reported as 4%&#x02009;~&#x02009;18% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A meta-analysis revealed that the risk of residual or recurrent CIN2+ was significantly increased among women with positive excision margins compared to those with negative margins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The recurrence of histologically proven CIN2+ after the treatment for the first high-grade cervical lesion was influenced by many factors including initial diagnosis, age, treatment type and the infection status of original excisional margins. Another systematic review, reporting the data about newly detected HPV genotypes post-treatment for precancerous cervical lesions, showed the incident detection rate were estimated up to 24% for HR-HPV types at 3-11&#x02009;months after treatment and up to 21% at 12&#x02013;36&#x02009;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These infections were most potentially newly acquired or reactivated from latent infections (i.e. detection of infection formerly present at levels below the cut-off point of the HPV assay). Therefore, potentially, neutralizing antibodies induced by vaccination could bind to virions newly acquired or virions produced by infected cells, reducing spread of an existing infection by restraining the ability of the residual virus to infect new cells and thereby play the protective role among women after excision treatment. Our study corroborated that post-treatment women may benefit from the protection against new infection after treatment. Further studies are needed to confirm the hypothesis whether the vaccine could prevent reactivation of latent infection and reduce spread of an existing infection by restraining the ability of the virus to infect new cells.</p><p id="Par39">The major advantage of our study is that we have detailed information about the margin status of excisional material for each woman treated for the first cervical lesion who subsequently developed lesions after surgery. This made it possible to confirm whether subsequent cervical lesions were associated with HPV genotype infection found in the original lesion. However, there are some limitations in our analysis. The subgroup of women who underwent excision treatment was not a randomized group, so we had limited power to evaluate post-treatment vaccine efficacy. Furthermore, because no any sexual behavior data was collected, we were not able to evaluate the sexual behavior difference between two groups or estimate the effect of vaccination by adjusting the factor. However, a good balance regarding HPV status at enrollment had been achieved between the two arms, which indicated that there may be no significant difference in sexual behavior between the two groups. And we used cytological results as an outcome in the analysis due to not all women after treatment underwent colposcopy, which may have potential bias. Based on previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], cytology showed the higher specificity at the cost of lower sensitivity compared to colposcopy, so women without distinct cytological performance would be missed. Additionally, due to the small number of women who received surgery in clinical trials and the fact that loss of follow-up further reduced sample size included in the analysis, we had limited statistical power. There remains a need for more studies with a larger sample size to further confirm the post-treatment vaccine efficacy against new infections and resultant lesions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par40">Significant vaccine efficacy against new infections after treatment for 14 HR-HPV infection was observed. The nonsignificant effect against new infections associated with HPV-16/18 and cervical lesions (LSIL+ and CIN2+) maybe caused by the limited power with smaller number of women. However, the vaccine may still benefit post-treatment women with the &#x0201c;primary prophylactic&#x0201d; effect. Further research is required in clarifying the effect of using the prophylactic HPV vaccine as therapeutic agents.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>HPV</term><def><p id="Par6">Human Papillomavirus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HR-HPV</term><def><p id="Par7">High Risk Human Papillomavirus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LR-HPV</term><def><p id="Par8">Low Risk Human Papillomavirus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LEEP</term><def><p id="Par9">Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CIN</term><def><p id="Par10">Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IQR</term><def><p id="Par11">Interquartile Range</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CICAMS</term><def><p id="Par12">Cancer Institute of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VE</term><def><p id="Par13">Vaccine Efficacy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAIN</term><def><p id="Par14">Vaginal Intraepithelial Neoplasia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ASCUS</term><def><p id="Par15">Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ASCH</term><def><p id="Par16">Atypical Squamous Cell, but cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AGC</term><def><p id="Par17">Atypical Glandular Cells</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LSIL+</term><def><p id="Par18">Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion or worse</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HSIL+</term><def><p id="Par19">High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion or worse</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p id="Par20">Confidence Interval</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge all the study participants and the staff members of the different sites for their contribution to the clinical trial.
