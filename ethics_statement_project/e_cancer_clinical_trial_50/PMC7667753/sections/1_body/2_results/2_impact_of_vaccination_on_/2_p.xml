<p id="Par32">Then, we evaluated whether the viral clearance rates or HPV persistent infection rates differed by vaccination status. Results were shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. No evidence from this study showed that vaccination led to viral faster clearance or had any effect on the persistent infection rate. The accumulative clearance rates of the vaccine group and placebo group were 88.9, 81.6% for HPV16/18 infection(
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.345), 81.3, 80.0% for HPV31/33/45 infection(
 <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.999), 63.4, 48.7% for 14 HR-HPV infection(
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.062), respectively. No significant difference on the persistent infection rate of HPV16/18(4.4% vs 2.6%,
 <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.999), HPV31/33/45(18.8% vs 10.0%,
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.637),14 HR-HPV (20.7% vs 17.1%,
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.561) was identified between the two groups.
