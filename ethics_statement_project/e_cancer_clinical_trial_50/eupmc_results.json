The hypothesis is based on the observation that the majority of patients in need of intensive care are male, and the connection between androgen receptor signalling and expression of TMPRSS2, an enzyme important for SARS-CoV-2 host cell internalization.<h4>Trial design</h4>Hospitalised COVID-19 patients will be randomised (2:1) to enzalutamide plus standard of care vs. standard of care designed to identify superiority.<h4>Participants</h4>Included participants, men or women above 50 years of age, must be hospitalised for PCR confirmed COVID-19 symptoms and not in need of immediate mechanical ventilation. Major exclusion criteria are breast-feeding or pregnant women, hormonal treatment for prostate or breast cancer, treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, current symptomatic unstable cardiovascular disease (see Additional file 1 for further details). The trial is registered at Ume\u00e5 University Hospital, Region V\u00e4sterbotten, Sweden and 8 hospitals are approved for inclusion in Sweden.<h4>Intervention and comparator</h4>Patients randomised to the treatment arm will be treated orally with 160 mg (4x40 mg) enzalutamide (Xtandi\u00ae) daily, for five consecutive days. The study is not placebo controlled. The comparator is standard of care treatment for patients hospitalised with COVID-19.<h4>Main outcomes</h4>The primary endpoints of the study are (time to) need of mechanical ventilation or discharge from hospital as assessed by a clinical 7-point ordinal scale (up to 30 days after inclusion).<h4>Randomisation</h4>Randomisation was stratified by center and sex. Each strata was randomized separately with block size six with a 2:1 allocation ratio (enzalutamide + \"standard of care\": \"standard of care\"). The randomisation list, with consecutive subject numbers, was generated by an independent statistician using the PROC PLAN procedure of SAS version 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina) BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-label trial.<h4>Numbers to be randomised (sample size)</h4>The trial is designed to have three phases. The first, an exploration phase of 45 participants (30 treatment and 15 control) will focus on safety and includes a more extensive laboratory assessment as well as more frequent safety evaluation. The second prolongation phase, includes the first 100 participants followed by an interim analysis to define the power of the study. The third phase is the continuation of the study up to maximum 600 participants included in total.<h4>Trial status</h4>The current protocol version is COVIDENZA v2.0 as of September 10, 2020.

Oral nutritional supplement is the first choice of nutritional support recommended by current guidelines, which can supplement the lack of energy and protein in patients with esophageal cancer, improve nutritional status and improve the quality of life, but there are few clinical studies. Therefore, the purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effect of oral nutritional supplement therapy on nutritional status and quality of life in patients with esophageal cancer treated undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy.<h4>Methods</h4>This is a prospective randomized controlled trial to study the effects of oral nutritional supplement therapy on nutritional status and quality of life in patients with esophageal cancer undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This study is approved by the Clinical Research Society of our hospital. Patients will be randomly divided into ONS group and traditional diet group.

Oral nutritional supplement is the first choice of nutritional support recommended by current guidelines, which can supplement the lack of energy and protein in patients with esophageal cancer, improve nutritional status and improve the quality of life, but there are few clinical studies. Therefore, the purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effect of oral nutritional supplement therapy on nutritional status and quality of life in patients with esophageal cancer treated undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy.<h4>Methods</h4>This is a prospective randomized controlled trial to study the effects of oral nutritional supplement therapy on nutritional status and quality of life in patients with esophageal cancer undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This study is approved by the Clinical Research Society of our hospital. Patients will be randomly divided into ONS group and traditional diet group. The nutritional status, quality of life score and adverse reactions will be observed before and after radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The data will be analyzed by SPSS 16.0.<h4>Discussion</h4>This study will evaluate the effect of oral nutritional supplement therapy on nutritional status and quality of life of patients with esophageal cancer undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

However, the long treatment duration (i.e. two years or longer) has a high impact on patients and healthcare systems in terms of (severe) toxicity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), resource use, and healthcare costs. While durable tumour responses have been observed and PD-1 blockade is discontinued on an individual basis, no consensus has been reached on the optimal treatment duration. The objective of the Safe Stop trial is to evaluate whether early discontinuation of first-line PD-1 blockade is safe in patients with advanced and metastatic melanoma who achieve a radiological response.<h4>Methods</h4>The Safe Stop trial is a nationwide, multicentre, prospective, single-arm, interventional study in the Netherlands. A total of 200 patients with advanced and metastatic cutaneous melanoma and a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST) v1.1 will be included to early discontinue first-line monotherapy with nivolumab or pembrolizumab. The primary objective is the rate of ongoing responses at 24\u00a0months after discontinuation of PD-1 blockade. Secondary objectives include best overall and duration of response, need and outcome of rechallenge with PD-1 blockade, and changes in (serious) adverse events and HRQoL. The impact of treatment discontinuation on healthcare resource use, productivity losses, and hours of informal care will also be assessed. Results will be compared to those from patients with CR or PR who completed 24\u2009months of treatment with PD-1 blockade and had an ongoing response at treatment discontinuation. It is hypothesised that it is safe to early stop first-line nivolumab or pembrolizumab at confirmed tumour response while improving HRQoL and reducing costs.<h4>Discussion</h4>From a patient, healthcare, and economic perspective, shorter treatment duration is preferred and overtreatment should be prevented. If early discontinuation of first-line PD-1 blockade appears to be safe, early discontinuation of PD-1 blockade may be implemented as the standard of care in a selected group of patients.<h4>Trial registration</h4>The Safe Stop trial has been registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR), Trial NL7293 (old NTR ID: 7502), https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/7293 .

cancer; more patients receive systemic treatment, fewer patients undergo futile surgery, and R0 resection rates are higher, thereby possibly improving overall survival (OS). Two recent randomized trials have suggested benefit of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy over upfront surgery, both including single-agent chemotherapy regimens. Potentially, the multi-agent FOLFIRINOX regimen (5-fluorouracil with leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) may further improve outcomes in the neoadjuvant setting for localized pancreatic cancer, but randomized studies are needed. The PREOPANC-2 trial investigates whether neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX improves OS compared with neoadjuvant gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant gemcitabine in resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer patients.<h4>Methods</h4>This nationwide multicenter phase III randomized controlled trial includes patients with pathologically confirmed resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer with a WHO performance score of 0 or 1. Resectable pancreatic cancer is defined as no arterial and\u2009\u2264\u200990 degrees venous involvement; borderline resectable pancreatic cancer is defined as \u226490 degrees arterial and\u2009\u2264\u2009270 degrees venous involvement without occlusion. Patients receive 8\u2009cycles of neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy followed by surgery without adjuvant treatment (arm A), or 3\u2009cycles of neoadjuvant gemcitabine with hypofractionated radiotherapy (36\u2009Gy in 15 fractions) during the second cycle, followed by surgery and 4\u2009cycles of adjuvant gemcitabine (arm B). The primary endpoint is OS by intention-to-treat. Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, quality of life, resection rate, and R0 resection rate. To detect a hazard ratio of 0.70 with 80% power, 252 events are needed. The number of events is expected to be reached after inclusion of 368 eligible patients assuming an accrual period of 3\u2009years and 1.5\u2009years follow-up.<h4>Discussion</h4>The PREOPANC-2 trial directly compares two neoadjuvant regimens for patients with resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.

Evidence has shown that probiotics have a positive effect on improving gastrointestinal complications and nutritional status of patients with esophageal cancer after surgery, but there is a lack of prospective studies on this topic. We designed this prospective randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of probiotics on gastrointestinal complications and nutritional status in patients with postoperative esophageal cancer.<h4>Methods</h4>This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. It was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of our hospital. 192 patients will be randomly divided into probiotics group and the placebo group in a 1:1 ratio. After operation, probiotics and placebo will be given orally for 8\u200aweeks. The indexes of nutritional status and incidence of digestive tract complications will be recorded and the data will be analyzed by SPSS 18.0 software.<h4>Discussion</h4>This study will evaluate the effect of probiotics on gastrointestinal complications and nutritional status of postoperative patients with esophageal cancer. The results of this study will provide clinical basis for the use of probiotics in postoperative treatment of esophageal cancer.<h4>Trial registration</h4>OSF Registration number: D DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/QHW86.", "affiliation": "The NO.2 Hospital of Baoding Department of Gastroenterology.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Clinical Trial Protocol", "research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": {"grantId": "No. 1951ZF021", "agency": "the Baoding science and technology research and development project", "orderIn": "0"}}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Esophageal Neoplasms", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "MI", "qualifierName": "microbiology", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "SU", "qualifierName": "surgery", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Diseases", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "ET", "qualifierName": "etiology", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "MI", "qualifierName": "microbiology", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "TH", "qualifierName": "therapy", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Malnutrition", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "ET", "qualifierName": "etiology", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "MI", "qualifierName": "microbiology", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "TH", "qualifierName": "therapy", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Postoperative Complications"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Esophagectomy", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "AE", "qualifierName": "adverse effects", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Postoperative Period"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Nutritional Status"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Probiotics", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "TU", "qualifierName": "therapeutic use", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Adult"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Female"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Male"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}]}, "subsetList": {"subset": [{"code": "AIM", "name": "Core clinical journals"}, {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000025138"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7982173"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7982173?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2021-03-29", "dateOfCreation": "2021-03-17", "firstIndexDate": "2021-03-17", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2021-03-25", "dateOfRevision": "2021-04-15", "firstPublicationDate": "2021-03-01"}, "htmllinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7982173", "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Gastrointestinal complications and malnutrition are common problems that affect postoperative rehabilitation and survival of patients with esophageal cancer. Evidence has shown that probiotics have a positive effect on improving gastrointestinal complications and nutritional status of patients with esophageal cancer after surgery, but there is a lack of prospective studies on this topic. We designed this prospective randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of probiotics on gastrointestinal complications and nutritional status in patients with postoperative esophageal cancer.<h4>Methods</h4>This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. It was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of our hospital. 192 patients will be randomly divided into probiotics group and the placebo group in a 1:1 ratio. After operation, probiotics and placebo will be given orally for 8\u200aweeks. The indexes of nutritional status and incidence of digestive tract complications will be recorded and the data will be analyzed by SPSS 18.0 software.<h4>Discussion</h4>This study will evaluate the effect of probiotics on gastrointestinal complications and nutritional status of postoperative patients with esophageal cancer.

demonstrate that, in patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 resulting in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), administration of 120mg/kg of body weight of intravenous Prolastin\u00ae(plasma-purified alpha-1 antitrypsin) reduces circulating plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6). Secondary objectives are to determine the effects of intravenous Prolastin\u00ae on important clinical outcomes including the incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).<h4>Trial design</h4>Phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot trial.<h4>Participants</h4>The study will be conducted in Intensive Care Units in hospitals across Ireland. Patients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-infection, moderate to severe ARDS (meeting Berlin criteria for a diagnosis of ARDS with a PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio <200 mmHg), >18 years of age and requiring invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation. All individuals meeting any of the following exclusion criteria at baseline or during screening will be excluded from study participation: more than 96 hours has elapsed from onset of ARDS; age < 18 years; known to be pregnant or breastfeeding; participation in a clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product (other than antibiotics or antivirals) within 30 days; major trauma in the prior 5 days; presence of any active malignancy (other than nonmelanoma skin cancer) which required treatment within the last year; WHO Class III or IV pulmonary hypertension; pulmonary embolism prior to hospital admission within past 3 months; currently receiving extracorporeal life support (ECLS); chronic kidney disease receiving dialysis; severe chronic liver disease with Child-Pugh score > 12; DNAR (Do Not Attempt Resuscitation) order in place; treatment withdrawal imminent within 24 hours; Prisoners; non-English speaking patients or those who do not adequately understand verbal or written information unless an interpreter is available; IgA deficiency.<h4>Intervention and comparator</h4>Intervention: Either a once weekly intravenous infusion of Prolastin\u00ae at 120mg/kg of body weight for 4 weeks or a single dose of Prolastin\u00ae at 120mg/kg of body weight intravenously followed by once weekly intravenous infusion of an equal volume of 0.9% sodium chloride for a further 3 weeks. Comparator (placebo): An equal volume of 0.9% sodium chloride intravenously once per week for four weeks.<h4>Main outcomes</h4>The primary effectiveness outcome measure is the change in plasma concentration of IL-6 at 7 days as measured by ELISA. Secondary outcomes include: safety and tolerability of Prolastin\u00ae in the respective groups (as defined by the number of SAEs and AEs); PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio; respiratory compliance; sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score; mortality; time on ventilator in days; plasma concentration of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) as measured by nephelometry; plasma concentrations of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10), soluble TNF receptor 1 (sTNFR1, a surrogate marker for TNF-\u03b1) as measured by ELISA; development of shock; acute kidney injury; need for renal replacement therapy; clinical relapse, as defined by the need for readmission to the ICU or a marked decline in PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> or development of shock or mortality following a period of sustained clinical improvement; secondary bacterial pneumonia as defined by the combination of radiographic findings and sputum/airway secretion microscopy and culture.<h4>Randomisation</h4>Following informed consent/assent patients will be randomised. The randomisation lists will be prepared by the study statistician and given to the unblinded trial personnel. However, the statistician will not be exposed to how the planned treatment will be allocated to the treatment codes. Randomisation will be conducted in a 1:1:1 ratio, stratified by site and age.<h4>Blinding (masking)</h4>The investigator, treating physician, other members of the site research team and patients will be blinded to treatment allocation. The clinical trial pharmacy personnel and research nurses will be unblinded to facilitate intervention and placebo preparation. The unblinded individuals will keep the treatment information confidential. The infusion bag will be masked at the time of preparation and will be administered via a masked infusion set to maintain blinding.<h4>Numbers to be randomised (sample size)</h4>A total of 36 patients will be recruited and randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to each of the trial arms.<h4>Trial status</h4>In March 2020, version 1.0 of the trial protocol was submitted to the local research ethics committee (REC), Health Research Consent Declaration Committee (HRCDC) and the Health Products regulatory Authority (HPRA). REC approval was granted on April 1<sup>st</sup> 2020, HPRA approval was granted on April 24<sup>th</sup> 2020 and the HRCDC provided a conditional declaration on April 17<sup>th</sup> 2020. In July 2020 a substantial amendment (version 2.0) was submitted to the REC, HRCDC and HPRA. Protocol changes in this amendment included: the addition of trial sites; extending the duration of the trial to 12 months from 3 months; removal of inclusion criteria requiring the need for vasopressors; amendment of randomisation schedule to stratify by age only and not BMI and sex; correction of grammatical error in relation to infusion duration; to allow for inclusion of subjects who may have been enrolled in a clinical trial involving either antibiotics or anti-virals in the past 30 days; to allow for inclusion of subjects who may be currently enrolled in a clinical trial involving either antibiotics or anti-virals; to remove the need for exclusion based on alpha-1 antitrypsin phenotype; removal of mandatory isoelectric focusing of plasma to confirm Pi*MM status at screening; removal of need for mandatory echocardiogram at screening; amendment on procedures around plasma analysis to reflect that this will be conducted at the central site laboratory (as trial is multi-site and no longer single site); wording amended to reflect that interim analysis of cytokine levels taken at 7 days may be conducted. HRCDC approved version 2.0 on September 14th 2020, and HPRA approved on October 22nd 2020. REC approved the substantial amendment on November 23<sup>rd</sup>. In November 2020, version 3.0 of the trial protocol was submitted to the REC and HPRA. The rationale for this amendment was to allow for patients with moderate to severe ARDS from SARS-CoV-2 with non-invasive ventilation. HPRA approved this amendment on December 1st 2020 and the REC approved the amendment on December 8th 2020. Patient recruitment commenced in April 2020 and the last patient will be recruited to the trial in April 2021. The last visit of the last patient is anticipated to occur in April 2021.

Secondary objectives are to determine the effects of intravenous Prolastin\u00ae on important clinical outcomes including the incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).<h4>Trial design</h4>Phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot trial.<h4>Participants</h4>The study will be conducted in Intensive Care Units in hospitals across Ireland. Patients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-infection, moderate to severe ARDS (meeting Berlin criteria for a diagnosis of ARDS with a PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio <200 mmHg), >18 years of age and requiring invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation. All individuals meeting any of the following exclusion criteria at baseline or during screening will be excluded from study participation: more than 96 hours has elapsed from onset of ARDS; age < 18 years; known to be pregnant or breastfeeding; participation in a clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product (other than antibiotics or antivirals) within 30 days; major trauma in the prior 5 days; presence of any active malignancy (other than nonmelanoma skin cancer) which required treatment within the last year; WHO Class III or IV pulmonary hypertension; pulmonary embolism prior to hospital admission within past 3 months; currently receiving extracorporeal life support (ECLS); chronic kidney disease receiving dialysis; severe chronic liver disease with Child-Pugh score > 12; DNAR (Do Not Attempt Resuscitation) order in place; treatment withdrawal imminent within 24 hours; Prisoners; non-English speaking patients or those who do not adequately understand verbal or written information unless an interpreter is available; IgA deficiency.<h4>Intervention and comparator</h4>Intervention: Either a once weekly intravenous infusion of Prolastin\u00ae at 120mg/kg of body weight for 4 weeks or a single dose of Prolastin\u00ae at 120mg/kg of body weight intravenously followed by once weekly intravenous infusion of an equal volume of 0.9% sodium chloride for a further 3 weeks. Comparator (placebo): An equal volume of 0.9% sodium chloride intravenously once per week for four weeks.<h4>Main outcomes</h4>The primary effectiveness outcome measure is the change in plasma concentration of IL-6 at 7 days as measured by ELISA. Secondary outcomes include: safety and tolerability of Prolastin\u00ae in the respective groups (as defined by the number of SAEs and AEs); PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio; respiratory compliance; sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score; mortality; time on ventilator in days; plasma concentration of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) as measured by nephelometry; plasma concentrations of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10), soluble TNF receptor 1 (sTNFR1, a surrogate marker for TNF-\u03b1) as measured by ELISA; development of shock; acute kidney injury; need for renal replacement therapy; clinical relapse, as defined by the need for readmission to the ICU or a marked decline in PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> or development of shock or mortality following a period of sustained clinical improvement; secondary bacterial pneumonia as defined by the combination of radiographic findings and sputum/airway secretion microscopy and culture.<h4>Randomisation</h4>Following informed consent/assent patients will be randomised. The randomisation lists will be prepared by the study statistician and given to the unblinded trial personnel. However, the statistician will not be exposed to how the planned treatment will be allocated to the treatment codes. Randomisation will be conducted in a 1:1:1 ratio, stratified by site and age.<h4>Blinding (masking)</h4>The investigator, treating physician, other members of the site research team and patients will be blinded to treatment allocation. The clinical trial pharmacy personnel and research nurses will be unblinded to facilitate intervention and placebo preparation. The unblinded individuals will keep the treatment information confidential. The infusion bag will be masked at the time of preparation and will be administered via a masked infusion set to maintain blinding.<h4>Numbers to be randomised (sample size)</h4>A total of 36 patients will be recruited and randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to each of the trial arms.<h4>Trial status</h4>In March 2020, version 1.0 of the trial protocol was submitted to the local research ethics committee (REC), Health Research Consent Declaration Committee (HRCDC) and the Health Products regulatory Authority (HPRA). REC approval was granted on April 1<sup>st</sup> 2020, HPRA approval was granted on April 24<sup>th</sup> 2020 and the HRCDC provided a conditional declaration on April 17<sup>th</sup> 2020. In July 2020 a substantial amendment (version 2.0) was submitted to the REC, HRCDC and HPRA. Protocol changes in this amendment included: the addition of trial sites; extending the duration of the trial to 12 months from 3 months; removal of inclusion criteria requiring the need for vasopressors; amendment of randomisation schedule to stratify by age only and not BMI and sex; correction of grammatical error in relation to infusion duration; to allow for inclusion of subjects who may have been enrolled in a clinical trial involving either antibiotics or anti-virals in the past 30 days; to allow for inclusion of subjects who may be currently enrolled in a clinical trial involving either antibiotics or anti-virals; to remove the need for exclusion based on alpha-1 antitrypsin phenotype; removal of mandatory isoelectric focusing of plasma to confirm Pi*MM status at screening; removal of need for mandatory echocardiogram at screening; amendment on procedures around plasma analysis to reflect that this will be conducted at the central site laboratory (as trial is multi-site and no longer single site); wording amended to reflect that interim analysis of cytokine levels taken at 7 days may be conducted. HRCDC approved version 2.0 on September 14th 2020, and HPRA approved on October 22nd 2020. REC approved the substantial amendment on November 23<sup>rd</sup>. In November 2020, version 3.0 of the trial protocol was submitted to the REC and HPRA. The rationale for this amendment was to allow for patients with moderate to severe ARDS from SARS-CoV-2 with non-invasive ventilation. HPRA approved this amendment on December 1st 2020 and the REC approved the amendment on December 8th 2020. Patient recruitment commenced in April 2020 and the last patient will be recruited to the trial in April 2021. The last visit of the last patient is anticipated to occur in April 2021. At time of writing, patient recruitment is now complete, however follow-up patient visits and data collection are ongoing.<h4>Trial registration</h4>EudraCT 2020-001391-15 (Registered 31 Mar 2020).<h4>Full protocol</h4>The full protocol (version 3.0 23.11.2020) is attached as an additional file accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1).

systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer. Recently, studies showed that cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor, when added to endocrine therapy, had improved the outcomes of patients with advanced ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer. However, the disease often progresses following a period of treatment response. In a subset of patients, disease progression may occur at limited sites, i.e., oligoprogressive disease (OPD). In the past few years, stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) has emerged as a safe and effective treatment for advanced cancer when delivered to limited metastatic sites. Hence, it is worth investigating the role of SRT in the setting of oligoprogressive breast cancer.<h4>Method</h4>AVATAR is a multicentre phase II registry trial of SRT with endocrine therapy and CDK 4/6 inhibitor for the management of advanced ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer. The study aims to enrol 32 patients with OPD limited to 5 lesions. The primary endpoint of the study is time to change systemic therapy measured from the commencement of SRT to change in systemic therapy. Secondary objectives include overall survival, progression free survival and treatment related toxicity. The exploratory objective is to describe the time to change in systemic therapy by the site (bone only vs. non-bone lesions) and number (1 vs. >\u20091) of OPD.<h4>Discussion</h4>This study aims to explore the effect of SRT in maximising the benefit of systemic therapy in patients with oligoprogressive ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer.

The aim of this study is to determine the effect of a home-based health education intervention for increasing cervical cancer screening uptake delivered by trained female community health volunteers (FCHVs), a category of community health worker in Nepal.<h4>Methods</h4>A community-based, open-label, two-armed, cluster-randomized trial [seven clusters (geographical wards) randomized for the intervention, and seven for the control arm]. The participants are recruited from a population-based survey with a sample size of 884. Based on population proportion size, 277 women will be recruited for the intervention group and 413 women recruited for the control group. A 12-month community-based health education intervention will be administered mobilizing the FCHVs, based on the Health Belief Model. The primary outcome measure of the study will be the difference in percentage of cervical cancer screening uptake between the two study arms.

The aim of this study is to determine the effect of a home-based health education intervention for increasing cervical cancer screening uptake delivered by trained female community health volunteers (FCHVs), a category of community health worker in Nepal.<h4>Methods</h4>A community-based, open-label, two-armed, cluster-randomized trial [seven clusters (geographical wards) randomized for the intervention, and seven for the control arm]. The participants are recruited from a population-based survey with a sample size of 884. Based on population proportion size, 277 women will be recruited for the intervention group and 413 women recruited for the control group. A 12-month community-based health education intervention will be administered mobilizing the FCHVs, based on the Health Belief Model. The primary outcome measure of the study will be the difference in percentage of cervical cancer screening uptake between the two study arms. The primary outcomes will be modeled by using mixed-effect logistic regression analysis.<h4>Discussion</h4>COBIN-C is the first study investigating the effect of a community-based health education intervention by FCHVs on increasing cervical cancer screening uptake among women in Nepal.

This prospective study aims at further documenting the improved effect of the \"Sandwich\" urethra reconstruction technique on continence at the early stage after LRP.<h4>Methods</h4>During the period from October 2017 to December 2018, 130 patients undergoing LRP in our institution were recruited into this prospective study. Sixty-six patients in Group A received LRP with the \"Sandwich\" technique of urethra reconstruction, while the remaining 64 patients in Group B did not adopt this reconstruction technique. The basic clinical data, perioperative related data, urinary continence, and urodynamic tests were analyzed and evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>There is no statistical difference in patients' basic clinical data, perioperative related data except urethral reconstruction time, which was 23.49\u00b14.72 minutes in Group A and 20.16\u00b15.75 minutes in Group B (<i>P</i><0.001). The continence rates in Group A at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks were 54.55%, 83.33%, 93.94%, and 96.97%, respectively. The continence rates in Group B were 10.94%, 14.06%, 37.50%, and 71.88%, respectively. The continence rate of Group A was significantly higher after surgery compared with Group B (<i>P</i><0.001). Maximum flow rates before and after the \"Sandwich\" procedure for 12 months were 13.2\u00b12.8 m/s and 15.4\u00b13.6 m/s, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.034).

This prospective study aims at further documenting the improved effect of the \"Sandwich\" urethra reconstruction technique on continence at the early stage after LRP.<h4>Methods</h4>During the period from October 2017 to December 2018, 130 patients undergoing LRP in our institution were recruited into this prospective study. Sixty-six patients in Group A received LRP with the \"Sandwich\" technique of urethra reconstruction, while the remaining 64 patients in Group B did not adopt this reconstruction technique. The basic clinical data, perioperative related data, urinary continence, and urodynamic tests were analyzed and evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>There is no statistical difference in patients' basic clinical data, perioperative related data except urethral reconstruction time, which was 23.49\u00b14.72 minutes in Group A and 20.16\u00b15.75 minutes in Group B (<i>P</i><0.001). The continence rates in Group A at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks were 54.55%, 83.33%, 93.94%, and 96.97%, respectively. The continence rates in Group B were 10.94%, 14.06%, 37.50%, and 71.88%, respectively. The continence rate of Group A was significantly higher after surgery compared with Group B (<i>P</i><0.001).

Historically, patients have received complete larynx radiotherapy (CL-RT) due to fear of swallowing and respiratory laryngeal motion and this remains the standard approach in many academic institutions. Local control (LC) rates with CL-RT have been excellent, however this treatment can carry significant toxicities include adverse voice and swallowing outcomes, along with increased long-term risk of cerebrovascular morbidity. A recent retrospective study reported improved voice quality and similar local control outcomes with focused vocal cord radiotherapy (VC-RT) compared to CL-RT. There is currently no prospective evidence on the safety of VC-RT. The primary objective of this Bayesian Phase II trial is to compare the LC of VC-RT to that of CL-RT in patients with T1N0 glottic SCC.<h4>Methods</h4>One hundred and fifty-five patients with T1a-b N0 SCC of the true vocal cords that are n ot candidate or declined laser surgery, will be randomized in a 1:3 ratio the control arm (CL-RT) and the experimental arm (VC-RT). Randomisation will be stratified by tumor stage (T1a/T1b) and by site (each site will be allowed to select one preferred radiation dose regimen, to be used in both arms). CL-RT volumes will correspond to the conventional RT volumes, with the planning target volume extending from the top of thyroid cartilage lamina superiorly to the bottom of the cricoid inferiorly. VC-RT volumes will include the involved vocal cord(s) and a margin accounting for respiration and set-up uncertainty. The primary endpoint will be LC at 2-years, while secondary endpoints will include patient-reported outcomes (voice impairment, dysphagia and symptom burden), acute and late toxicity radiation-induced toxicity, overall survival, progression free survival, as well as an optional component of acoustic and objective measures of voice analysis using the Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice.<h4>Discussion</h4>This study would constitute the first prospective evidence on the efficacy and safety of VC-RT in early glottic cancer. If positive, this study would result in the adoption of VC-RT as standard approach in early glottic cancer.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03759431 Registration date: November 30, 2018.", "affiliation": "Radiation Oncology Department, Centre Hospitalier de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, 1051 Sanguinet, Montreal, QC, H2X 3E4, Canada.

(LR), patients with hepatocellular cancer (HCC) are at high risk of recurrence. There are no approved anti-cancer therapies known to affect such risk, highlighting the acute need for novel systemic therapies to control the probability of disease relapse. Immunotherapy is expanding as a novel treatment option for HCC. Emerging data from cohort 4 of the CA209-040 study, which investigated the safety and preliminary efficacy of nivolumab/ipilimumab co-administration in advanced HCC, suggest that the combination can be delivered safely with an acceptable proportion of reversible grade 3-4 toxicities (27.1%) and a low discontinuation rate (2%) in patients with HCC.

"<h4>Background</h4>The current standard postoperative treatment for stage II-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a regimen of platinum doublet adjuvant chemotherapy. These regimens, which are the same as for solid NSCLC tumors, often cause severe adverse reactions in the treated patients. Therefore, an effective treatment regimen with fewer side effects is needed.<h4>Methods/design</h4>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of S-1 monotherapy (80\u2009mg/m<sup>2</sup> orally administrated twice daily, at day 1-14, 16\u2009cycles) and cisplatin with vinorelbine combination therapy (cisplatin 80\u2009mg/m<sup>2</sup> at day 1,vinorelbine 25\u2009mg/m<sup>2</sup> at day 1, 8, 4\u2009cycles) in patients with II/IIIA stage non-small-cell lung cancer who underwent a total resection. In addition, we will also evaluate the level of treatment side effects by assessing quality of life (QOL), work productivity and activity performance. The primary endpoint is a 2-year relapse free survival (RFS) and the second primary endpoints are 2-year overall survival (OS), rate of treatment completion, safety, work productivity and activity, and quality of adjusted life years (QALY). At the same time, we aim to obtain precise information required to perform future phase 3 randomized controlled trials. The study is designed to estimate the primary endpoint with accuracy determined as the width of its 95% confidence interval to be less than 20%. Recruitment started in May 2017 and is ongoing.<h4>Discussion</h4>This study has been conceived to establish a superior regimen for completely resected NSCLC based on efficacy, safety and QOL.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Registry number: UMIN000027435 .

postoperative treatment for stage II-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a regimen of platinum doublet adjuvant chemotherapy. These regimens, which are the same as for solid NSCLC tumors, often cause severe adverse reactions in the treated patients. Therefore, an effective treatment regimen with fewer side effects is needed.<h4>Methods/design</h4>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of S-1 monotherapy (80\u2009mg/m<sup>2</sup> orally administrated twice daily, at day 1-14, 16\u2009cycles) and cisplatin with vinorelbine combination therapy (cisplatin 80\u2009mg/m<sup>2</sup> at day 1,vinorelbine 25\u2009mg/m<sup>2</sup> at day 1, 8, 4\u2009cycles) in patients with II/IIIA stage non-small-cell lung cancer who underwent a total resection. In addition, we will also evaluate the level of treatment side effects by assessing quality of life (QOL), work productivity and activity performance. The primary endpoint is a 2-year relapse free survival (RFS) and the second primary endpoints are 2-year overall survival (OS), rate of treatment completion, safety, work productivity and activity, and quality of adjusted life years (QALY). At the same time, we aim to obtain precise information required to perform future phase 3 randomized controlled trials. The study is designed to estimate the primary endpoint with accuracy determined as the width of its 95% confidence interval to be less than 20%. Recruitment started in May 2017 and is ongoing.<h4>Discussion</h4>This study has been conceived to establish a superior regimen for completely resected NSCLC based on efficacy, safety and QOL.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Registry number: UMIN000027435 .

glucocorticoid infusion pulse therapy to improve the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with elevated inflammatory biomarkers.<h4>Trial design</h4>A parallel-group quadruple-blind (participant, intervention provider, outcome assessor and data manager), randomised controlled trial.<h4>Participants</h4>All patients admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 pneumonia will be considered eligible. Potential candidates will be identified and consecutively included in the emergency room or in the COVID-19 admission wards of two hospitals in Spain: Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra (Pamplona) and Hospital Mois\u00e8s Broggi (Sant Joan Desp\u00ed, Barcelona). Inclusion criteria are: 1) age \u226518 years old; 2) diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum in accordance with the recommendations of the Spanish Ministry of Health; 3) history of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 \u22657 days; 4) hospital admission; 5) at least one of the following: C-reactive protein (CRP) >60 mg/dL, interleukin-6 (IL-6) >40 pg/mL, and/or ferritin >1000 \u03bcg/L; and 6) provision of informed consent. Exclusion criteria are: 1) allergy or contraindication to any of the drugs under study; 2) oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) <90% (in air ambient) or partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO<sub>2</sub>) <60 mmHg (in ambient air) or PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> <300 mmHg; 3) ongoing treatment with glucocorticoids, or other immunosuppressants, including biologics for another indication; 4) decompensated diabetes mellitus; 5) uncontrolled hypertension; 6) psychotic or manic disorder; 7) active cancer; 8) pregnancy or breastfeeding; 9) clinical or biochemical suspicion (procalcitonin >0.5 ng/mL) of active infection other than with SARS-CoV-2; 10) management as an outpatient; 11) conservative or palliative management; 12) participation in another clinical trial; or 13) any major uncontrolled medical, psychological, psychiatric, geographic or social problem that contraindicates the patient's participation in the trial or hinders proper follow-up and adherence to the protocol and evaluation of study outcomes.<h4>Intervention and comparator</h4>Eligible patients will be randomised to receive standard of care plus methylprednisolone (intervention group) or standard of care plus placebo (control group). Intervention group: standard of care at the discretion of the researcher, including lopinavir/ritonavir (200/50 mg, 2 tablets twice daily, per os, for 7 to 14 days) \u00b1 remdesivir (a single intravenous loading dose of 200 mg on day 1 followed by once-daily intravenous maintenance doses of 100 mg from day 2 to 5), or no drug treatment, + methylprednisolone (once-daily intravenous infusion of 120 mg on days 1, 2 and 3).<h4>Control group</h4>standard of care at the discretion of the researcher, including lopinavir/ritonavir (200/50 mg, 2 tablets every 12 hours, per os, for 7 to 14 days) \u00b1 remdesivir (a single intravenous loading dose of 200 mg on day 1 followed by once-daily intravenous maintenance doses of 100 mg from day 2 to 5), or no drug treatment, + placebo (once-daily intravenous infusion of 100 mL of 0.9% saline on days 1, 2 and 3).<h4>Main outcomes</h4>The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with treatment failure at 14 days after randomisation, defined as: 1) death, 2) need for admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), 3) initiation of mechanical ventilation, 4) SpO<sub>2</sub> falling to <90% (in ambient air) or PaO<sub>2</sub> <60 mmHg (in ambient air) or PaO<sub>2</sub>FiO<sub>2</sub> <300 mmHg, not explained by a cause other than COVID-19, and/or 5) decrease in PaO<sub>2</sub> \u226515% from baseline, together with laboratory and radiological deterioration.<h4>Randomisation</h4>Treatment will be allocated by block randomisation stratified by patient age (< or \u2265 75 years of age). For this purpose, we will use the R randomizeR package using two block sizes (4 and 6) with random permutation. The randomisation sequence will be generated by a unit (the Navarrabiomed Clinical Trials Platform) independent from the researchers who will recruit patients and implement the protocol.<h4>Blinding (masking)</h4>The study will be quadruple-blinded, specifically, with blinding of patients, intervention providers, outcome assessors and data managers. The pharmacy at each participating hospital will prepare indistinguishable bags of methylprednisolone or placebo (0.9% saline) for patients of the experimental and placebo groups, respectively.<h4>Numbers to be randomised (sample size)</h4>The percentage of patients with treatment failure (primary endpoint) is currently unknown. Assuming an absolute difference of 25% in the primary outcome between the two groups (35% in the control group and 10% in the intervention group), we estimate that 60 patients (30 per group) are required to detect this difference with a two-tailed type I error of 0.05 and a type II error of 0.2. Estimating a loss to follow-up of 20%, we should recruit a total sample size of 72 patients (36 per group).<h4>Trial status</h4>The Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices (AEMPS) and the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital La Princesa approved version 7.0 of the protocol on 30 April 2020 as a low intervention clinical trial. Subsequently, the protocol has been amended by researchers and re-approved by AEMPS and the same ethics committee on 1 July 2020 (version 8.0) and on 28 August 2020 (version 9.0). Currently, the trial is in the recruitment phase.

Potential candidates will be identified and consecutively included in the emergency room or in the COVID-19 admission wards of two hospitals in Spain: Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra (Pamplona) and Hospital Mois\u00e8s Broggi (Sant Joan Desp\u00ed, Barcelona). Inclusion criteria are: 1) age \u226518 years old; 2) diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum in accordance with the recommendations of the Spanish Ministry of Health; 3) history of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 \u22657 days; 4) hospital admission; 5) at least one of the following: C-reactive protein (CRP) >60 mg/dL, interleukin-6 (IL-6) >40 pg/mL, and/or ferritin >1000 \u03bcg/L; and 6) provision of informed consent. Exclusion criteria are: 1) allergy or contraindication to any of the drugs under study; 2) oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) <90% (in air ambient) or partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO<sub>2</sub>) <60 mmHg (in ambient air) or PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> <300 mmHg; 3) ongoing treatment with glucocorticoids, or other immunosuppressants, including biologics for another indication; 4) decompensated diabetes mellitus; 5) uncontrolled hypertension; 6) psychotic or manic disorder; 7) active cancer; 8) pregnancy or breastfeeding; 9) clinical or biochemical suspicion (procalcitonin >0.5 ng/mL) of active infection other than with SARS-CoV-2; 10) management as an outpatient; 11) conservative or palliative management; 12) participation in another clinical trial; or 13) any major uncontrolled medical, psychological, psychiatric, geographic or social problem that contraindicates the patient's participation in the trial or hinders proper follow-up and adherence to the protocol and evaluation of study outcomes.<h4>Intervention and comparator</h4>Eligible patients will be randomised to receive standard of care plus methylprednisolone (intervention group) or standard of care plus placebo (control group). Intervention group: standard of care at the discretion of the researcher, including lopinavir/ritonavir (200/50 mg, 2 tablets twice daily, per os, for 7 to 14 days) \u00b1 remdesivir (a single intravenous loading dose of 200 mg on day 1 followed by once-daily intravenous maintenance doses of 100 mg from day 2 to 5), or no drug treatment, + methylprednisolone (once-daily intravenous infusion of 120 mg on days 1, 2 and 3).<h4>Control group</h4>standard of care at the discretion of the researcher, including lopinavir/ritonavir (200/50 mg, 2 tablets every 12 hours, per os, for 7 to 14 days) \u00b1 remdesivir (a single intravenous loading dose of 200 mg on day 1 followed by once-daily intravenous maintenance doses of 100 mg from day 2 to 5), or no drug treatment, + placebo (once-daily intravenous infusion of 100 mL of 0.9% saline on days 1, 2 and 3).<h4>Main outcomes</h4>The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with treatment failure at 14 days after randomisation, defined as: 1) death, 2) need for admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), 3) initiation of mechanical ventilation, 4) SpO<sub>2</sub> falling to <90% (in ambient air) or PaO<sub>2</sub> <60 mmHg (in ambient air) or PaO<sub>2</sub>FiO<sub>2</sub> <300 mmHg, not explained by a cause other than COVID-19, and/or 5) decrease in PaO<sub>2</sub> \u226515% from baseline, together with laboratory and radiological deterioration.<h4>Randomisation</h4>Treatment will be allocated by block randomisation stratified by patient age (< or \u2265 75 years of age). For this purpose, we will use the R randomizeR package using two block sizes (4 and 6) with random permutation. The randomisation sequence will be generated by a unit (the Navarrabiomed Clinical Trials Platform) independent from the researchers who will recruit patients and implement the protocol.<h4>Blinding (masking)</h4>The study will be quadruple-blinded, specifically, with blinding of patients, intervention providers, outcome assessors and data managers. The pharmacy at each participating hospital will prepare indistinguishable bags of methylprednisolone or placebo (0.9% saline) for patients of the experimental and placebo groups, respectively.<h4>Numbers to be randomised (sample size)</h4>The percentage of patients with treatment failure (primary endpoint) is currently unknown. Assuming an absolute difference of 25% in the primary outcome between the two groups (35% in the control group and 10% in the intervention group), we estimate that 60 patients (30 per group) are required to detect this difference with a two-tailed type I error of 0.05 and a type II error of 0.2. Estimating a loss to follow-up of 20%, we should recruit a total sample size of 72 patients (36 per group).<h4>Trial status</h4>The Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices (AEMPS) and the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital La Princesa approved version 7.0 of the protocol on 30 April 2020 as a low intervention clinical trial. Subsequently, the protocol has been amended by researchers and re-approved by AEMPS and the same ethics committee on 1 July 2020 (version 8.0) and on 28 August 2020 (version 9.0). Currently, the trial is in the recruitment phase. Recruitment began on 28 May 2020 and is expected to be completed by February 2021.<h4>Trial registration</h4>This study protocol was registered on the eudract.ema.europa.eu on 5 May 2020 (title \"Early treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia with glucocorticoids.

on clinical deterioration in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who require hospitalisation. The safety of these drugs in COVID-19 patients will also be evaluated.<h4>Trial design</h4>This is a single-centre, prospective, four-arm parallel design, open-label, randomized control trial.<h4>Participants</h4>The study will be conducted at National Cancer Institute (NCI), Jhajjar, Haryana, which is a part of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, and has been converted into a dedicated COVID-19 management centre since the outbreak of the pandemic. All RT-PCR confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection with age \u2265 40 years and < 75 years requiring hospital admission (patients with WHO clinical improvement ordinal score 3 to 5) will be included in the trial. Written informed consent will be taken for all recruited patients. Patients with a critical illness (WHO clinical improvement ordinal score > 5), documented significant liver disease/dysfunction (aspartate transaminase [AST] / alanine aminotransferase [ALT] > 240), myopathy and rhabdomyolysis (creatine phosphokinase [CPK] > 5x normal), allergy or intolerance to statins or aspirin, prior statin or aspirin use within 30 days, history of active gastrointestinal bleeding in past three months, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100000/ dl), pregnancy, active breastfeeding, or inability to take oral or nasogastric medications will be excluded. Patients refusing to give written consent and taking drugs that are known to have a significant drug interaction with statin or aspirin [including cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors, hepatitis C protease inhibitor, telaprevir, fibric acid derivatives (gemfibrozil), niacin, azole antifungals (itraconazole, ketoconazole), clarithromycin and colchicine] will also be excluded from the trial.<h4>Intervention and comparator</h4>In this study, the benefit and safety of atorvastatin (statin) and/or aspirin as adjuvant therapy will be compared with the control group receiving usual care for management of COVID-19. Atorvastatin will be prescribed as 40 mg oral tablets once daily for ten days or until discharge, whichever is earlier. The dose of aspirin will be 75 mg once daily for ten days or until discharge, whichever is earlier. All other therapies will be administered according to the institute's COVID-19 treatment protocol and the treating physician's clinical judgment.<h4>Main outcomes</h4>All study participants will be prospectively followed up for ten days or until hospital discharge, whichever is longer for outcomes. The primary outcome will be clinical deterioration characterized by progression to WHO clinical improvement ordinal score \u2265 6 (i.e., endotracheal intubation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, pressor agents, renal replacement therapy, ECMO requirement, and mortality). The secondary outcomes will be change in serum inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and Interleukin-6), Troponin I, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) from time zero to 5th day of study enrolment or 7th day after symptom onset, whichever is later. Other clinical outcomes that will be assessed include progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), shock, ICU admission, length of ICU admission, length of hospital admission, and in-hospital mortality. Adverse drug effects like myalgia, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, hepatotoxicity, and bleeding will also be examined in the trial to assess the safety of the interventions.<h4>Randomisation</h4>The study will use a four-arm parallel-group design. A computer-generated permuted block randomization with mixed block size will be used to randomize the participants in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to group A (atorvastatin with conventional therapy), group B (aspirin with conventional therapy), group C (aspirin + atorvastatin with conventional therapy), and group D (control; only conventional therapy).<h4>Blinding (masking)</h4>The study will be an open-label trial.<h4>Numbers to be randomised (sample size)</h4>As there is no existing study that has evaluated the role of aspirin and atorvastatin in COVID-19 patients, formal sample size calculation has not been done. Patients satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited during six months of study period. Once the first 200 patients are included in each arm (i.e., total 800 patients), the final sample size calculation will be done on the basis of the interim analysis of the collected data.<h4>Trial status</h4>The institutional ethical committee has approved the study protocol (Protocol version 3.0 [June 2020]). Participant recruitment starting date: 28<sup>th</sup> July 2020 Participant recruitment ending date: 27<sup>th</sup> January 2021 Trial duration: 6 months TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial has been prospectively registered in Clinical Trial Registry - India (ICMR- NIMS): Reference no.

All RT-PCR confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection with age \u2265 40 years and < 75 years requiring hospital admission (patients with WHO clinical improvement ordinal score 3 to 5) will be included in the trial. Written informed consent will be taken for all recruited patients. Patients with a critical illness (WHO clinical improvement ordinal score > 5), documented significant liver disease/dysfunction (aspartate transaminase [AST] / alanine aminotransferase [ALT] > 240), myopathy and rhabdomyolysis (creatine phosphokinase [CPK] > 5x normal), allergy or intolerance to statins or aspirin, prior statin or aspirin use within 30 days, history of active gastrointestinal bleeding in past three months, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100000/ dl), pregnancy, active breastfeeding, or inability to take oral or nasogastric medications will be excluded. Patients refusing to give written consent and taking drugs that are known to have a significant drug interaction with statin or aspirin [including cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors, hepatitis C protease inhibitor, telaprevir, fibric acid derivatives (gemfibrozil), niacin, azole antifungals (itraconazole, ketoconazole), clarithromycin and colchicine] will also be excluded from the trial.<h4>Intervention and comparator</h4>In this study, the benefit and safety of atorvastatin (statin) and/or aspirin as adjuvant therapy will be compared with the control group receiving usual care for management of COVID-19. Atorvastatin will be prescribed as 40 mg oral tablets once daily for ten days or until discharge, whichever is earlier. The dose of aspirin will be 75 mg once daily for ten days or until discharge, whichever is earlier. All other therapies will be administered according to the institute's COVID-19 treatment protocol and the treating physician's clinical judgment.<h4>Main outcomes</h4>All study participants will be prospectively followed up for ten days or until hospital discharge, whichever is longer for outcomes. The primary outcome will be clinical deterioration characterized by progression to WHO clinical improvement ordinal score \u2265 6 (i.e., endotracheal intubation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, pressor agents, renal replacement therapy, ECMO requirement, and mortality). The secondary outcomes will be change in serum inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and Interleukin-6), Troponin I, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) from time zero to 5th day of study enrolment or 7th day after symptom onset, whichever is later. Other clinical outcomes that will be assessed include progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), shock, ICU admission, length of ICU admission, length of hospital admission, and in-hospital mortality. Adverse drug effects like myalgia, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, hepatotoxicity, and bleeding will also be examined in the trial to assess the safety of the interventions.<h4>Randomisation</h4>The study will use a four-arm parallel-group design. A computer-generated permuted block randomization with mixed block size will be used to randomize the participants in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to group A (atorvastatin with conventional therapy), group B (aspirin with conventional therapy), group C (aspirin + atorvastatin with conventional therapy), and group D (control; only conventional therapy).<h4>Blinding (masking)</h4>The study will be an open-label trial.<h4>Numbers to be randomised (sample size)</h4>As there is no existing study that has evaluated the role of aspirin and atorvastatin in COVID-19 patients, formal sample size calculation has not been done. Patients satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited during six months of study period. Once the first 200 patients are included in each arm (i.e., total 800 patients), the final sample size calculation will be done on the basis of the interim analysis of the collected data.<h4>Trial status</h4>The institutional ethical committee has approved the study protocol (Protocol version 3.0 [June 2020]). Participant recruitment starting date: 28<sup>th</sup> July 2020 Participant recruitment ending date: 27<sup>th</sup> January 2021 Trial duration: 6 months TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial has been prospectively registered in Clinical Trial Registry - India (ICMR- NIMS): Reference no. CTRI/2020/07/026791 (registered on 25 July 2020)].<h4>Full protocol</h4>The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1).

The CLASSIC and ACTS-GC studies showed that the 5-year overall survival (OS) of patients with stage III gastric cancer undergoing D2 gastrectomy is still very low. Whether adjuvant nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) combined chemotherapy is more effective than the XELOX standard adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage III gastric cancer has not been confirmed.<h4>Methods</h4>This is a multicenter, open-label, phase III clinical study. In this trial, 616 patients with locally advanced stage III gastric cancer that underwent curative D2 radical surgery and achieved R0 are planned to be included. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to nab-paclitaxel combined with S-1 (AS) vs. oxaliplatin combined with capecitabine (XELOX). XELOX group: Patients assigned to the XELOX group received eight 3-week\u2009cycles of oral capecitabine (1000\u2009mg/m<sup>2</sup>) twice daily on days 1-14 of each cycle plus intravenous oxaliplatin 130\u2009mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1 of each cycle.

The primary endpoint was the 3-year disease-free survival (3-year-DFS) defined as the time from randomisation to the time of recurrence of the original gastric cancer, development of a new gastric cancer, or death from any cause. The secondary endpoints were the overall survival, (defined as the time from the date of randomisation to date of death from any cause) and safety (any adverse event).<h4>Discussion</h4>Compared with previous studies, this study includes nab-paclitaxel based on S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy, which is expected to achieve better efficacy and lower toxicity than the standard treatment.

For proper translation of these results to clinical guidelines, it is essential to determine how well the general population is reflected in the study populations of these trials. This study was conducted among 7162 participants (age-range: 51-106\u00a0years; 58% women) from the Rotterdam Study. We quantified the proportion of participants that would be eligible for the nine ongoing phase-III trials. We further quantified the eligibility among participants at high risk to develop severe COVID-19. Since many trials were not explicit in their exclusion criterion with respect to 'acute' or 'unstable preexisting' diseases, we performed two analyses. First, we included all participants irrespective of this criterion. Second, we excluded persons with acute or 'unstable preexisting' diseases. 97% of 7162 participants was eligible for any trial with eligibility for separate trials ranging between 11-97%. For high-risk individuals the corresponding numbers were 96% for any trial with separate trials ranging from 5-96%. Importantly, considering persons ineligible due to 'acute' or 'unstable pre-existing' disease drastically dropped the eligibilities for all trials below 43% for the total population and below 36% for high-risk individuals. The eligibility for ongoing vaccine trials against SARS-CoV-2 can reduce by half depending on interpretation and application of a single unspecified exclusion criterion.

For proper translation of these results to clinical guidelines, it is essential to determine how well the general population is reflected in the study populations of these trials. This study was conducted among 7162 participants (age-range: 51-106\u00a0years; 58% women) from the Rotterdam Study. We quantified the proportion of participants that would be eligible for the nine ongoing phase-III trials. We further quantified the eligibility among participants at high risk to develop severe COVID-19. Since many trials were not explicit in their exclusion criterion with respect to 'acute' or 'unstable preexisting' diseases, we performed two analyses. First, we included all participants irrespective of this criterion. Second, we excluded persons with acute or 'unstable preexisting' diseases. 97% of 7162 participants was eligible for any trial with eligibility for separate trials ranging between 11-97%. For high-risk individuals the corresponding numbers were 96% for any trial with separate trials ranging from 5-96%. Importantly, considering persons ineligible due to 'acute' or 'unstable pre-existing' disease drastically dropped the eligibilities for all trials below 43% for the total population and below 36% for high-risk individuals. The eligibility for ongoing vaccine trials against SARS-CoV-2 can reduce by half depending on interpretation and application of a single unspecified exclusion criterion. This exclusion criterion in our study would especially affect the elderly and those with pre-existing morbidities. These findings thus indicate the difficulty as well as importance of developing clinical recommendations for vaccination and applying these to the appropriate target populations. This becomes especially paramount considering the fact that many countries worldwide have initiated their vaccination programs by first targeting the elderly and most vulnerable persons.", "Keywords":

"<h4>Background</h4>Triple negative breast cancer affects 10% to 20% of all women diagnosed with breast cancer. Due to its characteristics, treatment strategies are limited and metastatic recurrences are common in the first 5 years after treatment. However, not all patients affected by this disease develop metastases. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes have shown to be reliable predictive biomarkers of treatment response and metastatic recurrences. However, we need to develop simpler and faster ways to predict response to cytotoxic treatment and the possibility of eventual cancer relapse by identifying new biomarkers. Recently, new studies are emerging, suggesting a predictive role of circulating blood cells in different types of cancer. In this study, we will assess the correlation between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and different elements of the blood count in patients diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer.<h4>Methods</h4>The main objective of this study is to evaluate the correlation between the peripheral neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and the amount of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, assessed in triple negative breast cancer patients at diagnosis. Secondary objectives include evaluation of the correlation between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes at diagnosis and the baseline absolute neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet counts, as well as the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio. The triple negative breast cancer patients will be enrolled in the PERCEPTION trial during the first year after the treatment completion. Two supplementary blood tests, at 12 months after the end of treatment and at the time of the first metastatic recurrence, will be performed.<h4>Discussion</h4>The discovery of new prognostic and predictive biomarkers is crucial for triple negative breast cancer. We set up the PERCEPTION clinical trial in order to evaluate certain blood counts as early biomarkers and to assess their correlation with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Demonstration of comparative predictive and/or prognostic capacities of peripheral blood counts and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes would allow introduction of the former as simple and cheap biomarkers in triple negative breast cancer patient management.<h4>Trial registration</h4>The PERCEPTION study has been registered in the French National Agency of Medical Security registry on the 2nd of July 2019 under the number 2019-A01861-56 and in the ClinicalTrials.org registry under the number NCT04068623.", "affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 Clermont Auvergne, INSERM UMR 1240 \u00abImagerie Mol\u00e9culaire et Strat\u00e9gies Th\u00e9ranostiques\u00bb, Centre Jean Perrin, 58 rue Montalembert, 63000 Clermont-Ferrand.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Clinical Trial Protocol", "research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Blood Platelets", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "ME", "qualifierName": "metabolism", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Neutrophils", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "ME", "qualifierName": "metabolism", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Lymphocytes", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "ME", "qualifierName": "metabolism", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "ME", "qualifierName": "metabolism", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Breast Neoplasms", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "BL", "qualifierName": "blood", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}, {"abbreviation": "MO", "qualifierName": "mortality", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "BL", "qualifierName": "blood", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "MO", "qualifierName": "mortality", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Lymphocyte Count"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Platelet Count"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Prognosis"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Predictive Value of Tests"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Adult"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Female"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Young Adult"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "BL", "qualifierName": "blood", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}, {"abbreviation": "MO", "qualifierName": "mortality", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Biomarkers, Tumor", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "BL", "qualifierName": "blood", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}]}, "chemicalList": {"chemical": {"name": "Biomarkers, Tumor", "registryNumber": "0"}}, "subsetList": {"subset": [{"code": "AIM", "name": "Core clinical journals"}, {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000023418"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7738079"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7738079?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "N", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "Y", "tmAccessionTypeList": {"accessionType": "nct"}, "dateOfCompletion": "2021-01-04", "dateOfCreation": "2020-12-17", "firstIndexDate": "2020-12-24", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-12-18", "dateOfRevision": "2021-05-07", "firstPublicationDate": "2020-12-01"}, "htmllinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7738079", "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Triple negative breast cancer affects 10% to 20% of all women diagnosed with breast cancer.

emerging procedure to treat peritoneal metastasis of gastric cancer. Data about HIPEC in locally advanced gastric cancer is scarce. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and toxicity of prophylactic HIPEC with cisplatin for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer.<h4>Methods</h4>From March 2015 to November 2016, a prospective, randomized phase II trial was conducted. After radical gastrectomy, patients in the experimental group underwent HIPEC with cisplatin followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with SOX regime. Patients in the other group were treated with SOX regime alone. Postoperative complications and patient survival were compared.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 50 patients were eligible for analyses. No significant difference was found in the incidence of postoperative complications including anastomotic/intestinal leakage, liver dysfunction, bone marrow suppression, wound infection and ileus (P\u2009>\u20090.05). Mean duration of hospitalization after radical gastrectomy was 11.7\u2009days. 12.2\u2009days in experimental group and 10.8\u2009days in control group respectively (P\u2009=\u20090.255). The percentage of patients with elevated tumor markers was 12.1% in experimental group, which was significantly lower than 41.2% in control group (P\u2009=\u20090.02). 3-year RFS of patients who treated with or without prophylactic HIPEC were 84.8 and 88.2% respectively (P\u2009=\u20090.986). In the multivariate analysis, pathological T stage was the only independent risk factor for the RFS of patients (P\u2009=\u20090.012, HR =15.071).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Additional intraoperative HIPEC with cisplatin did not increase postoperative complications for locally advanced gastric cancer after curative surgery. Prophylactic HIPEC with cisplatin was safe and tolerable, while it did not reduce the risk of peritoneal recurrence in this trial, supporting further studies to validate the efficacy of it.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR2000038331.

While prophylactic anticoagulation is now widely recommended for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the effectiveness and safety of thromboprophylaxis in outpatients with COVID-19 has not been established.<h4>Study design</h4>PREVENT-HD is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, pragmatic, event-driven phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in symptomatic outpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 at risk for thrombotic events, hospitalization, and death. Several challenges posed by the pandemic have necessitated innovative approaches to clinical trial design, start-up, and conduct. Participants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by time from COVID-19 confirmation, to either rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily or placebo for 35 days. The primary efficacy end point is a composite of symptomatic venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, non-central nervous system systemic embolization, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality.

Several challenges posed by the pandemic have necessitated innovative approaches to clinical trial design, start-up, and conduct. Participants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by time from COVID-19 confirmation, to either rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily or placebo for 35 days. The primary efficacy end point is a composite of symptomatic venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, non-central nervous system systemic embolization, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality. The primary safety end point is fatal and critical site bleeding according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis definition.

"abstractText": "<h4>Introduction</h4>(Neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer has a deleterious impact on muscle tissue resulting in reduced cardiorespiratory fitness, skeletal muscle mass and function. Physical exercise during treatment may counteract some of these negative effects. However, the effects of resistance training (RT) alone have never been explored. The present study aims to investigate if heavy-load RT during (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy counteracts deleterious effects on skeletal muscle in women diagnosed with breast cancer. We hypothesize that (neo-)adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy will reduce muscle fiber size, impair mitochondrial function, and increase indicators of cellular stress and that RT during treatment will counteract these negative effects. We also hypothesize that RT during (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy will increase muscle and blood levels of potential antitumor myokines and reduce treatment-related side effects on muscle strength and cardiorespiratory fitness.<h4>Methods</h4>Fifty women recently diagnosed with breast cancer scheduled to start (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy will be randomized to either randomized to either intervention group or to control group.The intervention group will perform supervised heavy-load RT twice a week over the course of chemotherapy (approximately 16-weeks) whereas the control group will be encouraged to continue with their usual activities. Muscle biopsies from m. vastus lateralis will be collected before the first cycle of chemotherapy (T0), after chemotherapy (T1), and 6 months later (T2) for assessment of muscle cellular outcomes.

Physical exercise during treatment may counteract some of these negative effects. However, the effects of resistance training (RT) alone have never been explored. The present study aims to investigate if heavy-load RT during (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy counteracts deleterious effects on skeletal muscle in women diagnosed with breast cancer. We hypothesize that (neo-)adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy will reduce muscle fiber size, impair mitochondrial function, and increase indicators of cellular stress and that RT during treatment will counteract these negative effects. We also hypothesize that RT during (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy will increase muscle and blood levels of potential antitumor myokines and reduce treatment-related side effects on muscle strength and cardiorespiratory fitness.<h4>Methods</h4>Fifty women recently diagnosed with breast cancer scheduled to start (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy will be randomized to either randomized to either intervention group or to control group.The intervention group will perform supervised heavy-load RT twice a week over the course of chemotherapy (approximately 16-weeks) whereas the control group will be encouraged to continue with their usual activities. Muscle biopsies from m. vastus lateralis will be collected before the first cycle of chemotherapy (T0), after chemotherapy (T1), and 6 months later (T2) for assessment of muscle cellular outcomes. The primary outcome for this study is muscle fiber size. Secondary outcomes are: regulators of muscle fiber size and function, indicators of cellular stress and mitochondrial function, myokines with potential antitumor effects, muscle strength, and cardiorespiratory fitness.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>Ethical approval has been obtained from the Regional Ethical Review Board in Uppsala, Sweden (Dnr:2016/230/2).

We aimed to assess the activity and safety of an intensive, CNS-directed chemoimmunotherapy consolidated by autologous haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) in patients with secondary CNS lymphoma.<h4>Methods</h4>This international, single-arm, phase 2 trial was done in 24 hospitals in Italy, the UK, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. Adults (aged 18-70 years) with histologically diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement at the time of primary diagnosis or at relapse and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 3 or less were enrolled and received three courses of MATRix (rituximab 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, intravenous infusion, day 0; methotrexate 3\u00b75 g/m<sup>2</sup>, the first 0\u00b75 g/m<sup>2</sup> in 15 min followed by 3 g/m<sup>2</sup> in a 3 h intravenous infusion, day 1; cytarabine 2 g/m<sup>2</sup> every 12 h, in 1 h intravenous infusions, days 2 and 3; thiotepa 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, 30 min intravenous infusion, day 4) followed by three courses of RICE (rituximab 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, day 1; etoposide 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day in 500-1000 mL over a 60 min intravenous infusion, days 1, 2, and 3; ifosfamide 5 g/m<sup>2</sup> in 1000 mL in a 24 h intravenous infusion with mesna support, day 2; carboplatin area under the curve of 5 in 500 mL in a 1 h intravenous infusion, day 2) and carmustine-thiotepa and autologous HSCT (carmustine 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> in 500 mL glucose 5% solution in a 1-2 h infusion, day -6; thiotepa 5 mg/kg in saline solution in a 2 h infusion every 12 h, days -5 and -4). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 1 year. Overall and complete response rates before autologous HSCT, duration of response, overall survival, and safety were the secondary endpoints. Analyses were in the modified intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02329080. The trial ended after accrual completion; the database lock was Dec 31, 2019.<h4>Findings</h4>Between March 30, 2015, and Aug 3, 2018, 79 patients were enrolled. 75 patients were assessable. 319 (71%) of the 450 planned courses were delivered. At 1 year from enrolment the primary endpoint was met, 42 patients were progression free (progression-free survival 58%; 95% CI 55-61). 49 patients (65%; 95% CI 54-76) had an objective response after MATRix-RICE, 29 (39%) of whom had a complete response. 37 patients who responded had autologous HSCT. At the end of the programme, 46 patients (61%; 95% CI 51-71) had an objective response, with a median duration of objective response of 26 months (IQR 16-37). At a median follow-up of 29 months (IQR 20-40), 35 patients were progression-free and 33 were alive, with a 2-year overall survival of 46% (95% CI 39-53). Grade 3-4 toxicity was most commonly haematological: neutropenia in 46 (61%) of 75 patients, thrombocytopenia in 45 (60%), and anaemia in 26 (35%). 79 serious adverse events were recorded in 42 (56%) patients; four (5%) of those 79 were lethal due to sepsis caused by Gram-negative bacteria (treatment-related mortality 5%; 95% CI 0\u00b707-9\u00b793).<h4>Interpretation</h4>MATRix-RICE plus autologous HSCT was active in this population of patients with very poor prognosis, and had an acceptable toxicity profile.<h4>Funding</h4>Stand Up To Cancer Campaign for Cancer Research UK, the Swiss Cancer Research foundation, and the Swiss Cancer League.", "affiliation": "Lymphoma Unit, Department of Onco-Hematology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.

Preoperative breast lesion localization is essential for optimizing excision accuracy. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of indocyanine green (ICG) hyaluronic acid injection as a novel mixture for localization.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed a prospective clinical trial with female patients who underwent surgery for non-palpable breast lesions. All patients were sequentially assigned to the control group (localization with activated charcoal), Test Group 1 (ICG-hyaluronic acid mixture 0.1\u00a0mL), or Test Group 2 (ICG-hyaluronic acid mixture 0.2\u00a0mL) by 1:1:1 ratio.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 44 patients were eligible for this study (Control Group\u2009=\u200914, Test Group 1\u2009=\u200915, Test Group 2\u2009=\u200915 patients). Fibroadenoma (n\u2009=\u200917, 38.6%) accounted for the largest proportion of diagnoses, and five patients (11.4%) were diagnosed with malignancies. There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics among the three groups. The marking rate was over 86% in all groups, with no significant intergroup differences. Skin pigmentation was only observed in the control group. The mean accuracy of resection (the greatest diameter of the excised specimen divided by the greatest diameter of the preoperative lesion as observed using ultrasonography, with values closer to 1 reflecting a higher accuracy) was 3.7 in the control group, 2.2 in Test Group 1, and 2.1 in Test Group 2 (p\u2009=\u20090.037 between Controls and Test Group 1, p\u2009=\u20090.744 between Test Group 1 and Test Group 2, and p\u2009=\u20090.026 between Controls and Test Group 2).<h4>Conclusion</h4>ICG-hyaluronic acid injection is a novel method that was shown to accurately localize non-palpable breast lesions and was associated with no skin pigmentation. Further research is required to apply this method to malignant breast lesions.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of indocyanine green (ICG) hyaluronic acid injection as a novel mixture for localization.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed a prospective clinical trial with female patients who underwent surgery for non-palpable breast lesions. All patients were sequentially assigned to the control group (localization with activated charcoal), Test Group 1 (ICG-hyaluronic acid mixture 0.1\u00a0mL), or Test Group 2 (ICG-hyaluronic acid mixture 0.2\u00a0mL) by 1:1:1 ratio.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 44 patients were eligible for this study (Control Group\u2009=\u200914, Test Group 1\u2009=\u200915, Test Group 2\u2009=\u200915 patients). Fibroadenoma (n\u2009=\u200917, 38.6%) accounted for the largest proportion of diagnoses, and five patients (11.4%) were diagnosed with malignancies. There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics among the three groups. The marking rate was over 86% in all groups, with no significant intergroup differences. Skin pigmentation was only observed in the control group. The mean accuracy of resection (the greatest diameter of the excised specimen divided by the greatest diameter of the preoperative lesion as observed using ultrasonography, with values closer to 1 reflecting a higher accuracy) was 3.7 in the control group, 2.2 in Test Group 1, and 2.1 in Test Group 2 (p\u2009=\u20090.037 between Controls and Test Group 1, p\u2009=\u20090.744 between Test Group 1 and Test Group 2, and p\u2009=\u20090.026 between Controls and Test Group 2).<h4>Conclusion</h4>ICG-hyaluronic acid injection is a novel method that was shown to accurately localize non-palpable breast lesions and was associated with no skin pigmentation. Further research is required to apply this method to malignant breast lesions.

pathologic complete response (pCR) is an optimal outcome and a surrogate end point for improved disease-free and overall survival. To date, surgical resection remains the only reliable method for diagnosing pCR.<h4>Objective</h4>To evaluate the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided biopsy for diagnosing a pCR after NAC compared with reference-standard surgical resection.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>Single-arm, phase 1, nonrandomized controlled trial in a single tertiary care cancer center from September 26, 2017, to July 29, 2019. The median follow-up was 1.26 years (interquartile range, 0.85-1.59 years). Data analysis was performed in November 2019. Eligible patients had (1) stage IA to IIIC biopsy-proven operable invasive breast cancer; (2) standard-of-care NAC; (3) MRI before and after NAC, with imaging complete response defined as no residual enhancement on post-NAC MRI; and (4) definitive surgery. Patients were excluded if they were younger than 18 years, had a medical reason precluding study participation, or had a prior history of breast cancer.<h4>Interventions</h4>Post-NAC MRI-guided biopsy without the use of intravenous contrast of the tumor bed before definitive surgery.<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>The primary end point was the negative predictive value of MRI-guided biopsy, with true-negative defined as negative results of the biopsy (ie, no residual cancer) corresponding to a surgical pCR. Accuracy, sensitivity, positive predictive value, and specificity were also calculated. Two clinical definitions of pCR were independently evaluated: definition 1\u2009was no residual invasive cancer; definition 2, no residual invasive or in situ cancer.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty of 23 patients (87%) had evaluable data (median [interquartile range] age, 51.5 [39.0-57.5] years; 20 women [100%]; 13 White patients [65%]). Of the 20 patients, pre-NAC median tumor size on MRI was 3.0 cm (interquartile range, 2.0-5.0 cm). Nineteen of 20 patients (95%) had invasive ductal carcinoma; 15 of 20 (75%) had stage II cancer; 11 of 20 (55%) had ERBB2 (formerly HER2 or HER2/neu)-positive cancer; and 6 of 20 (30%) had triple-negative cancer. Surgical pathology demonstrated a pCR in 13 of 20 (65%) patients and no pCR in 7 of 20 patients (35%) when pCR definition 1 was used. Results of MRI-guided biopsy had a negative predictive value of 92.8% (95% CI, 66.2%-99.8%), with accuracy of 95% (95% CI, 75.1%-99.9%), sensitivity of 85.8% (95% CI, 42.0%-99.6%), positive predictive value of 100%, and specificity of 100% for pCR definition 1. Only 1 patient had a false-negative MRI-guided biopsy result (surgical pathology showed <0.02 cm of residual invasive cancer).<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>This study's results suggest that the accuracy of MRI-guided biopsy to diagnose a post-NAC pCR approaches that of reference-standard surgical resection. MRI-guided biopsy may be a viable alternative to surgical resection for this population after NAC, which supports the need for further investigation.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03289195.", "affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Controlled Clinical Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "research-article", "Clinical Trial, Phase I", "Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": {"grantId": "P30 CA008748", "agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "acronym": "CA", "orderIn": "0"}}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Breast Neoplasms", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "DT", "qualifierName": "drug therapy", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}, {"abbreviation": "PA", "qualifierName": "pathology", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}, {"abbreviation": "SU", "qualifierName": "surgery", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Neoadjuvant Therapy"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Predictive Value of Tests"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Adult"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Female"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Image-Guided Biopsy", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "MT", "qualifierName": "methods", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}}}]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.34045"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7811182"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "N", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "Y", "tmAccessionTypeList": {"accessionType": "nct"}, "dateOfCompletion": "2021-03-16", "dateOfCreation": "2021-01-15", "firstIndexDate": "2021-01-16", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2021-01-23", "dateOfRevision": "2021-03-16", "electronicPublicationDate": "2021-01-04", "firstPublicationDate": "2021-01-04"}, "htmllinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7811182", "abstract": "<h4>Importance</h4>After neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), pathologic complete response (pCR) is an optimal outcome and a surrogate end point for improved disease-free and overall survival.

MRI-guided biopsy may be a viable alternative to surgical resection for this population after NAC, which supports the need for further investigation.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03289195.", "journaltitle": "JAMA network open", "authorinfo": ["Sutton EJ", "Braunstein LZ", "El-Tamer MB", "Brogi E", "Hughes M", "Bryce Y", "Gluskin JS", "Powell S", "Woosley A", "Tadros A", "Sevilimedu V", "Martinez DF", "Toni L", "Smelianskaia O", "Nyman CG", "Razavi P", "Norton L", "Fung MM", "Sedorovich JD", "Sacchini V", "Morris EA"], "title": "Accuracy of Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Biopsy to Verify Breast Cancer Pathologic Complete Response After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: A Nonrandomized Controlled Trial."}, "PMC7925935": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "33550242", "source": "MED", "pmid": "33550242", "pmcid": "PMC7925935", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC7925935"}, "doi": "10.1136/bmjopen-2020-041427", "title": "Study protocol for a single-centre non-inferior randomised controlled trial on a novel three-dimensional matrix positioning-based cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy and software-based fusion-targeted biopsy for the detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer in men without a prior biopsy.", "authorString": "He B, Li R, Li D, Huang L, Wen X, Yang G, Wang H.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "He B", "firstName": "Biming", "lastName": "He", "initials": "B", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-8400-7290"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Urology, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Li R", "firstName": "Rongbing", "lastName": "Li", "initials": "R", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Urology, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Li D", "firstName": "Dongyang", "lastName": "Li", "initials": "D", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Urology, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Huang L", "firstName": "Liqun", "lastName": "Huang", "initials": "L", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Urology, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Wen X", "firstName": "Xiaofei", "lastName": "Wen", "initials": "X", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Urology, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Yang G", "firstName": "Guosheng", "lastName": "Yang", "initials": "G", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Urology, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Wang H", "firstName": "Haifeng", "lastName": "Wang", "initials": "H", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Urology, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China 446720864@qq.com."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-8400-7290"}}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["altmetrics", "supporting_data"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "2", "volume": "11", "journalIssueId": "3104193", "dateOfPublication": "2021 Feb", "monthOfPublication": "2", "yearOfPublication": "2021", "printPublicationDate": "2021-02-01", "journal": {"title": "BMJ open", "ISOAbbreviation": "BMJ Open", "medlineAbbreviation": "BMJ Open", "NLMid": "101552874", "ISSN": "2044-6055", "ESSN": "2044-6055"}}, "pubYear": "2021", "pageInfo": "e041427", "abstractText": "<h4>Introduction</h4>The classical pathway for diagnosing prostate cancer is systematic 12-core biopsy under the guidance of transrectal ultrasound, which tends to underdiagnose the clinically significant tumour and overdiagnose the insignificant disease.

Therefore, new preventive strategies are needed to lower the burden of this disease. Previous studies reported that aspirin could suppress the development of sporadic colorectal adenoma. In addition, metformin is a biguanide derivative that is long widely used for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and has recently been suggested to have a suppressive effect on carcinogenesis and cancer cell growth. Both drugs exhibit a chemopreventive effect, but their efficacy is limited. Aberrant crypt foci (ACF), defined as lesions containing crypts that are larger in diameter and stain more darkly with methylene blue than normal crypts, are more prevalent in patients with cancer and adenomas, and considered a reliable surrogate biomarker of CRC. Thus, we designed a prospective trial as a preliminary study prior to a CRC chemoprevention trial to evaluate the chemopreventive effect of aspirin combined with metformin on colorectal ACF formation in patients scheduled for polypectomy.<h4>Methods</h4>This study is a double-blind randomized controlled trial that will be conducted in patients with both colorectal ACF and colorectal polyps scheduled for polypectomy. Eligible patients will be recruited for the study and the number of ACF in the rectum will be counted at the baseline colonoscopy. Then, the participants will be allocated to one of the following two groups; the aspirin plus placebo group or the aspirin plus metformin group. Patients in the aspirin plus placebo group will receive oral aspirin (100\u2009mg) and placebo for 8\u2009weeks, and those in the aspirin plus metformin group will receive oral aspirin (100\u2009mg) and metformin (250\u2009mg) for 8\u2009weeks. After 8\u2009weeks of administration, polypectomy will be performed to evaluate changes in the number of ACF, and the cell-proliferative activity in the normal colorectal mucosa and colorectal polyps.<h4>Discussion</h4>This is the first study proposed that will explore the effect of aspirin combined with metformin on the formation of colorectal ACF in humans.<h4>Trial registration</h4>This trial has been registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN) Clinical Trials Registry as UMIN000028259 .

However, no biomarkers have been identified to decide which of the drugs is initially used. In this translational research (TR) of the TRICOLORE trial, the advanced colorectal cancer subtype (aCRCS) was analyzed as a potential biomarker for the selection of OX or IRI. We collected 335 (68.8%) formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary tumor specimens from 487 patients registered in the TRICOLORE trial and performed direct sequencing and immunohistochemical staining of CRC-related genes, comprehensive gene-expression analysis, and genome-wide methylation analysis.

However, oesophagectomy is often associated with postoperative morbidity and mortality. Taking into account that modern neoadjuvant therapy is effective and many of patients show no vital tumour cells in the operative specimens, we aim to perform a scoping review as part of the development phase for a prospectively planned multicentre randomised controlled trial investigating 'surgery as needed vs surgery on principle in patients with postneoadjuvant complete response of oesophageal cancer' (Prospective trial registration number DRKS00022801). This scoping approach will allow us to finally define and/or adapt the research question including the design and methodology of the randomised controlled trial taking into account the findings for example, research gaps and/or pitfalls in the currently available study pool addressing this or very similar questions.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>To identify relevant research, we will conduct searches in the electronic databases Medline, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Library and Science Direct. We will also check references of relevant studies and perform a cited reference research (forward citation tracking). Titles and abstracts of the records identified by the searches will be screened and full texts of all potentially relevant articles will be obtained.

However, oesophagectomy is often associated with postoperative morbidity and mortality. Taking into account that modern neoadjuvant therapy is effective and many of patients show no vital tumour cells in the operative specimens, we aim to perform a scoping review as part of the development phase for a prospectively planned multicentre randomised controlled trial investigating 'surgery as needed vs surgery on principle in patients with postneoadjuvant complete response of oesophageal cancer' (Prospective trial registration number DRKS00022801). This scoping approach will allow us to finally define and/or adapt the research question including the design and methodology of the randomised controlled trial taking into account the findings for example, research gaps and/or pitfalls in the currently available study pool addressing this or very similar questions.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>To identify relevant research, we will conduct searches in the electronic databases Medline, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Library and Science Direct. We will also check references of relevant studies and perform a cited reference research (forward citation tracking). Titles and abstracts of the records identified by the searches will be screened and full texts of all potentially relevant articles will be obtained. We will consider randomised trials and non-randomised controlled studies. Data extraction tables will be set up, including study and patients' characteristics, aim of study and reported outcomes.

"<h4>Background</h4>Recent evidence supports hippocampal avoidance with whole brain radiotherapy (HA-WBRT) as the recommended treatment option in patients with good prognosis and multiple brain metastases as this results in better neurocognitive preservation compared to whole brain radiotherapy. However, there is often poor tumour control with this technique due to the low doses given. Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS), a form of focused radiotherapy which is given to patients who have a limited number of brain metastases, delivers a higher radiation dose to the metastases resulting in better target lesion control. With improvements in radiation technology, advanced dose-painting techniques now allow a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) dose to lesions whilst minimising doses to the hippocampus to potentially improve brain tumour control and preserve cognitive outcomes. This technique is abbreviated to HA-SIB-WBRT or HA-WBRT+SIB.<h4>Methods</h4>We hypothesise that the SIB in HA-SIB-WBRT (experimental arm) will result in better tumour control compared to HA-WBRT (control arm). This may also lead to better intracranial disease control as well as functional and survival outcomes. We aim to conduct a prospective randomised phase II trial in patients who have good performance status, multiple brain metastases (4-25 lesions) and a reasonable life expectancy (>\u20096\u2009months). These patients will be stratified according to the number of brain metastases and randomised between the 2 arms. We aim for a recruitment of 100 patients from a single centre over a period of 2\u2009years. Our primary endpoint is target lesion control. These patients will be followed up over the following year and data on imaging, toxicity, quality of life, activities of daily living and cognitive measurements will be collected at set time points. The results will then be compared across the 2 arms and analysed.<h4>Discussion</h4>Patients with brain metastases are living longer. Maintaining functional independence and intracranial disease control is thus increasingly important. Improving radiotherapy treatment techniques could provide better control and survival outcomes whilst maintaining quality of life, cognition and functional capacity. This trial will assess the benefits and possible toxicities of giving a SIB to HA-WBRT.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04452084 .

The high-tech environment and unfamiliar nature of RT can affect the patient's experience of the treatment. Misconceptions or lack of knowledge about RT processes can increase levels of anxiety and enhance feelings of being unprepared at the beginning of treatment. Moreover, the waiting time is often quite long. The primary aim of this study will be to evaluate whether a digital information tool with VR-technology and preparatory information can decrease distress as well as enhance the self-efficacy and health literacy of patients affected by breast cancer before, during, and after RT. A secondary aim will be to explore whether the digital information tool increase patient flow while maintaining or increasing the quality of care.<h4>Method</h4>The study is a prospective and longitudinal RCT study with an Action Research participatory design approach including mixed-methods data collection, i.e., standardised instruments, qualitative interviews (face-to-face and telephone) with a phenomenological hermeneutical approach, diaries, observations, and time measurements, and scheduled to take place from autumn 2020 to spring 2022. The intervention group (n\u2009=\u200980), will receive standard care and information (oral and written) and the digital information tool; and the control group (n\u2009=\u200980), will receive standard care and information (oral and written). Study recruitment and randomisation will be completed at two centres in the west of Sweden.<h4>Discussion</h4>Research in this area is scarce and, to our knowledge, only few previous studies examine VR as a tool for increasing preparedness for patients with breast cancer about to undergo RT that also includes follow-ups six months after completed treatment. The participatory approach and design will safeguard the possibilities to capture the patient perspective throughout the development process, and the RCT design supports high research quality. Digitalisation brings new possibilities to provide safe, person-centred information that also displays a realistic picture of RT treatment and its contexts. The planned study will generate generalisable knowledge of relevance in similar health care contexts.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04394325. Registered May 19, 2020.

The intervention group (n\u2009=\u200980), will receive standard care and information (oral and written) and the digital information tool; and the control group (n\u2009=\u200980), will receive standard care and information (oral and written). Study recruitment and randomisation will be completed at two centres in the west of Sweden.<h4>Discussion</h4>Research in this area is scarce and, to our knowledge, only few previous studies examine VR as a tool for increasing preparedness for patients with breast cancer about to undergo RT that also includes follow-ups six months after completed treatment. The participatory approach and design will safeguard the possibilities to capture the patient perspective throughout the development process, and the RCT design supports high research quality. Digitalisation brings new possibilities to provide safe, person-centred information that also displays a realistic picture of RT treatment and its contexts. The planned study will generate generalisable knowledge of relevance in similar health care contexts.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04394325. Registered May 19, 2020.
