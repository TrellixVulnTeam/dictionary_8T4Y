<p id="Par19">There were 44 eligible patients who were sequentially assigned to the control group, Test Group 1, and Test Group 2 in a 1:1:1 ratio (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the trial flow chart. Screening was done from 3 to 42 preoperative days. All patients underwent history taking, physical examination, chest x-ray, echocardiogram (EKG), mammography (MMG), breast US, and urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) testing. A day or an hour before surgery, US-guided localization was performed by any of four dedicated radiologists. For localization, 0.3 to 1.0 mL of activated charcoal (Charcotrace™, 40 mg/mL) was injected through an 18-gauge needle in the control group. Patients in Test Group 1 and Test Group 2 received 0.1 mL and 0.2 mL, respectively, of ICG-hyaluronic acid mixture through 21-gauge needles. The ICG-hyaluronic acid mixture was in the form of a solution mixed using 0.01 mg of ICG and 4 mg/2 mL hyaluronic acid. Localization with activated charcoal was visualized using the naked eye. Localization with ICG-hyaluronic acid was visualized using near-infrared fluorescence. Each excision was conducted by any of five breast surgeons. Intraoperative photographs were captured before the skin incision, after the skin incision, and after excision (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Each patient underwent a checkup 1 day after surgery, and the last follow-up, including a photograph, occurred between 7 and 17 days after surgery.
