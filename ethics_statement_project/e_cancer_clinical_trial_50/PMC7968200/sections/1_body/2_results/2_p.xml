 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> shows the accuracy of resection for all patients. The mean accuracy in the control group was 3.7 (range, 1.2–13.3). The mean accuracy values in Test Group 1 and Test Group 2 were 2.2 (range, 1.0–4.2) and 2.1 (range 1.0–4.2), respectively. The control group yielded the highest value (reflecting the lowest accuracy) (p = 0.037 between the control group and Test Group 1, p = 0.026 between the control group and Test Group 2, and p = 0.744 between the test groups).
