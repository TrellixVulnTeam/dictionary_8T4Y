<p id="Par25">A total of 44 patients were eligible for this study. The control group had 14 patients and each test group had 15 patients. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the baseline characteristics of the included patients. Most were over 40 years old, and there were no significant intergroup differences in age distribution or mean age. According to the histopathologic results, fibroadenoma (n = 17, 38.6%) accounted for the largest proportion of diagnoses, and five patients (11.4%) were diagnosed with malignant breast lesions. Other diagnostic classifications included fibrocystic changes, inflammation, and fat necrosis. The greatest lesion diameters, as determined via preoperative US were mostly under 2 cm, and there were no significant differences among the three groups. The longest excised specimens were mostly between 2 and 3 cm, and there were no significant intergroup differences. The longest excised specimen was 8 cm; this was a malignant lesion excised from a patient in the control group.
