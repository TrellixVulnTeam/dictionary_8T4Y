<p id="Par27">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> shows the secondary endpoints and AEs in each group. The breast lesion and excised specimen marking rates were over 86% in all groups, and there were no significant intergroup differences. However, skin pigmentation was only observed in the control group (n = 9/14, 64.8%, p = 0.000). Histopathological accuracy was measured by a dedicated histopathologist. There were nine cases for which measurement was impossible during histopathologic examination (n = 9/44, 20.4%); there were fibrocystic changes in three cases, inflammation in one case, intraductal papilloma in two cases, and atypical ductal hyperplasia in one case. The mean histopathologic accuracy values in the control group, Test Group 1, and Test Group 2 were 0.3 (range, 0.1–0.9), 0.4 (range, 0.2–0.8), and 0.4 (range, 0.2–0.9), respectively (p = 0.331 between the control group and Test Group 1, p = 0.914 between the control group and Test Group 2, and p = 0.389 between the test groups). No AEs were observed.
