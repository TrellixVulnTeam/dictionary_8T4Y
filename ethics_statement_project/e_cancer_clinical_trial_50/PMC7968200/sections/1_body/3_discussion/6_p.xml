<p id="Par33">In previous studies, tattooing has been used for various medical purposes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For example, US-guided charcoal tattooing for thyroid cancer has been reported to be safe, easy, and well-tolerated for localizing non-palpable lesions in necks that have previously been operated on, with a high rate of success [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For colorectal surgery, preoperative endoscopic tattooing has been demonstrated to be a safe and highly effective method for localization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The use of charcoal for breast marking has been demonstrated to be safe but associated with pigmentation in many studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. To our knowledge, no published studies have investigated pigmentation rates in terms of dosage. In our study, skin pigmentation occurred in 64.3% of patients in the control group but in none of the patients in the test groups. Tattooing with charcoal could be removed when the excision includes the skin overlying the lesion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], but it is impossible in excisions of small lesions. To avoid pigmentation, localization with ICG-hyaluronic acid could be considered. In previous studies, ICG, which was the active component of the ICG-hyaluronic acid mixture, has already been used for medical purposes. For example, the ICG retention rate at 15 min (ICGR15) is a useful marker of liver function in deciding on the extent of hepatectomy [
