<p id="Par35">This study had several limitations. First, the sample size was small, and there was no long-term follow-up. Second, we used only diameter (cm) without volume (cm3 or mL), which better reflects resection margins [

Third, errors from individual differences could have occurred, in that four radiologists, five surgeons, and three histopathologists participated in localization, surgery, and histopathologic examination, respectively. Even with these limitations, this study was meaningful because it had a prospective design and because there had previously been no research conducted regarding ICG-hyaluronic acid for breast localization.
