  <p>A, Serial section of a primary lesion of gastric neuroendocrine carcinoma with multiple liver metastases (case 3). Immunohistochemical findings revealed tumor cells were diffuse and moderately stained by O
   <sub>6</sub>‚Äêmethylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) protein. This case was defined as intact. B, Serial section of a liver lesion of hepatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (case 9). Immunohistochemical findings revealed tumor cells were not stained by MGMT protein diffusely. This case was defined as deficient. C, Computed tomography findings revealed multiple liver metastases before treatment with temozolomide (case 9). D, Computed tomography findings revealed multiple liver metastases after two treatment cycles with temozolomide. Multiple liver tumors showed remarkable shrinkage (case 9)
