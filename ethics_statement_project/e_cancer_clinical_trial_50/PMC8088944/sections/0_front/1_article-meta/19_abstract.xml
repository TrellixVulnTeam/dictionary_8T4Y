 <p>Extrapulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma (EPNEC) is a lethal disease with a poor prognosis. Platinum‐based chemotherapy is used as the standard first‐line treatment for unresectable EPNEC. Several retrospective studies have reported the results of the utilization of temozolomide (TMZ) as a drug for the second‐line treatment for EPNEC. Patients with unresectable EPNEC that were resistant to platinum‐based combination chemotherapy were recruited for a prospective phase II study of TMZ monotherapy. A 200 mg/m
  <sup>2</sup> dose of TMZ was given from day 1 to day 5, every 4 weeks. Response rate (RR) was evaluated as the primary end‐point. The presence of O
  <sub>6</sub>‐methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) in EPNEC patients was also evaluated as exploratory research. Thirteen patients were enrolled in this study. Primary lesions were pancreas (n = 3), stomach (n = 3), duodenum (n = 1), colon (n = 1), gallbladder (n = 1), liver (n = 1), uterus (n = 1), bladder (n = 1), and primary unknown (n = 1). Each case was defined as pathological poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma from surgically resected and/or biopsied specimens. The median Ki‐67 labeling index was 60% (range, 22%‐90%). The RR was 15.4%, progression‐free survival was 1.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0‐2.7), overall survival (OS) was 7.8 months (95% CI, 6.0‐9.5), and OS from first‐line treatment was 19.2 months (95% CI, 15.1‐23.3). No grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicity had occurred and there was one case of grade 3 nausea. One case presented MGMT deficiency and this case showed partial response. Temozolomide monotherapy is a feasible, modestly effective, and safe treatment for patients with unresectable EPNEC following platinum‐based chemotherapy, especially those with MGMT deficiency.
