 <sup>6</sup>‐methylguanine DNA methyltransferase deficiency was confirmed by IHC analysis, and a case of deficiency in response to TMZ monotherapy was found in this study. Expression of MGMT in tumor cells was assessed as a predictive biomarker for alkylating agents. One mechanism of resistance to alkylating agents is an increase in the expression of the DNA repair enzyme MGMT. If the expression of MGMT is decreased by methylation of the 
 <italic>MGMT</italic> promoter region, DNA repair is decreased. A decrease in MGMT expression, which frequently occurs during carcinogenesis, could increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to alkylating agents that induce DNA damage, thus increasing the response to alkylating agents. Many previous studies have described the relationship between MGMT expression and the response of NENs.

 </xref> In our study, the analysis of the MGMT‐deficient case showed shrinkage of multiple liver tumors after two treatment cycles. However, the tumors rapidly regrew after two cycles. According to another recent study, metronomic TMZ monotherapy (one‐week‐on/one‐week‐off treatment) for pancreatic NEC with MGMT deficiency is a good option for second‐line chemotherapy.

 </xref> We consider TMZ monotherapy as a potential treatment option for EPNEC with MGMT deficiency as a second‐ or third‐line treatment.
