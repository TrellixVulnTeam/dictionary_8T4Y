<p>This study has some limitations. First, the sample size was small, and the primary lesions were heterogeneous. Most prior studies were designed for unresectable pancreatic NEN or GEP‐NEN. Extrapulmonary NEC shows a high degree of heterogeneity, so the efficacy of TMZ could differ according to primary lesions. Second, we evaluated MGMT status using IHC. In a clinical setting, MGMT status can be evaluated by assessing MGMT protein expression using IHC or by determining MGMT promoter methylation using a methylation assay. Some previous reports suggest that concordance is relatively low between IHC and methylation‐specific PCR assessments of MGMT status.
