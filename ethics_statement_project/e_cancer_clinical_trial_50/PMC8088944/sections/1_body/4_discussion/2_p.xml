<p>The activity of TMZ in patients with unresectable NEN has been evaluated in several trials, which showed interesting activity in terms of RR values, ranging from 14% to 70%.

 </xref> However, these clinical data describe TMZ‐based chemotherapy for mainly well‐to‐moderately differentiated NETs (WHO 2019: grade1 and/or grade 2). Primary pancreatic NET shows a good response (43%–70%) to TMZ therapy with a long PFS rate (12‐18 months).

 </xref> Recently, in a prospective randomized phase II study for pancreatic NET (G1 or G2) with TMZ monotherapy vs capecitabine and TMZ combination chemotherapy, the response rate was 33.3% vs 27.8%, respectively, and the PFS was 22.7 months vs 14.4 months. Temozolomide and capecitabine combination chemotherapy shows a significantly better PFS than TMZ monotherapy.

 </xref> The ENETS consensus guidelines describing TMZ‐based chemotherapy should be considered for well‐differentiated NEN, including NET G3.
