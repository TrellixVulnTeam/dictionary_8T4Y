<p>Our study revealed that salvage‐line TMZ monotherapy was a safe and marginally effective treatment for patients with unresectable EPNEC after failure of first‐line platinum‐based chemotherapy. We consider TMZ monotherapy as a potential treatment option for EPNEC with MGMT deficiency as a second‐ or third‐line treatment. A more effective second‐line treatment option is necessary for EPNEC, but chemotherapy with TMZ combined with another agent could serve as a feasible and effective treatment option for EPNEC treatment, especially in the presence of MGMT deficiency.</p>
