<p>To date, there has been no established second‐line chemotherapy for EPNEC. Oxaliplatin‐based chemotherapy, irinotecan‐based chemotherapy and retreatment with platinum‐based chemotherapy is retrospectively used as second‐line chemotherapy; however, the response rate is 17%‐40% and the PFS is only 1.9‐4.8 months.
