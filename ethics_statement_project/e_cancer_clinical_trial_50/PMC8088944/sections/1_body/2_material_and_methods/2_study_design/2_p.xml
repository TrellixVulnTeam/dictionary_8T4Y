<p>A phase II study using TMZ monotherapy as a second‐line treatment in patients with unresectable EPNEC resistant to platinum‐based chemotherapy was carried out from April 2013 to March 2017 (UMIN000010549) (IRB B130307033 and B160101021). Temozolomide was not approved for EPNEC by Japanese insurance support; therefore, we informed the efficacy, side‐effects, and financial support organization for this clinical trial and obtained consent from all patients. Drug supply and funding support were provided by the Advanced Treatment Supportive Organization at Yokohama City University Hospital. This trial finished before March 2017; therefore, it did not meet the specifications of a special clinical trial.</p>
