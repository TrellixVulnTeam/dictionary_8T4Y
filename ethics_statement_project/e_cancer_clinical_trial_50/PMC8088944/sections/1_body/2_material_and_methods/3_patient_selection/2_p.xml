<p>Patients with pathologically confirmed, metastatic, or recurrent poorly differentiated NEC (WHO 2010 Ki‐67 labeling index greater than 20% for grade 3 tumors), who were previously treated with platinum‐based first‐line chemotherapy, were eligible for this study if they met the following inclusion criteria: ECOG PS of 0 or 1; age between 20 and 75 years; EPNEC with at least one measurable lesion based on RECIST; and adequate hematological, liver, and renal function (hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL, white blood cell count &lt;10 000/mm
 <sup>3</sup> and &gt;3000/mm
 <sup>3</sup>, neutrophil count &gt;1500/mm
 <sup>3</sup>, platelet count &gt;100 000/mm
 <sup>3</sup>, total bilirubin less than 1.5‐fold the upper normal limit, serum transaminase less than three‐fold the upper normal limit, and creatinine less than 1.5‐fold the upper normal limit). The patients provided written informed consent. We excluded primary lung cancer (eg, SCLC and LCNEC), pathological diagnosis of mixed neuroendocrine neoplasm, adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine features, and well‐differentiated neuroendocrine tumor, so‐called NET G3.
