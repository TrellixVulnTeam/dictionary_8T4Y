<p>Immunohistochemistry was undertaken on formalin‐fixed, paraffin‐embedded tissue sections. We reacted 4‐μm‐thick sections of representative blocks with mAbs against MGMT (MT 3.1; 1:25, GeneTex). Nuclear MGMT expression was scored as either intact or deficient in tumor cells.

 </xref> Tumors were scored as intact when nuclear staining for MGMT was observed in any of the tumor cells. Tumors were scored as deficient when nuclear staining for MGMT was not observed in any tumor cells. Nonneoplastic cells served as an internal positive control in all tissue sections.
