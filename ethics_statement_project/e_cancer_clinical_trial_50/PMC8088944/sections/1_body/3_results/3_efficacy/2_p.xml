<p>A total of 28 cycles of TMZ were completed, and the median number of cycles per patient was two (range, 1‐4). The RR was 15.4% and disease control rate was 23.1% (complete response = 0, partial response = 2, stable disease = 1, progressive disease = 10) (Table 
 <xref rid="cas14811-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Progression‐free survival was 1.8 months (95% CI, 1.0‐2.7) and OS was 7.8 months (95% CI, 6.0‐9.5) months. Overall survival from first‐line treatment was 19.2 months (95% CI, 15.1‐23.3) (Figures 
 <xref rid="cas14811-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="cas14811-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In previously reported studies, high proliferation cases were highly responsive to platinum‐based chemotherapy. Therefore, we separated patients into two groups according to Ki‐67 labeling index: high proliferation group, Ki‐67 50% or higher; and low proliferation group, Ki‐67 less than 50%. Partial response was achieved in two cases (22.2%) in the high proliferation group. There was no response in the low proliferation group. However, PFS (high proliferation group, 1.8 months; 95% CI, 2.0‐1.7 months vs low proliferation group, 0.8 months; 95% CI, 2.1‐0 months; log rank 
 <italic>P</italic> = .488), and OS was not significantly different in these two groups (high proliferation group 7.8 months; 95% CI, 10.2‐5.3 months vs low proliferation group 7.1 months; 95% CI, 12.9‐1.4 months; log rank 
 <italic>P</italic> = .739).
