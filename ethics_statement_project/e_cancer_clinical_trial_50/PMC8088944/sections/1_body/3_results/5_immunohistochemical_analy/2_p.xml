<p>Formalin‐fixed, paraffin‐embedded tissue sections were obtained from all cases. Sufficient tissues for immunohistochemical analysis could not be obtained from two cases. As a result, 11 tissue samples were analyzed in total (Table 
 <xref rid="cas14811-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Ten cases were found to be intact and one case was found to be deficient (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas14811-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3A,B</xref>). The deficient case had a primary liver NEC with multiple liver metastases and temporarily achieved a partial response (Figure
