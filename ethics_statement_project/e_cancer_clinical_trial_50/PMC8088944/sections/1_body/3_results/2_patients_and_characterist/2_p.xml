<p>Between April 2013 and March 2017, 13 patients were enrolled in this study. Table 
 <xref rid="cas14811-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the patient characteristics at baseline. The median age of patients was 65 years (range, 40‐75 years). Six patients were male and seven were female. Three patients had a PS of 1, and 10 cases had a PS of 0. All cases showed metastatic and unresectable EPNEC. Four patients underwent surgical resection of the tumor prior to treatment. The first‐line chemotherapy regimens were irinotecan + cisplatin (n = 8), cisplatin + etoposide (n = 4), and carboplatin + etoposide (n = 1). Primary lesions were classified as pancreas (n = 3), stomach (n = 3), duodenum (n = 1), colon (n = 1), gallbladder (n = 1), liver (n = 1), uterus (n = 1), bladder (n = 1), and primary unknown (n = 1). The median Ki‐67 labeling index was 60% (range, 22%‐90%).
