Platinum-based chemotherapy is used as the standard first-line treatment for unresectable EPNEC. Several retrospective studies have reported the results of the utilization of temozolomide (TMZ) as a drug for the second-line treatment for EPNEC. Patients with unresectable EPNEC that were resistant to platinum-based combination chemotherapy were recruited for a prospective phase II study of TMZ monotherapy. A 200\u00a0mg/m<sup>2</sup> dose of TMZ was given from day 1 to day 5, every 4\u00a0weeks. Response rate (RR) was evaluated as the primary end-point. The presence of O<sub>6</sub> -methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) in EPNEC patients was also evaluated as exploratory research. Thirteen patients were enrolled in this study.
