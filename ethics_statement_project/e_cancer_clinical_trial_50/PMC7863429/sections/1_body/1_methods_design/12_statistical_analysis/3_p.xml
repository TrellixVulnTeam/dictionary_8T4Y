<p id="Par111">Primary Endpoint Analysis: Progression Free Survival PFS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of the first objective progression accordingly to RECIST or death (whatever its cause in the absence of progression). Patients without progression and alive at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest assessment. The primary analysis will take place when 106 events have been observed. This analysis will use the logrank test, stratified on the primary location and the time of onset of the bone metastases (synchronous vs metachronous). Cox regression model will also be used to perform a sensitivity analysis taking into account the usual prognostic factors. The hazard ratio will be given with its 95% confidence interval. A 
 <italic>p</italic> value &lt;= 0.05 will be considered as statistically significant. A secondary analysis will also be performed, using the Fine and Gray model in order to take into account the competing risks (relapse in the bone, relapse in another site, death), and so to analyse the impact of the different PFS events on the trial results.
