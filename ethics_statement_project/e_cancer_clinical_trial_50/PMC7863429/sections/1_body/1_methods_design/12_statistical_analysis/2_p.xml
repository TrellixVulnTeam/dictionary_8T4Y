<p id="Par110">Data analysis: All patients will be randomized after completion of the primary tumor treatment for synchronous or metachronous metastasis. The randomization will be stratified by date of metastasis (synchronous vs. metachronous) and primary tumor site (breast vs. non-small cell lung vs. prostate cancer). Statistical analysis will be performed on all the randomized patients, accordingly to the intent to treat (ITT) arm, whatever the actually received treatment. Patients without progression and alive at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest assessment.</p>
