<p id="Par112">An Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), with expertise and experience in the pathology, and without direct involvement in the conduct of the trial, will be set up specifically to guarantee effective protection of patients, insure the ethical conduct of the trial, benefit/risk ratio of the trial, and to ensure the independent review of the scientific results during the trial and at the end of the trial. The DSMC will meet after 60 patients are accrued in the experimental arm to review toxicity outcomes and compliance.</p>
