<p id="Par43">The sample size allows 2 stratification factors at randomization: date of metastases (synchronous vs metachronous) and primary tumor site (prostate vs breast vs lung). All patients will be randomized after completion of the primary tumor treatment for synchronous or metachronous metastasis. The randomization will be minimized by the following stratification factors. Minimization aims to ensure treatment arms are balanced with respect to predefined patient factors as well as for the number of patients in each group.</p>
