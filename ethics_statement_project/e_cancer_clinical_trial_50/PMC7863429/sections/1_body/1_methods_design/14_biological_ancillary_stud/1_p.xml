<p id="Par114">The follow-up of bone metastasis evaluation is difficult by means of anatomic imaging (CT-scan). There is a need to identify biologic markers that would predict bone disease progression (DP) and risk of skeletal-related events (SREs) as sequelae of bone metastases. As this ancillary study, we have chosen to explore s-CTX and bone alkaline phosphatase (b-ALP) to better quantify response to SBRT vs standard treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Predictive value of these biomarkers at different points will be assessed on disease control rate (DCR) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. To perform this study, blood samples (sCTX and bALP: 7 ml in a dry tube will be collected before the beginning of treatment, at the end of treatment, at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year after randomization.
