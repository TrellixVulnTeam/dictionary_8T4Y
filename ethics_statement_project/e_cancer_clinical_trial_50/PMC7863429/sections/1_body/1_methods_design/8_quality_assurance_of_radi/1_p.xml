<p id="Par103">In order to ensure patient safety and effective treatment delivery, a quality assurance protocol is implemented. Prior to opening the study, each participant centre will have to validate a dummy run by delineate targets and OARs and produce a treatment plan from a benchmark case on Aquilab software. The Quality Assurance committee will evaluate the dummy run. Patient inclusions by a centre will be allowed only after full validation. Afterwards, each participating centre will have to send planning and contouring information for the first included patient for review before the start of the radiotherapy. The QA committee according to the protocol recommendations in terms of delineation, dose constraints and treatment workflow will evaluate this treatment plan. At the end of treatment, each participating centre will have to send final review of the RT data for all included patients in SBRT arm for review. The QA committee, according to the protocol recommendations in terms of delineation, dose constraints and treatment workflow will evaluate the treatment plan for Quality Assurance.</p>
