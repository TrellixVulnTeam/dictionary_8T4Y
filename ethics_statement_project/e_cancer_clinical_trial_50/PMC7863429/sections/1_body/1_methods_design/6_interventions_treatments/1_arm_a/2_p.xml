<p id="Par87">All patients in Arm A will undergo planning CT simulation. CT simulation must be performed in the treatment position with adequate immobilization devices and the fiducials must be placed for stereotactic targeting if necessary. The use of intravenous contrast is recommended. Axial reconstructions will be required with slice thickness of around 1â€‰mm. MRI, and PET if needed will be merged with CT simulation at the target volume on the simulation CT.</p>
