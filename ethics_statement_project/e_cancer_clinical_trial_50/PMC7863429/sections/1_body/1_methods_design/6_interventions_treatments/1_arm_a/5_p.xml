<p id="Par90">The PTV is obtained by adding a margin around the CTV to take into account the set-up uncertainty during radiotherapy delivery with PTV = CTV + 2 mm. This margin can be reduced to 0 mm close to the spinal cord. Depending on the SBRT equipment, the beam aperture can be set to 2–3 mm beyond the CTV to provide adequate dose coverage. This margin can be reduced to 0–1 mm close to the spinal cord.</p>
