<p id="Par35">Patients with oligometastatic disease have improved survival compared with those with high- volume metastatic disease. While systemic treatment is the standard of care. Stereotactic radiotherapy is a highly accurate technique initially developed for performing the radiosurgery of lesion in patients for whom it was deemed be to difficult to proceed to classical excision surgery. In the context of patients with oligo-metastatic cancer, high doses of radiation in stereotactic conditions can be safely delivered in bone metastases with increased probability of local control. Local control of bone metastasis is similar to than other localizations with a good control of pain [
