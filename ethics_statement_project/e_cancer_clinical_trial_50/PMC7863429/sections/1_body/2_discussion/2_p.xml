<p id="Par117">The tools required for high precision radiotherapy are now commercially available and implemented in many radiotherapy departments. Sufficient clinical experience has been acquired so that large randomized trials can confidently be launched. Current knowledge is mainly based on retrospective and prospectives non-randomized studies, thus suffering from heterogeneous population and inappropriate sample power. The oligometastatic concept has been developed in the last years and recent trials show interesting results on adding Metastase Directed Treatment (MDT) (such as radiotherapy or surgery) at standard therapy. However, despite encouraging data, some authors remain skeptical that MDT will delay the use of systemic treament.</p>
