<p id="Par120">In a recent review of Faiez Al-Shafa et al., on Ongoing Trials of Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy for Oligometastatic Cancers, A minority of trials were randomized in design (
 <italic>n</italic> = 17, 27%). While most studies allowed for metastases from multiple primary disease sites (
 <italic>n</italic> = 22, 34%), the most common was prostate (
 <italic>n</italic> = 13, 15%), followed by breast, gastrointestinal, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and renal (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6, 9% each). In studies with a solitary target site, the most common was liver (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6, 9%) followed by lung (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3, 5%). The most common primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) (
 <italic>n</italic> = 20, 31%) and toxicity (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10, 16%). A combined strategy of systemic therapy and SABR was an emerging theme (
 <italic>n</italic> = 23, 36%), with more recent studies specifically evaluating SABR and immunotherapy (
 <italic>n</italic> = 9, 14%) [
