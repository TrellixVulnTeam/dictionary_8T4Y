<p id="Par14">Patients with type 2 diabetes who were prescribed metformin have been reported to be at a low risk of cancer development, including CRC), compared with those who were not treated with metformin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This evidence suggests that metformin might be a candidate agent for CRC chemoprevention in diabetic patients. In previous studies, we demonstrated the chemopreventive effect of metformin in two rodent models (a genetic model and a chemically-induced cancer model) and two human studies of colorectal carcinogenesis. We demonstrated that metformin inhibited the development of intestinal polyps in adenomatous polyposis coli mice, a murine model of familial adenomatous polyposis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Both studies were conducted in nondiabetic mice, which suggested the direct chemopreventive potential of metformin per se. We also conducted a trial involving non-diabetic human patients and showed that oral low-dose metformin (250â€‰mg/day) was safe and suppressed the formation of colorectal ACF. In the study conducted on nondiabetic human subjects, the drug was safe [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In that trial, we showed the safety and chemopreventive effect of metformin on colorectal carcinogenesis. However, similar to aspirin, the chemopreventive effective was limited.
