<p id="Par13">Cancer is a major health concern and the leading cause of death worldwide. The incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC) continues to increase worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Most cases of CRC originate from adenomas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and their removal has been shown to reduce the risk of future development of CRC and advanced adenoma [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], thereby preventing CRC-related death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, patients with adenomas and CRC constitute a high-risk group for the development of metachronous colorectal adenoma and/or CRC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, a paradigm shift from surveillance for the early detection of cancer or adenomas and polypectomy to new tactics for prevention, including chemoprevention, is required to lower the burden of this disease. Several large epidemiologic and clinical studies have evaluated the possible effects of more than 200 agents, including fiber, calcium, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, in protecting against CRC development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Previous studies reported that aspirin suppressed the development of sporadic colorectal adenoma [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, the chemopreventive effect of aspirin is limited, and these studies also reported that aspirin increased gastrointestinal bleeding. In these patients, a post-aspirin chemoprevention drug is then needed to establish CRC chemoprevention.
