<p id="para0022">PREVENT-HD is being conducted at up to approximately 15 sites affiliated with integrated health care delivery networks in the United States. The trial is sponsored by Janssen Research and Development, LLC (Raritan, NJ) and conducted in partnership with CPC Clinical Research (CPC; Aurora, CO), a nonprofit Academic Research Organization that is affiliated with the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. An Executive Committee (EC) is responsible for oversight of the study with unrestricted access to the necessary data to fulfill this role and will submit the results of the study for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. CPC provides administrative support to the EC, and IDMC, and helps to oversee consistency in site end point confirmation. REDCap Cloud provided oversight for defining the EMR data fields to be collected from each site and for establishing the necessary technical connections for the integration/transfer of EMR data from sites to REDCap Cloud to the study database. No direct funding was provided to support development of the current manuscript. The authors are solely responsible for drafting and editing of the manuscript, and its final contents.</p>
