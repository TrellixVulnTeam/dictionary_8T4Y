<p id="para0021">An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) is responsible for monitoring the safety of study participants throughout the trial and will perform a minimum of one interim analysis for futility or overwhelming superiority once approximately 50% of the required 333 first primary efficacy events have been observed. The stopping rule for overwhelming superiority uses an O'Brien-Fleming boundary (Z = 2.96, alpha = 0.003) approach. The IDMC may consider additional factors and request additional interim analyses (with appropriate apportionment of alpha to control the type 1 error rate) to make decisions on trial conduct.</p>
