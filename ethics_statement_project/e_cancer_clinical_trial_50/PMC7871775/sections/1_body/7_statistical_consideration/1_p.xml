<p id="para0019">Efficacy analyses will be conducted on all randomized patients using the principle of intention-to-treat up to day 35 after randomization; safety analyses will be conducted on all patients that received at least one dose of study drug until 2 days after the last dose of study medication. Treatment assignment will be balanced within a clinical site by block randomization. The randomization will be stratified by the time from COVID-19 positive test to randomization (1-5 days inclusive, 6-14 days inclusive). The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the time from randomization to the first adjudicated occurrence of any component of the primary composite end point up to day 35. The primary efficacy analysis will be done using a stratified log-rank test by the time from COVID-19 positive test to randomization with the treatment as a variable. The primary efficacy outcome will be tested at a 2-sided significance level of 5%, with appropriate apportioning of alpha to account for one planned interim analysis. Secondary end points will be analyzed hierarchically, in the order listed in 
 <xref rid="tbl0003" ref-type="table">TableÂ 3</xref>, using similar time-to-event analyses described above.
