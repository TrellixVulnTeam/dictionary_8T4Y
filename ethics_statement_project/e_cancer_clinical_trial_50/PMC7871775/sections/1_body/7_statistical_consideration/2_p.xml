<p id="para0020">The trial is event-driven such that it would require 333 confirmed first primary end point events to detect an anticipated hazard ratio of 0.70 between the study arms, with 90% power at a 2-sided 5% significance level. It was determined that the study required approximately 4,000 participants in order to have 333 patients experience a component of the primary end point over 35 days with a placebo rate of the primary outcome of 10%. If the blinded, pooled event rate proves to be lower than anticipated, enrollment of up to 5,000 participants will be considered (corresponding to an event rate in the placebo group of 7.8%, all else constant) to achieve the requisite number of events. The estimate for primary outcome event rate was estimated from unpublished data from the Northwell system (Spyropoulos AC, personal communication) suggesting a 10% hospitalization rate in unselected patients, and CDC information suggesting approximately 8% nationally in patients 18 years of age and older. The case fatality rate for unselected patients is approximately 2.3% nationally. It was also assumed that most, but not all thromboembolic events and deaths might occur after hospitalization.
