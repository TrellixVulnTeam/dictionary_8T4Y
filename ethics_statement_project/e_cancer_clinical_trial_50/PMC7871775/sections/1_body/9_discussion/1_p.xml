 </xref> Rapidly developing therapeutic strategies to address these risks pose a specific challenge in an environment where traditional randomized trial models are impractical and pose safety issues such as exposure to infected individuals. Such challenges may foster variability in care and a desire to utilize non-randomized data to guide treatment with such approaches associated with important limitations.
