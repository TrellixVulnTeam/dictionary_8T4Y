 </xref> This timeline was facilitated by FDA review that was both expedited and accepting of a study design which emphasizes avoidance of in-person contact. The remote electronic consent process, home drug delivery, and virtual follow-up contacts allows participants with this often physically taxing and contagious disease to continue home quarantine and convalescence throughout the trial. Fully remote site monitoring further reduces interpersonal contact at the study sites. The elimination of physical contacts helps to protect the local communities from exposure to the virus and minimizes the burden and risks to a medically fragile participant population with COVID-19. Finally, PREVENT-HD gains further efficiencies by leveraging the infrastructure of integrated health care delivery network, which serves to expand the pool of patients available to recruit from while concentrating start-up activities to fewer sites (eg, contract execution, collection of regulatory documents, and implementation of training). Integration between the local EMR and the clinical database brings key data on prospective and enrolled participants immediately to the attention of the study team. The creation of a parallel dataset of selected EMR data will further enable investigation of the reliability of EMR data and determine if efficiencies can be gained by reducing or eliminating the need for manual transcription of select study data to the primary clinical study database. Site-level adjudication of end point events allows direct access to full EMR records and minimizes the site burdens of medical record collection, redaction, and central submission processing.
