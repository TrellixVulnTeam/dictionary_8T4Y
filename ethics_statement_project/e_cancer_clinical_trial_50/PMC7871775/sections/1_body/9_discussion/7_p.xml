<p id="para0030">If rivaroxaban can provide thromboembolic benefits in the outpatient COVID-19 population, another important question to be answered by PREVENT-HD is whether this benefit comes at an unacceptably elevated risk of bleeding. A disseminated intravascular coagulation-like picture can be seen late in COVID-19; while this pattern of laboratory abnormalities can be associated with a bleeding diathesis, bleeding complications in COVID-19 are generally infrequent.

 </xref> Additionally, immune thrombocytopenia has been reported in COVID-19 and can also increase the risk of bleeding.

 </xref> At this point, these potential bleeding risks appear to be uncommon in the population targeted for enrollment in PREVENT-HD, and subjects with known or expected high risk of bleeding will be excluded from the trial. Nevertheless, net clinical benefit in the outpatient population will be important to characterize.
