<p id="para0028">In addition to the innovative approach, PREVENT HD seeks to answer an important scientific question in COVID-19. While most research is currently focused on the role of anticoagulation in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, it is possible that decreasing thrombotic risk earlier in the course of disease may prevent some aspects of disease progression and pulmonary injury such as microvascular thrombosis. PREVENT-HD is one of a limited number of placebo-controlled trials registered on clinicaltrials.gov examining antithrombotic interventions in outpatients with COVID-19. A smaller trial (
 <italic>n</italic> = 600) is also evaluating rivaroxaban versus placebo in outpatients (NCT04504032), while one larger outpatient primary thromboprophylaxis trial (the OVID trial, NCT04400799) is comparing enoxaparin 40 mg SQ daily versus placebo (
 <italic>N</italic> = 1000).
