<p id="para0031">A potential concern is completing an outpatient trial in COVID-19 with rapidly-shifting self-prevention practices, improved COVID-19 therapeutics, and the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. However, there are currently limited therapeutic options for slowing disease progression in the outpatient setting; therefore, the primary outcome, which includes hospitalization, should be robust to these evolving social factors. Furthermore, vaccine distribution and administration may leave significant proportions of the population vulnerable over the next 1 to 2 years. Knowledge of therapeutic approaches to minimize morbidity and relieve stress on inpatient services will remain critical.</p>
