<p id="para0014">Participants are randomized on study Day 1 and will take blinded study medication once daily through to study Day 35. All study activities will occur remotely, including screening for eligibility, consent, and follow-up. Following randomization, participants are automatically flagged for drug dispensation through an automated system. A centralized drug depot sends study drug directly to the patient's home by the next day. Delivery is confirmed by telephone contact on Day 3. To further minimize potential study related COVID-19 exposures, subjects receive detailed instructions for safe self-disposal of any unused study drug rather than being required to return drug to the site.</p>
