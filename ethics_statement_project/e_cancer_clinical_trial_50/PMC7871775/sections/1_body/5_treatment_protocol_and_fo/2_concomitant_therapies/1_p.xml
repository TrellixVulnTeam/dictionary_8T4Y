<p id="para0013">The protocol allows treatment with all clinically-recommended therapies according to local practice, including any prescribed medications intended to inhibit SARS Co-V-2 activity. Drugs that interact with rivaroxaban to either significantly increase or decrease rivaroxaban concentrations are prohibited; such medications include combined P-glycoprotein and strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, or combined P-glycoprotein and strong CYP3A4 inducers. Of importance, dexamethasone, commonly used in the treatment of COVID-19, is not a prohibited medication. Medications that significantly increase the risk of bleeding in the setting of rivaroxaban therapy, such as anticoagulants, dual antiplatelet regimens, or high-dose antiplatelet monotherapy (eg, aspirin &gt;162 mg daily, clopidogrel &gt;75 mg daily, or ticlopidine &gt;250 mg daily), are also prohibited. Single antiplatelet agents including these drugs at lower doses, ticagrelor, and prasugrel are allowed, with the caution that participants should be monitored for increased risk of bleeding. If any prohibited medication is clinically indicated, blinded study drug is to be discontinued while the prohibited medication is taken.</p>
