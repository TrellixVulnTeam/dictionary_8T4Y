<p id="para0016">The EMR domains selected for the pilot study were purposely chosen to be generic and applicable to future clinical studies (eg, health care or hospital encounters, demographics, medications, labs, prior medical, or surgical diagnoses). This component of the trial is intended to explore new methods of data acquisition that may expand central monitoring capabilities and improve the efficiency of site monitoring by reducing or eliminating the requirement to perform on-site or remote source data verification. The pilot will also explore whether EMR data can replace manual transcription of study data into the clinical database for selected fields. For this study, all data will also be manually entered by site personnel into a conventional electronic data capture system for regulatory purposes and to allow for comparisons.</p>
