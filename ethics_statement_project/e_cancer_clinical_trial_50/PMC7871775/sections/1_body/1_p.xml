<p id="para0005">While acknowledging the potential benefit of post-hospitalization thromboprophylaxis, expert opinion and guidance statements have disagreed on the need for primary thromboprophylaxis in outpatients with COVID-19 with thrombotic risk factors.

 </xref> A key question is: when in the course of SARS-Co-V-2 infection does thrombotic risk reach a critical, yet modifiable point? There are data supporting activated thrombin as a key pathogenetic driver of pulmonary compromise in COVID-19. Fibrinogen and D-dimer concentrations are often already elevated at the time of hospital admission,

 </xref> We hypothesize that the increased risk of thrombotic events, attributable to a thrombotic-inflammatory status associated with reduced mobility, begins prior to severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19, and includes patients who do not require hospitalization. Multiple autopsy series have reported venous thromboembolism and widespread pulmonary microthrombi in decedents with COVID-19,

 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref> ). Therefore, we hypothesize that intervening to decrease thrombotic risk earlier in the course of COVID-19, especially in patients with known risk factors for thrombosis, will significantly decrease thrombotic complications and reduce disease progression to the point where hospitalization could be avoided.
