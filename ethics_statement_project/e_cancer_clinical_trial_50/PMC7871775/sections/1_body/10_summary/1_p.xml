<p id="para0032">Patients with COVID-19 are at an increased risk of venous and arterial thrombotic events, and this tendency for thrombosis may play an important role in disease progression requiring hospitalization. The role of prophylactic anticoagulation in the pre-hospital setting has not yet been established. PREVENT-HD is a pragmatic trial, with innovative design features to respond to needs in the context of an infectious pandemic and beyond. This trial will evaluate, in symptomatic outpatients with COVID-19 with at least one additional thrombotic risk factor who are at low risk for bleeding, the efficacy and safety of the 10mg once daily dose of rivaroxaban to reduce thrombotic events, hospitalizations, and mortality.</p>
