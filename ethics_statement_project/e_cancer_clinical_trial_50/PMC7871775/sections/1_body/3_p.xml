 </xref> Outpatients with COVID-19 may represent a similar medically ill population that could benefit from thromboprophylaxis with rivaroxaban, but the need for, and the net clinical benefit of, anticoagulation at an early stage of COVID-19 is currently unknown. Given the potential role of factor Xa in the pathogenesis of coronavirus morbidity and mortality, rivaroxaban may have benefits in preventing the progression to severe COVID-19.

 </xref> The PREVENT-HD trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of prophylactic-dose rivaroxaban in outpatients with symptomatic COVID-19 infection with at least one additional thrombotic risk factor.
