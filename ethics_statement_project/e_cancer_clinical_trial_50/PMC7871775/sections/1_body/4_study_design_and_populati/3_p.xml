<p id="para0010">Subjects are identified through site specific EMR searches to notify coordinators of potential subjects having a recent positive test result for COVID-19. At some sites, such searches are supplemented with additional inclusion and exclusion criteria verifiable through the EMR. Potential subjects are then called to verify eligibility and to assess interest. Consent is generally obtained electronically, while the site communicates directly by phone or by virtual meeting platforms. For some participants unable to provide consent electronically, the consent is verified using paper forms.</p>
