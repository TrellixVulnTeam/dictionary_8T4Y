<p id="para0008">PREVENT-HD is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pragmatic, event-driven phase 3 study to assess the efficacy of rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily in preventing venous and arterial thrombotic events, hospitalization, and death in outpatients with symptomatic COVID-19. The trial is being conducted at large integrated health care delivery networks to facilitate centralized patient recruitment and follow-up, and to enable a pilot study of alternative methods of data collection through integration of a cloud-based data capture tool with electronic medical records (EMR). The study design incorporates several innovative processes intended to reduce exposure of health care providers to SARS Co-V-2, monitor the safety of study participants, and enhance the efficiency of study conduct using advanced informatics integration (
