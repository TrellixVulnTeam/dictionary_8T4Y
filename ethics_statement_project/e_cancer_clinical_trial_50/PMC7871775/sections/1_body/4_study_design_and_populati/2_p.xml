<p id="para0009">The inclusion criteria are designed to enroll a representative population of symptomatic adult outpatients with COVID-19 with at least one additional risk factor for thrombosis and with a low bleeding risk, and for whom the initial treatment plan does not include hospitalization. Study participants must be at least 18 years of age, have documented COVID-19, have symptoms attributable to COVID-19, and have an additional risk factor for venous or arterial thromboembolic disease, including elevated D-dimer level, thrombophilia, prior venous thromboembolism, history of cancer, coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, cerebrovascular disease or ischemic stroke; or a risk factor associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes (age ≥60 years of age, body mass index ≥35 kg/m
 <sup>2</sup>, or history of heart failure or diabetes requiring medication). Key exclusion criteria include convalescent infection (eg, positive COVID antibody test or other serology test at least 2 weeks following acute infection), conditions that pose an increased risk of bleeding (eg, bronchiectasis, active cancer undergoing treatment, active gastroduodenal ulcer, significant bleeding in the prior 3 months and use of dual antiplatelet therapy),
