<p id="para0011">Participants meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria may be randomized from the date of the positive COVID-19 test until 14 days later, inclusive. All participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either rivaroxaban 10 mg or matching oral placebo once daily for 35 days through use of a central computerized interactive voice/web response system that conceals study drug assignment from investigators. Randomization will be further stratified by the time from positive diagnostic of COVID-19 test to randomization, into an early-dosed cohort (1-5 days) and a later-dosed cohort (6-14 days). The protocol also allows capping of enrollment of participants with certain risk factors to enable an adequate assessment of subgroups with particular risk factors. Enrollment began in August 2020 and will continue to an expected total of approximately 4,000 participants randomized to achieve the target number of end point events. The study is being performed in accordance with all local laws and regulations, and with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and the International Council on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The study protocol and informed consent have been reviewed and approved by the responsible health authorities and Institutional Review Boards for all participating study sites.</p>
