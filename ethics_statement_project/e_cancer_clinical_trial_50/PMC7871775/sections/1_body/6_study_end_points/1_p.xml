<p id="para0017">The primary efficacy end point is a composite including symptomatic VTE, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, non-central nervous system (non-CNS) systemic embolization, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality up to Day 35. Because many of the components of this end point are typically associated with hospitalization, the study end point represents significant morbidities that are meaningful to an outpatient population. Secondary and exploratory efficacy end points are further listed in 
 <xref rid="tbl0003" ref-type="table">TableÂ 3</xref> and include emergency department visits and need for supplemental oxygen therapy. The primary safety end point is fatal and critical-site bleeding according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis definition. Additional safety end points will include International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis major bleeding and nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding.
