<p id="para0018">All primary end points and most secondary end points will undergo adjudication against trial end point definitions by trained, experienced physicians at each site who remain blinded to treatment assignment. To participate as a physician adjudicator, individuals must undergo additional training on the application of standardized event definitions. Adjudicators are instructed to contact the academic research organization for questions related to complicated cases or unanticipated circumstances, which are then logged as conventions to be applied to future cases across sites. This model of site-level adjudication allows for efficiency gains by taking advantage of full access to local EMR systems for source document review. All end point definitions used in PREVENT-HD are provided in the Appendix. Centralized oversight of local adjudicators is conducted through centralized training, use of conventions, and guidance to local adjudicators through periodic meetings to minimize site-level variability in adjudication.</p>
