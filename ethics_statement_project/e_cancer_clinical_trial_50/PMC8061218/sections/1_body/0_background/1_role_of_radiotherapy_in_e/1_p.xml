<p id="Par33">Each year, over 150,000 new cases of laryngeal cancer are diagnosed worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and over a thousand new cases are diagnosed in Canada [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Treatment options for early stage laryngeal cancer (T1–2N0) include transoral endoscopic microsurgery [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], radical radiotherapy (RT) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and, in rare cases, partial laryngectomy via open surgery [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Whereas endoscopic microsurgery (with or without laser) typically involves resection of only the tumor-bearing vocal cord with a narrow 1–2 mm margin, current standard RT involves irradiation of the entire larynx [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although prospective evidence comparing RT to surgery is lacking, both treatment options were reported to have equivalent oncological outcomes in terms of local control (LC) and overall survival (OS) in several meta-analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and systematic reviews [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Radical RT outcomes for early glottic cancer are excellent with reported 5-year LC rates varying between 85 and 95% and 5-year OS exceeding 90% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Although it is often suggested that RT is associated with better voice preservation compared to surgery, notably in larger tumors and tumors involving the anterior commissure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], this remains controversial [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In a first meta-analysis including 8 retrospective cohort studies, although 2 studies reported improved voice preservation with RT, pooled results showed similar voice outcomes between transoral laser surgery and RT in T1 glottic cancers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In a more recent meta-analysis including 14 studies and comparing outcomes of surgery vs. RT for T1 glottis cancers, while subjective voice assessments were comparable, RT was associated with improved maximum phonation time and decreased fundamental frequency [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Selection of optimal treatment modality currently involves institutional expertise and elicitation of patient preferences, and although substantiated by debatable evidence, also takes into account factors such as tumor size, location and histology [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In a recent prospective study on the choice of treatment in patients with T1–2N0 glottic cancer, it was reported while 51% of patients are oriented directly towards RT by the medical team (i.e. deemed not suitable for surgery), a third of patients offered either transoral laser surgery or RT opted for RT [
