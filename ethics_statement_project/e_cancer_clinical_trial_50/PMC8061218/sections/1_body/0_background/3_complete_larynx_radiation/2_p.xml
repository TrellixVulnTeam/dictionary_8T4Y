<p id="Par37">Although swallowing motion is associated with large larynx excursion up to 2 cm in the superior direction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], swallowing motion was reported to be rare, rapid and easily suppressed by patients, and is therefore considered to have negligible impact on RT dose delivery [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Although precaution should be taken to ensure that the planning CT is not acquired while the patient is swallowing (to avoid a risk of systematic error throughout treatment), additional margins to account for swallowing motion appear unnecessary [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. On the other hand, respiratory motion in the order of several millimetres has also been described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Respiratory motion reaching 6 mm in the superior-inferior direction and 2 mm in the antero-posterior direction has previously been described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Such intra-fraction motion cannot be addressed by means of daily image guidance and can be associated with a risk of tumor miss in the context of tighter treatment margin. In addition, occurrence of a larynx shift in relation to the vertebral structures, potentially resulting from anatomical changes over time or set-up reproducibility, has also been described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The latter finding stresses the importance of daily imaging with laryngeal match rather than bone match if tight margins are considered.
