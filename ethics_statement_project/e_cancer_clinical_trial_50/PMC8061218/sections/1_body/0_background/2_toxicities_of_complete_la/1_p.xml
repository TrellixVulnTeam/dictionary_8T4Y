<p id="Par34">Despite good LC, a substantial number of patients treated with radical RT experience persistent voice impairment after treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Several studies have reported mild-to-moderate voice impairments after early glottic cancer RT in the acute, subacute and chronic settings [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. There is currently limited data on threshold doses for functional voice preservation and, in the context of current RT fields, this has been of little pertinence considering that the entire larynx would receive the full dose, leaving little room for organs at risk sparing. Dornfeld et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] found a strong correlation between quality of speech and doses to various structures of the glottic and supraglottic larynx as well as the pharyngeal walls. Available dose-volume data suggest that mean dose to the larynx above 45 Gy and mean dose to the non-involved vocal cord above 50 Gy are predictors of grade ≥ 2 laryngeal oedema and worse voice outcomes [
