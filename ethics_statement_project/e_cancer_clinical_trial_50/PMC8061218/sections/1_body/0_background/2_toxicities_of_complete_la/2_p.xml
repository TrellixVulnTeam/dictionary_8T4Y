<p id="Par35">Other common toxicities of larynx RT for early glottic cancer include increased risk of carotid artery stenosis and hypothyroidism. Cerebrovascular morbidity from carotid artery stenosis has been documented in several studies in the setting of conventional RT [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In a recent SEER-database study, RT for treatment of early glottic cancer was associated with an increased risk of mortality due to cerebrovascular events in comparison to surgery [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], with highest frequency at 1 year after treatment. Other severe toxicities of larynx RT include less than 1% risk of permanent tracheostomy due persistent laryngeal oedema and loss of functional larynx [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and less than 1% risk of persistent mild or moderate dysphagia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Importantly, laryngeal cancer patients have 22% risk of developing a secondary malignancy, with the wide majority originating from the upper aero-digestive tract [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In this context, their previous history of complete larynx RT limits their future therapeutic options.
