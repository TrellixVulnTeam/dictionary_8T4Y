<p id="Par116">The delivery of VC-RT will be guided by cautious principles to maximize the safety of treatment delivery which will include: careful definition of tumor extension in collaboration with a head and neck surgeon, use of planning MRI where possible for optimal tumor staging and delineation, use of an ITV for breathing motion, as well as mandatory daily volumetric IGRT. The primary endpoint of the trial will be LC, with secondary endpoints of quality of life (including voice, dysphagia and head and neck symptom burden), toxicity as well as objective measures of voice. If positive, this would result in a paradigm shift in the approach to radiation for treatment early glottic cancers in the institutions where CL-RT remains the standard. On the contrary, if VC-RT demonstrates inferior LC compared to CL-RT, the results of this trial would strengthen the necessity to maintain conservative margins until the possible loopholes in the safety of VC-RT are better understood.</p>
