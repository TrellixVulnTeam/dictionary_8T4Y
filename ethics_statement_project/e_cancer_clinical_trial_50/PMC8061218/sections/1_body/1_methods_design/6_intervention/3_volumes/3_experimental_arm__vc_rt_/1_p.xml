<p id="Par74">The RT volume would include the entire ipsilateral vocal cord in stage T1a disease, or both vocal cords in T1b disease. An internal target volume (ITV) consisting in an isotropic 6 mm margin will be added to account for respiratory motion. An additional margin of 2–3 mm margin will be added for setup uncertainty (Fig.

    <sub>VC-RT</sub> = GTV plus a manual expansion to include the entire ipsilateral vocal cord in stage T1a disease, or both vocal cords in stage T1b disease. In cases where the GTV is not visualized, only a CTV (comprising the entire involved vocal cord in T1a or both vocal cords in T1b) will be contoured.
