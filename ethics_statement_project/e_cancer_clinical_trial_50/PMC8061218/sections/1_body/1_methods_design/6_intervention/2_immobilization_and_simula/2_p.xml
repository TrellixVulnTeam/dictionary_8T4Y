<p id="Par69">Clinicians should be aware of the risk of swallowing during CT simulation. Patients should be instructed not to swallow during the planning CT and MRI, as well as during their radiation treatment. Co-registration of the planning CT with a complementary planning volumetric imaging (such as MRI or contrast-enhanced CT) should be performed in order to verify the position of the larynx. If only one simulation imaging is obtained at time of planning, the position of the larynx should be verified on the first fraction of radiotherapy using a volumetric imaging method allowing 3D image reconstruction (Ex: Cone beam CT, CT on rail, MR-Linac).</p>
