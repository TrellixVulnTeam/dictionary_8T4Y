<p id="Par95">A volumetric imaging method allowing 3D image reconstruction (Ex: Cone beam CT, CT on rail, MR-Linac) will be required daily for set-up verification. Additional images (e.g. confirmatory kV X-ray) may be used as supplemental verification. Larynx soft-tissue matching is required (as opposed to bony landmark [e.g. spine, base of skull] alignment).</p>
