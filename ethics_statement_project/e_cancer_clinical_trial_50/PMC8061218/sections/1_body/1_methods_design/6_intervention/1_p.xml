<p id="Par67">In both treatment arms, patients will be treated with a radical course of radiotherapy using a standard mild hypofractionation regimen of 5 fractions per week, over 4 to 6â€‰weeks. For pragmatic reasons, each participating institution is allowed to use their standard of care dose and fractionation, but will have to be identical between the standard and experimental arms at each institution. Each center will provide, at time study entrance, what dose and fractionation will be used. This dose and fractionation will be the same for both arms and cannot change over the course of the study. The study is stratified by participating institution, which means that it will be stratified by dose/fractionation. In both treatment arms, a daily volumetric imaging method will be required for set-up verification, with match on the larynx.</p>
