<p id="Par103">According to previous experience, expected LC after CL-RT is estimated to be 92% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Assuming a non-inferiority margin of 8%, if LC in the VC-RT arm is â‰¥84% at 2-years, we will deem the VC-RT arm acceptable. With a sample size of 111 patients, over 82% power will detect a margin difference of 8%, at a target significance level of 0.05 using a one-sided, exact binomial test (NCSS-PASS 2005). The purpose of the randomization will be to generate currently unavailable data on secondary outcomes of voice impairment, dysphagia and quality of life in the CL-RT arm. Considering a 5% attrition rate, 155 patients will be randomized in a 1:3 ratio to CL-RT (39 patients) and VC-RT (116 patients) arms. Patients will be stratified by stage (T1a/T1b) and by institution.
