<p id="Par48">We propose a phase II, multicentre Bayesian trial. A total of 155 patients will be randomized in a 1:3 ratio to CL-RT (39 patients) or VC-RT (116 patients). Patients will be stratified by tumor stage (T1a/T1b) and by site (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This study, which is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03759431), will include tertiary, academic hospitals in Canada and the United States. One dose and fractionation regimen will be determined by each participating center and will have to be the same in both arms. The study is powered to compare LC of VC-RT compared to historical outcomes of CL-RT. The purpose of the randomization will be to generate data on secondary outcomes of voice impairment, dysphagia and quality of life as well as survival outcomes in the control arm.
