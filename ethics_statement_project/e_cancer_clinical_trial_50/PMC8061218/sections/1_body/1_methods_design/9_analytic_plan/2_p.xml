<p id="Par106">There will be two planned analysis: 1) an interim analysis and, 2) a final analysis. The interim analysis will be done after 55 patients on the experimental arm have a minimum follow-up of 6 months. A short follow-up time of 6 months was chosen for the interim analysis for safety (i.e. for early detection of local recurrence trends). The trial may be interrupted early if VC-RT is deemed not promising on interim analysis. The final analysis will performed 2 years after accrual is completed.</p>
