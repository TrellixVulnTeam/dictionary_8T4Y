Oral nutritional supplement is the first choice of nutritional support recommended by current guidelines, which can supplement the lack of energy and protein in patients with esophageal cancer, improve nutritional status and improve the quality of life, but there are few clinical studies. Therefore, the purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effect of oral nutritional supplement therapy on nutritional status and quality of life in patients with esophageal cancer treated undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy.<h4>Methods</h4>This is a prospective randomized controlled trial to study the effects of oral nutritional supplement therapy on nutritional status and quality of life in patients with esophageal cancer undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This study is approved by the Clinical Research Society of our hospital. Patients will be randomly divided into ONS group and traditional diet group. The nutritional status, quality of life score and adverse reactions will be observed before and after radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The data will be analyzed by SPSS 16.0.<h4>Discussion</h4>This study will evaluate the effect of oral nutritional supplement therapy on nutritional status and quality of life of patients with esophageal cancer undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The results of this experiment will establish clinical evidence for the application of oral nutritional supplement therapy in patients with esophageal cancer undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy.<h4>Osf registration number</h4>DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/9ZW34.", "affiliation": "Department of Oncology, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Clinical Trial Protocol", "research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": {"grantId": "No.YKK17104", "agency": "the Project of Nanjing Health Commission", "orderIn": "0"}}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Esophageal Neoplasms", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "CO", "qualifierName": "complications", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "PP", "qualifierName": "physiopathology", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "TH", "qualifierName": "therapy", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Malnutrition", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "ET", "qualifierName": "etiology", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "PC", "qualifierName": "prevention & control", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Nutritional Support", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "MT", "qualifierName": "methods", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Nutritional Status"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Quality of Life"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Adult"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Female"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Male"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Chemoradiotherapy", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "AE", "qualifierName": "adverse effects", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}}}]}, "subsetList": {"subset": [{"code": "AIM", "name": "Core clinical journals"}, {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000025342"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8078272"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8078272?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2021-04-26", "dateOfCreation": "2021-04-21", "firstIndexDate": "2021-04-22", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2021-04-29", "dateOfRevision": "2021-05-08", "firstPublicationDate": "2021-04-01"}, "htmllinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8078272", "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The incidence of malnutrition in patients with esophageal cancer is high, which seriously affects the therapeutic effect and quality of life.
