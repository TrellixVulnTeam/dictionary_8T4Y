<p>This study will be randomized into groups without any stratification. Through simple randomization, the patients in the study will be divided into the observation group and the control group according to the 1:1 ratio. Due to the limitation of the intervention in this study, this study cannot achieve strict double-blindness. We will ensure that the study designer, allocators, data analysts, intervention supervisors, and some researchers are blind to personnel allocation.</p>
