<p>The study flow chart is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>. Patients will be initially screened and recruited by the urologists in outpatient. Those who meet the entry criteria and sign the consent form will go for mpMRI within 2 weeks, and only those whose MRI indicates at least one lesion with a Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) V.2.1 â‰¥3 will proceed to the randomisation. With allocation, men will be assigned to cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy using the three-dimensional matrix positioning method or to software-based fusion-targeted biopsy using the MIM symphony software in a 1:1 ratio while others will drop out of the trial. Men in both arms will be hospitalised 1 hour before the prostate biopsy. The biopsy procedure, which usually lasts for less than 30 min, will be performed under a local anaesthetic block in an operation room. In addition to different targeted biopsy methods, a 20-region template-guided prostate biopsy (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>) will be performed after the targeted biopsy in each man, which can be a reference to the different targeted techniques. The samples from the biopsy will be sent to the pathological department for assessment after the procedure. All participants will be discharged the following day after the biopsy. The pathological assessment will be reported within 2 weeks of post-biopsy. The details and timeframe of the trial are shown in
