<p>The data will be collected from the patient/relative of a patient at registration, and the medical record on 2 weeks and 6 weeks. The demographic information (age, height, weight, body mass index), PSA and family history will be recorded on registration, as well as the DRE will be performed. On 2 weeks after the registration, an MRI result will be recorded, including a PI-RADS score, prostate volume and suspicious lesion volume. Both prostate volume and suspicious lesion volume will be measured by mpMRI on the T2WI sequence. The data of pathological assessment will be recorded on 6 weeks (2 weeks post-biopsy) including an overall Gleason score and a separate Gleason score for each biopsy core. Besides, the length and per cent of tumour in each biopsy core will also be reported.</p>
