<p>For the non-inferiority hypothesis, using a 10% non-inferiority margin, using 80% power and 5% one-sided Î±, assuming a detection rate of clinically significant cancer for cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy of 50% and a detection rate for software-based fusion-targeted biopsy of 45%, using allocation ratio of 1:1, 137 men per arm will be required. Assuming that 50% has at least one suspicious lesion on mpMRI, 548 men are needed. Account for 10% withdraw/loss, a total of 602 participants are required for inclusion.</p>
