<p>All biopsies in both arms will be performed via the perineum by two urologists (HW with an experience of more than 10 years and BH with an experience of more than 5 years) with an UltraView 800 ultrasound device (BK Ultrasound, USA) and a bi-planar TRUS probe (8848, BK Ultrasound) under a local anaesthetic block. Before performing the biopsy, one urologist will read the report and the image of MRI to identify the location of target lesions, while another one will be blinded to the MRI result.</p>
