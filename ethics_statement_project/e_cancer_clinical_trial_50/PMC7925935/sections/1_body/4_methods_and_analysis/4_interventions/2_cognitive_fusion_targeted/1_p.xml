<p>Each participant in this arm will undergo a cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy first. A novel three-dimensional matrix positioning-based cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy will be performed under the guidance of a bi-plane TRUS probe after reviewing the mpMRI finding. Three cores of biopsy will be taken for each suspicious lesion which is showed in mpMRI with PI-RADS score of 3â€“5. The details of the cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy were described in our previous research.

 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The urologist who performs the targeted biopsy will be determined by a random number generated by PROC PLAN statement of SAS program.
