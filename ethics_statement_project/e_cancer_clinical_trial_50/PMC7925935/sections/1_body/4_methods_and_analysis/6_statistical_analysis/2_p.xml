<p>The primary analysis in this trial will follow the intention-to-treat principle, including all patients who have undergone randomisation. The primary outcome is the detection rate of csPCa for cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy and software-based fusion-targeted biopsy. The absolute difference between these two arms will be calculated with a 95% CI by estimating with a generalised linear model. The cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy will be described as non-inferior if the lower bound of the 95% CI of the difference in the clinically significant cancer detection rate of the cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy arm compared with the software-based fusion-targeted biopsy arm (cognitive fusion arm minus software-based arm) is higher than âˆ’10%.</p>
