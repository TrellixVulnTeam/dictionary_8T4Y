<p>A research nurse will record all harms or adverse events relevant or not relevant to the procedure of biopsy. Adverse events will be assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. The serious adverse events that include (1) death; (2) life-threatening; (3) hospitalisation and (4) disability or permanent damage will be recorded immediately and then sent to the ethics committee and the monitoring board within 24 hours. All harms and adverse events will be recorded from the registration to 1 week after the biopsy.</p>
