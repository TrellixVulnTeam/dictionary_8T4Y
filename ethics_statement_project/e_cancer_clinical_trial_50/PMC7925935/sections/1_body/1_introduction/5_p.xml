<p>This trial aims to compare three-dimensional matrix positioning cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy and software-based fusion-targeted biopsy for the detection rate of csPCa for men without a prior biopsy for localised PCa. The primary objective is to assess whether the cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy is non-inferior to software-based fusion-targeted biopsy in the detection rate of clinically significant cancer.</p>
