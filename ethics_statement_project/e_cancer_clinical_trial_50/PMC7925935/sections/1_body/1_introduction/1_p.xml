<p>Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer worldwide which leads the five causes of death among men.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Men with an elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level or an abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) are usually considered at risk for PCa and typically have a prostate biopsy subsequently to get samples for pathological diagnosis. The common pathway is a systematic 12-core biopsy under the guidance of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), an approach to randomly get the samples from the whole prostate gland; however, its blind attribution makes it tend to underdiagnose the clinically significant tumour and overdiagnose the clinically insignificant disease.
