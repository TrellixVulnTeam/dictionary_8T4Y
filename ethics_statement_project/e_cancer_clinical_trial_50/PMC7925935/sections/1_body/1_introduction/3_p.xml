<p>Targeted biopsy can be subdivided into three different methods: in-bore MRI, cognitive fusion and software-based fusion. An in-bore MRI-targeted biopsy is described as to perform a targeted biopsy under real-time MRI guidance. Although this method is accurate in locating the targeted lesions, it is a failure to be widely used in clinical practice for its inconvenience and time-consuming use.
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Compared with in-bore MRI-targeted biopsy, another two methods are more acceptable. Cognitive fusion, a procedure of mental state that locates the target of suspicious lesions in the ultrasound image after a review of MRI, is cost-saving because it needs no extra equipment, aside from the essential requirement for a TRUS biopsy. Software-based fusion is an overlap of the real-time ultrasound image and the previous MRI images by software assistance. Although it is widely adopted by urologists or physicians, the barriers of being time-consuming, and having excessive price and training for the additional equipment cannot be omitted.
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7–9</xref> There is always an interesting topic about whether the ability of cognitive fusion with human brains can achieve the same result as a fusion with intricate fusion software.
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, evidence from the comparative trials is little.
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 11–13</xref> To date, the preferred targeted biopsy technique in detecting csPCa between cognitive fusion and software-based fusion is still beyond consensus.
