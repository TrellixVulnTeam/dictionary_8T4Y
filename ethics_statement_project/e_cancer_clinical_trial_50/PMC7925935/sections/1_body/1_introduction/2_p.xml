<p>Thanks to the development of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) in identifying PCa, another pathway named targeted biopsy is getting prevalent. It aims to first perform an mpMRI for localising the tumour precisely and then obtain the samples from the suspicious lesions, and is shown to be more purposeful and less random compared with the systematic biopsy. Several pieces of evidence have proven the superiority of targeted biopsy in detection rates of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) and avoidance of unnecessary biopsy.
