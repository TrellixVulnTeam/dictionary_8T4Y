<p>We have developed a method named three-dimensional matrix positioning to increase the accuracy of cognitive fusion for targeted biopsy detection of csPCa, which involves several fiducial axes derived from MRI localisation of the region of interest, then transposed onto the ultrasound image to help direct the biopsy needle into the right place.
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> This method had shown a reasonable detection rate for csPCa in a pilot cohort. Hence, we conduct this single-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) in order to confirm the finding further.
