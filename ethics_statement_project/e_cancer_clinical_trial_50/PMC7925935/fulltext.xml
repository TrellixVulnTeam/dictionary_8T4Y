Another pathway named targeted biopsy is using multiparametric MRI to localise the tumour precisely and then obtain the samples from the suspicious lesions. Targeted biopsy, which is mainly divided into cognitive fusion method and software-based fusion method, is getting prevalent for its good performance in detecting significant cancer. However, the preferred targeted biopsy technique in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer between cognitive fusion and software-based fusion is still beyond consensus.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This trial is a prospective, single-centre, randomised controlled and non-inferiority study in which all men suspicious to have clinically significant prostate cancer are included. This study aims to determine whether a novel three-dimensional matrix positioning cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy is non-inferior to software-based fusion-targeted biopsy in the detection rate of clinically significant cancer in men without a prior biopsy. The main inclusion criteria are men with elevated serum prostate-specific antigen above 4&#x02013;20 ng/mL or with an abnormal digital rectal examination and have never had a biopsy before. A sample size of 602 participants allowing for a 10% loss will be recruited. All patients will undergo a multiparametric MRI examination, and those who fail to be found with a suspicious lesion, with the anticipation of half of the total number, will be dropped. The remaining participants will be randomly allocated to cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy (n=137) and software-based fusion-targeted biopsy (n=137). The primary outcome is the detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer for cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy and software-based fusion-targeted biopsy in men without a prior biopsy. The clinically significant prostate cancer will be defined as the International Society of Urological Pathology grade group 2 or higher.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the ethics committee of Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.

The common pathway is a systematic 12-core biopsy under the guidance of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), an approach to randomly get the samples from the whole prostate gland; however, its blind attribution makes it tend to underdiagnose the clinically significant tumour and overdiagnose the clinically insignificant disease.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref></p><p>Thanks to the development of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) in identifying PCa, another pathway named targeted biopsy is getting prevalent. It aims to first perform an mpMRI for localising the tumour precisely and then obtain the samples from the suspicious lesions, and is shown to be more purposeful and less random compared with the systematic biopsy. Several pieces of evidence have proven the superiority of targeted biopsy in detection rates of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) and avoidance of unnecessary biopsy.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref></p><p>Targeted biopsy can be subdivided into three different methods: in-bore MRI, cognitive fusion and software-based fusion. An in-bore MRI-targeted biopsy is described as to perform a targeted biopsy under real-time MRI guidance. Although this method is accurate in locating the targeted lesions, it is a failure to be widely used in clinical practice for its inconvenience and time-consuming use.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Compared with in-bore MRI-targeted biopsy, another two methods are more acceptable. Cognitive fusion, a procedure of mental state that locates the target of suspicious lesions in the ultrasound image after a review of MRI, is cost-saving because it needs no extra equipment, aside from the essential requirement for a TRUS biopsy. Software-based fusion is an overlap of the real-time ultrasound image and the previous MRI images by software assistance. Although it is widely adopted by urologists or physicians, the barriers of being time-consuming, and having excessive price and training for the additional equipment cannot be omitted.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref> There is always an interesting topic about whether the ability of cognitive fusion with human brains can achieve the same result as a fusion with intricate fusion software.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, evidence from the comparative trials is little.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 11&#x02013;13</xref> To date, the preferred targeted biopsy technique in detecting csPCa between cognitive fusion and software-based fusion is still beyond consensus.</p><p>We have developed a method named three-dimensional matrix positioning to increase the accuracy of cognitive fusion for targeted biopsy detection of csPCa, which involves several fiducial axes derived from MRI localisation of the region of interest, then transposed onto the ultrasound image to help direct the biopsy needle into the right place.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> This method had shown a reasonable detection rate for csPCa in a pilot cohort. Hence, we conduct this single-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) in order to confirm the finding further.</p><p>This trial aims to compare three-dimensional matrix positioning cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy and software-based fusion-targeted biopsy for the detection rate of csPCa for men without a prior biopsy for localised PCa. The primary objective is to assess whether the cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy is non-inferior to software-based fusion-targeted biopsy in the detection rate of clinically significant cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Trial design</title><p>This prospective, single-centre, randomised controlled and non-inferiority study will take place at Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. The primary objective of this study is to identify whether the three-dimensional matrix positioning cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy is non-inferior to software-based fusion-targeted biopsy in the detection rate of clinically significant cancer in men without a prior biopsy.</p><p>The study flow chart is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>. Patients will be initially screened and recruited by the urologists in outpatient. Those who meet the entry criteria and sign the consent form will go for mpMRI within 2 weeks, and only those whose MRI indicates at least one lesion with a Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) V.2.1 &#x02265;3 will proceed to the randomisation. With allocation, men will be assigned to cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy using the three-dimensional matrix positioning method or to software-based fusion-targeted biopsy using the MIM symphony software in a 1:1 ratio while others will drop out of the trial. Men in both arms will be hospitalised 1 hour before the prostate biopsy. The biopsy procedure, which usually lasts for less than 30 min, will be performed under a local anaesthetic block in an operation room. In addition to different targeted biopsy methods, a 20-region template-guided prostate biopsy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>) will be performed after the targeted biopsy in each man, which can be a reference to the different targeted techniques. The samples from the biopsy will be sent to the pathological department for assessment after the procedure. All participants will be discharged the following day after the biopsy. The pathological assessment will be reported within 2 weeks of post-biopsy.

The details of the cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy were described in our previous research.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> After the targeted biopsy, a 20-region template-guided biopsy will be subsequently performed by another urologist who will be blinded to the MRI results.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The urologist who performs the targeted biopsy will be determined by a random number generated by PROC PLAN statement of SAS program.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Software-based fusion-targeted biopsy arm</title><p>The software-based fusion-targeted biopsy will be performed with the MIM symphony software by taking two-dimensional mpMRI images to create a three-dimensional map then be fused with the ultrasound images. Each suspicious area with a PI-RADS score equal to or more than 3 will be performed a three-core biopsy by one urologist, which will be followed with a 20-region template-guided biopsy by another. Also, whoever performs the targeted biopsy will be randomised.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Histology</title><p>A pathology group, which is blinded to all clinical data including the technique of biopsy, will evaluate the samples. The pathological finding will be reported within 2 weeks post-biopsy. Clinically significant cancer is defined as the ISUP grade group 2 or higher.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Continuous variables will be reported by using means with SDs or median with IQR, while categorical variables will be shown by using frequencies with proportions.</p><p>The primary analysis in this trial will follow the intention-to-treat principle, including all patients who have undergone randomisation. The primary outcome is the detection rate of csPCa for cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy and software-based fusion-targeted biopsy. The absolute difference between these two arms will be calculated with a 95% CI by estimating with a generalised linear model. The cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy will be described as non-inferior if the lower bound of the 95% CI of the difference in the clinically significant cancer detection rate of the cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy arm compared with the software-based fusion-targeted biopsy arm (cognitive fusion arm minus software-based arm) is higher than &#x02212;10%.</p><p>The second outcomes will be analysed with 95% CI and Pearson &#x003a7;<sup>2</sup> test. All reported p values were two sided in this trial.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Sample size</title><p>A retrospective data review for cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy performed at our institution during 2017 showed a clinically significant cancer detection rate of 52.8%,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> while a literature from Germany revealed a clinically significant cancer detection rate of 45%<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> for software-based fusion-targeted biopsy. The patients with PI-RADS score &#x02265;3 account for 60.6% in all patients who had undergone an mpMRI examination at our institution.</p><p>For the non-inferiority hypothesis, using a 10% non-inferiority margin, using 80% power and 5% one-sided &#x003b1;, assuming a detection rate of clinically significant cancer for cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy of 50% and a detection rate for software-based fusion-targeted biopsy of 45%, using allocation ratio of 1:1, 137 men per arm will be required. Assuming that 50% has at least one suspicious lesion on mpMRI, 548 men are needed. Account for 10% withdraw/loss, a total of 602 participants are required for inclusion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Harms and adverse events</title><p>A research nurse will record all harms or adverse events relevant or not relevant to the procedure of biopsy. Adverse events will be assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. The serious adverse events that include (1) death; (2) life-threatening; (3) hospitalisation and (4) disability or permanent damage will be recorded immediately and then sent to the ethics committee and the monitoring board within 24 hours. All harms and adverse events will be recorded from the registration to 1 week after the biopsy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data collection</title><p>The data will be collected from the patient/relative of a patient at registration, and the medical record on 2 weeks and 6 weeks. The demographic information (age, height, weight, body mass index), PSA and family history will be recorded on registration, as well as the DRE will be performed. On 2 weeks after the registration, an MRI result will be recorded, including a PI-RADS score, prostate volume and suspicious lesion volume. Both prostate volume and suspicious lesion volume will be measured by mpMRI on the T2WI sequence. The data of pathological assessment will be recorded on 6 weeks (2 weeks post-biopsy) including an overall Gleason score and a separate Gleason score for each biopsy core. Besides, the length and per cent of tumour in each biopsy core will also be reported.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Monitoring</title><p>A team of independent clinical research associates (CRAs) with all more than 5 years of experience is responsible for being familiar with the trial protocol and monitoring all researchers and all participants involved in the whole processes of this trial. The CRA&#x02019;s role is to (1) monitor the trial plan, the record forms and the case report form before the start of the trial; (2) monitor participants' informed consent and enrolment rates; (3) monitor the compliance of participants and investigators with the protocol, and monitor data quality and authenticity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the ethics committee of Shanghai East Hospital. The results of this study will be disseminated for international peer-reviewed journals and disseminated for presentation at international or national academic conference.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Trial status</title><p>This RCT was first registered online at ClinicalTrials.gov on 13 February 2020. The study is expected to start on 1 September 2020.
