<p id="Par41">The Safe Stop trial is a nationwide, multicentre, prospective, single-arm, interventional trial in the Netherlands. According to the KEYNOTE-006 trial, the (maximum) treatment duration of PD-1 blockade has been set at two years in the Netherlands [

The current protocol has been developed at the 19th European Cancer Organisation - American Association for Cancer Research - European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer – European Society for Medical Oncology (ECCO-AACR-EORTC-ESMO) Workshop on Methods in Clinical Cancer Research with the support of a biostatistician, melanoma surgeon, medical oncologist, and patient advocate from ESMO. As patients usually have access to long treatment duration (2 years or longer) with PD-1 blockade, randomisation to early discontinuation was considered not feasible in this setting as the sample size for a randomised non-inferiority study would have been much higher and patients may refuse the randomisation.
