<p id="Par58">After confirmed CR/PR and subsequent early discontinuation of PD-1 blockade, clinical evaluation (visits, laboratory measurements, and diagnostic CT) will be performed every 12 (±1) weeks, according to the standard of care in the Netherlands (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). At inclusion and thereafter, patients will be asked to complete HRQoL and resource use questionnaires. Patient-reported outcomes of non-preference-based disease-specific and preference-based generic HRQoL, fear, productivity, informal care, and healthcare resource use outside the hospital will be assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Melanoma (FACT-M) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], EuroQoL Health Utilities Index (EQ-5D, version 5 L) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], cancer worry scale (CWS) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and Resources Utilization Questionnaire Melanoma (RUQ-M) by the Institute for Medical Technology Assessment (iMTA) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. After the first year, the interval between the visits will increase. In case patients experience PD according to RECIST v1.1, PD-1 blockade will be restarted. Another salvage therapy is allowed at the discretion of the treating physician. For all included patients, data will be collected until the end of the follow-up period of the study, death, withdrawal, or other reasons for early discontinuation (whichever comes first).
