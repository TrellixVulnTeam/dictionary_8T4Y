<p id="Par43">For response evaluation after the initiation of PD-1 blockade, diagnostic computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are required every 12 ± 1 weeks. Patients can participate after confirmed response (CR or PR) according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST) v1.1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. When patients achieve their first CR or PR upon first-line PD-1 blockade, written patient information can be provided (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for timeline and study assessments). At 6–12 (+ 1) weeks after the first documentation of CR and at 12 (±1) weeks after the first documentation of PR, tumour response needs to be confirmed according to RECIST v1.1. Patients with a confirmed response and willing to discontinue first-line PD-1 blockade are eligible for inclusion and subsequently discontinue treatment up to 6 (+ 1) weeks after first confirmation of response (CR or PR). In case patients experience PD after trial enrolment, PD-1 blockade will be restarted. Another salvage therapy is allowed at the discretion of the treating physician.
