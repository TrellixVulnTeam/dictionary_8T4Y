<p id="Par40">The primary objective is to evaluate the rate of ongoing response in patients with advanced and metastatic melanoma who early discontinue first-line monotherapy with nivolumab or pembrolizumab upon achieving CR or PR (i.e. before two years of treatment). Secondary objectives include disease outcome, AEs, and HRQoL. In addition, the impact of early PD-1 blockade discontinuation on productivity (paid and unpaid work), healthcare resources, and hours of informal care will be measured.</p>
