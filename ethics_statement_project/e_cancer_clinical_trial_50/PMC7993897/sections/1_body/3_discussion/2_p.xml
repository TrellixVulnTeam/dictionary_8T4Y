<p id="Par67">In this proof-of-concept study of early discontinuation of PD-1 blockade, maintaining patient safety is paramount and pursued by the study design in patients with a relatively favourable prognosis. The decision to discontinue treatment early is based on the treatment regimen and response-driven; only patients achieving CR or PR upon first-line monotherapy with PD-1 blockade are eligible. Patients with SD are not eligible, as patients who achieve SD as best overall response and complete two years of PD-1 blockade have a significantly worse PFS compared to patients with CR or PR (PFS of 40% vs. 82–85% at 24 months after completion of 2 year pembrolizumab treatment [

Currently, monotherapy with PD-1 blockade is the most frequently administered ICI for the treatment of advanced and metastatic melanoma in patients with a more favourable risk profile. In patients with rapidly progressive and/or (severe) symptomatic BRAF-mutant melanoma, BRAF-directed therapy is often prescribed as first-line treatment [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In patients with rapidly progressive melanoma, cerebral metastases and/or elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), combination therapy with nivolumab-ipilimumab is usually preferred, in particular in patients with BRAF-wild type melanoma. For the Safe Stop trial, patients treated with the combination nivolumab-ipilimumab or BRAF/MEK inhibitors will not be eligible, as inclusion of these patients would affect the homogenous population with regard to patient characteristics and administered therapy.
