<p id="Par37">In the phase III registration trials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], PD-1 blockers were usually administered for up to two years or even longer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Interestingly, durable tumour responses have been observed after early discontinuation (&lt; 2 years) of PD-1 blockade [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], not only in patients who achieved a complete response (CR) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] but also in patients with a partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In patients who discontinued PD-1 blockade early because of adverse events (AEs), outcomes were not compromised and tumour responses were ongoing at &gt; 5 years after treatment commencement [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Therefore, early discontinuation of PD-1 blockade is considered feasible [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], in particular since rechallenge with PD-1 blockade induces overall response rates of up to 90% in patients with progressive disease (PD) after prior discontinuation of PD-1 blockade [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. As pre-specified criteria for (early) discontinuation of PD-1 blockade were lacking in retrospective analyses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], it is not yet known which patients can safely discontinue PD-1 blockade at an earlier time point. Based on the median time to objective response of approximately 3 months in patients with advanced melanoma [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], the preferred treatment duration of PD-1 blockade is considered to be at least 3–6 months [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].
