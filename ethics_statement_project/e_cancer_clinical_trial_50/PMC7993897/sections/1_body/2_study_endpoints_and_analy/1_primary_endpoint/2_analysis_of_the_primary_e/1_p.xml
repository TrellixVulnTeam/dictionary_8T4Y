<p id="Par60">The rate of ongoing response at 24 months (or equivalently progression-free survival [PFS] from start of treatment) will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and its one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) (as the lower boundary of a two-sided 90% CI). These results will be compared with the response rate of a well-defined historical cohort of first-line treatment with pembrolizumab in advanced melanoma (KEYNOTE-006) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Among all patients who had a CR or PR in the KEYNOTE-006, 39% of patients completed 24 months of treatment and had an ongoing response at treatment discontinuation. A 29% ongoing response rate at 24 months after treatment start in patients who early discontinue treatment is considered acceptable, as the current protocol will include less selected patients from clinical practice and patients will have the option to restart treatment with nivolumab or pembrolizumab at PD, thereby potentially achieving a second tumour response. The study will be declared positive for the primary endpoint if the one-sided 95% CI is higher than 29%. The two-sided 90% CI will be constructed using the generalised Brookmeyer and Crowley method based on a g-transformed CI [
