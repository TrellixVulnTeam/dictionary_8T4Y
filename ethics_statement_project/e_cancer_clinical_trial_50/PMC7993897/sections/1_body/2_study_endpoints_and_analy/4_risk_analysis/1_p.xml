<p id="Par64">Patients will be treated and evaluated according to the standard of care in the Netherlands. As PD-1 blockade will be discontinued earlier than two years, participation in this trial may affect treatment efficacy which will be evaluated as the primary objective of this study. As a result, participation in this trial may affect clinical outcome and even survival of these patients. Importantly, following the development of disease progression, re-treatment with monotherapy PD-1 blockade (preferred) or other treatment options can be initiated at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist. However, as an increasing number of physicians discontinue treatment on an individual basis at achieving CR or PR, the additional risk of participation in this trial is considered limited compared to daily clinical practice.</p>
