<p id="Par65">A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor quality and patient safety in this multicentre trial. As discontinuation of PD-1 blockade should neither lead to an increased number of fatal or life-threatening events, nor an increased incidence of new or symptomatic brain metastases, these are considered as SAEs which need to be reported expedited (i.e. within 24â€‰h) throughout the course of the trial to the sponsor and will be made available to the DSMB. After the inclusion of 75 patients, the DSMB will review the data and advise on study continuation, based on the number and severity of SAEs. If the available data are not sufficiently mature after the inclusion of 75 patients (e.g. as a result of fast inclusion), 6-monthly DSMB evaluations will be added until the DSMB has confirmed that the provided data are mature, or until 200 patients are included. If the incidence of these particular SAEs is unexpectedly high, this could result in early termination of the study after consultation of the DSMB.</p>
