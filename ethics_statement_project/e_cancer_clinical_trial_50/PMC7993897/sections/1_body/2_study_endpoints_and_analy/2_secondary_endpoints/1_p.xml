<p id="Par61">The secondary endpoints include best overall response, duration of response after discontinuation of PD-1 blockade, the need and outcome of rechallenge with PD-1 blockade, and changes in SAE(s). After discontinuation of PD-1 blockade, changes in HRQoL (FACT-M, EuroQol EQ-5D, CWS) will be measured at different time points and compared with patients without early discontinuation of PD-1 blockade. In addition, measurements will be performed to determine the impact of treatment discontinuation on healthcare resource use, productivity losses (RUQ-M by iMTA), and hours of informal care.</p>
