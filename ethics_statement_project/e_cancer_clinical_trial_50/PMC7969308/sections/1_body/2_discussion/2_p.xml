<p>The present study aims to investigate the effects of a heavy-load resistance-training program on skeletal muscle cellular outcomes in women diagnosed with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. The results are expected to provide insights about the mechanism involved in side effects of chemotherapy on skeletal muscle. Such knowledge can be used to design effective physical exercise programs to support individuals with breast cancer during and following chemotherapy and possibly reduce long-lasting side effects such as impairments in physical function, fatigue, and risk for comorbidities.</p>
