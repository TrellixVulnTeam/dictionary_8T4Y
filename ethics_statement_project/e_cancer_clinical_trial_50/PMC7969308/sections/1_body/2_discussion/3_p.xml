<p>To our knowledge, this will be the first randomized controlled study evaluating heavy-load RT during (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy treatment in breast cancer patients to explore its effects on muscle cellular outcomes in a relatively larger study population in comparison to previous studies.

 </sup> Although the primary outcome of this present study is muscle fiber CSA, we are also including a wide range of biological measurements, including specific proteins involved in skeletal muscle hypertrophy/degradation and regulators of muscle fiber function. These analyses will provide further insight into the underlying mechanism through which chemotherapy affects muscle tissue and how RT could be used as a therapeutic measure to counteract immediate and long-term treatment side effects. As exercise has been suggested to have an antitumor effect

 </sup> regular exercise could have a positive effect on the recurrence rate. In this study, we will investigate changes in myokines with potential antitumor effect in both muscle tissue and blood and these results will give valuable insight to exercise-induced antitumor mechanisms. However, the possible effect on cancer recurrence rate has to be further explored in future longitudinal studies as our study will only include follow-up measures at 6 months post end of treatment. Importantly, the feasibility of the training program has been confirmed by a previous study (Phys-Can study)
