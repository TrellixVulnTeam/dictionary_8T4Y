<p>Exploratory analyses on the effects of the RT on the expression levels of myokines, previously proposed to have an antitumor effect, will be conducted. Relevant targets, including, but not limited to, IL-6, IL-15, SPARC, and TWEAK will be evaluated on the mRNA level by real-time PCR analyses (RNA extracted from biopsies) and protein level by Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (muscle and blood samples). Blood samples will be obtained by venipuncture and participants are asked to avoid smoking and alcohol and not to engage in any strenuous physical activity 24 hours before the blood sample. IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1β, IFN-γ, TNF-α, TNF1R will be measured using ELISA based methods. Frozen sera will be saved for further analyses that can be included later.</p>
