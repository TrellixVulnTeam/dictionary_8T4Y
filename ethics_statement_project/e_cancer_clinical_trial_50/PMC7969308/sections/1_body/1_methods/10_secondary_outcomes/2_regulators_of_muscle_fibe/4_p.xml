<p>Muscle fiber myonuclear and SC content per muscle fiber will be measured using immunohistochemistry in cross-sections of muscle biopsies as previously described. Myonuclei- and SCs content per muscle fiber will be assessed for the different phenotypes separately (type I, type IIa and IIx). Regulators of muscle fiber size, that is proteins involved in muscle protein synthesis and protein degradation will be measured using Western blot analysis in muscle homogenate. See Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for details.
