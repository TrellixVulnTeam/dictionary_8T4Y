 </sup> starting at 4 km/hour with an incline of 2%. The inclination increases with 1% every minute until reaching 12%, from which the speed increases 0.5 km/hour per minute until exhaustion. Oxygen consumption and minute ventilation will be measured continuously using an oxygen analyzer (Vmax Encore system, Carefusion, CA). Heart rate will be measured using a heart rate monitor (Polar RS400, Kempele, Finland) and self-perceived exertion will be recorded using a standardized Borg-scale.
