<p>Proteins involved in protection against cellular stress (Heat Shock proteins: Hsp 27, Î±B-crystalline, Hsp 60, and Hsp 70), as well as enzymes involved in mitochondrial function (CS, Cox 4, and HAD) will be assessed in muscle homogenate using Western blot analysis. In addition, mitochondrial structure will be studied in cross-sections and whole fiber preparations of muscle biopsies using immunohistochemistry.</p>
