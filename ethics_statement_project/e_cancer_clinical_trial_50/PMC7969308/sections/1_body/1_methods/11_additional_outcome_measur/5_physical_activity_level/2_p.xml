<p>Physical activity level will be assessed by SenseWear Armband (SWA) Mini (BodyMedia Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). All participants will be instructed to wear the SWA for 7 consecutive days. Only valid days with at least 80% wearing time will be included in the analyses. SWA data will be downloaded and analyzed with software developed by the manufacturer (SenseWear Professional Research Software Version 8.1, BodyMedia Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). During this week, participants will self-report their physical activity level (time spent, types of activity, and its intensity), time spent sleeping, time spent in sedentary behaviors (sitting, lying down during waking hours), use of medications for nausea or pain, and potential sick leave or reduced work capacity in logbooks.</p>
