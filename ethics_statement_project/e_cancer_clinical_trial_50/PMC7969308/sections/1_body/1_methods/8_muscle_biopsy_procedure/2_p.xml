<p>Muscle biopsies are obtained from the mid-section of 
 <italic>m. vastus lateralis</italic> under local anaesthesia (Xylocain adrenaline, 10 mg ml
 <sup>−1</sup> + 5 μg ml
 <sup>−1</sup>, AstraZeneca, Södertälje, Sweden). Briefly, a 1 to 2 cm incision will be made in the skin and the fascia of 
 <italic>m. vastus lateralis</italic>. Biopsies are collected using a 6 mm Pelomi-needle (Albertslund, Denmark; Bergström technique) with manual suction to obtain muscle samples (≈200 mg). Biopsies will be rinsed in ice-cold saline 0.9% NaCl (Braun, Melsungen, Germany) and carefully dissected free of visual fat, connective tissue and blood. All pieces but 1 will be frozen in isopentane, precooled on dry ice, and stored at −80°C for later analysis. The last piece (≈10 mg) will be transferred to 500 μl RNA
 <italic>later</italic> Stabilization Solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and stored at +4°C for at least 24 hours before being transferred to −20°C for long-time storage.
