 </sup> With a similar effect on muscle fiber size (+898 ± 840 μm
 <sup>2</sup>), we need 10 participants in each group to get a statistical power of 80% in the present study, to further enhance the power up to 95%, we need 16 participants in each group. Consequently, 50 participants (25 in each arm) will be recruited to account for drop-outs during the intervention. The power calculation is based on the PEPC trial
