<p>Muscle fiber size, measured as muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) represents the primary muscle cellular outcome. Muscle fiber CSA will be measured using immunohistochemistry in cross-sections of muscle biopsies. Briefly, transverse serial sections of the muscle biopsy (8 μm thick) will be cut using a cryostat microtome at −22°C and mounted on glass slides. Serial cross-sections will be immunohistochemically stained for fiber types (type I, type IIa, and IIx) for CSA measure. Muscle fiber CSA will be measured for the different phenotypes separately. Assessors will be blinded to each participant's allocation.</p>
