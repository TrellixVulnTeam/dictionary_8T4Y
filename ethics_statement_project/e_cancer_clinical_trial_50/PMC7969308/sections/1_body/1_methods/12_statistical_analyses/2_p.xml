<p>Data will be analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Analyses will include standard descriptive statistics, 
 <italic>t</italic> tests, correlation, regression and two-way repeated-measures ANOVA or the comparable nonparametric test as necessary to examine differences between and within groups, at T0, T1, and T2. In addition, a per-protocol analysis, that is, adherence to the protocol, will be conducted. Should imbalances in important variables be detected, sensitivity analyses will also be added including these as covariates in the model. All data will be cleaned and quality-checked before analysis.
