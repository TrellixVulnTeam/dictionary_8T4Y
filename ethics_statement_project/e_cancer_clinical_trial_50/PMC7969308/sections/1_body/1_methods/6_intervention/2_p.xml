<p>Participants in the intervention group will perform supervised heavy-load RT twice a week from the week following T0 and throughout the course of treatment with chemotherapy, approximately 16â€Šweeks. Sessions will be performed at a public gym and led by trained coaches. The following 6 exercises will be included in the program: seated leg-press, seated chest-press, seated leg-curl, seated row and seated leg-extension performed in machines and seated overhead-press using dumbbells. Completed training (weight lifted, number of repetitions and sets) and rating of perceived exhaustion will be documented by the participants in training logbooks. The scheduled timeframe of the training is described in Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Briefly, the first 2 weeks of the program represent familiarization to the training protocol, tests, and Omni-scale for self-reported perceived exertion.

 </sup> During this period, the participants will perform exercises at a light load. After the first 1 RM-test (1 repetition maximum test), training will progress in sets and training load before testing of 6- and 10 RM which will provide the participants with individualized loads. Rest periods between sets will be 2 (6 RM training load) and 1 minute (10 RM training load) for the 2 different sessions, respectively. The training load will be adjusted throughout the intervention period. Participants in the control group are encouraged to continue with their activity as usual that is, maintain their habitual physical activity level and not initiate RT during chemotherapy. To increase interest in participation, controls will be invited to a 2-week introduction to the same resistance-training program as the intervention group following completion of chemotherapy and offered a 12-month membership at a local gym, free of charge.
