 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> These trials are non-comparable because they used different eligibility criteria with variation in upper limits of age, performance status, included lymphoma subtypes, previous treatment, and response status in the selection of patients for autologous HSCT. Additionally, data on some secondary CNS lymphoma subgroups, such as patients with CNS involvement at presentation and patients with disease refractory to the first-line treatment, are scarce because these patients were considered in only one of the published prospective studies and accounted for less than a fifth of the patients enrolled.
