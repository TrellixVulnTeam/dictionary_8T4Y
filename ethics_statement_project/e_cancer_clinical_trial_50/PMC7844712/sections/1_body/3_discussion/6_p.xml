<p id="para400">In conclusion, the results of the MARIETTA trial are a step forward in the treatment of secondary CNS lymphoma. In particular, progression-free survival for transplanted patients is encouraging and constitutes a good platform to discuss future strategies in this hard-to-treat patient cohort. Patients with CNS involvement at initial diagnosis seem to benefit from treatment with debulking R-CHOP followed by MATRixâ€“RICE and autologous HSCT. Further efforts are urgently required to improve remission before transplantation, especially in patients with CNS involvement at first relapse. Different therapies for patients with CNS involvement at presentation or relapse should be addressed in future trials.</p>
