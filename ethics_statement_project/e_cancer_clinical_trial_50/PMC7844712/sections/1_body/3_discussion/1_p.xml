<p id="para350">To our knowledge, the MARIETTA study is the largest prospective trial focused on patients with secondary CNS lymphoma; it was done in 24 centres in four countries, representing the most geographically extensive trial in patients with secondary CNS lymphoma to date, which supports the generalisability of results. This trial showed that the sequential combination of MATRix and RICE followed by autologous HSCT was active in this population of patients with a very poor prognosis, meeting the predetermined threshold for progression-free survival, without major safety concerns. Response to MATRix was an independent favourable prognostic factor, whereas patients with MATRix-refractory disease had little benefit from crossing to RICE and autologous HSCT. Survival of patients who had a transplantation was encouraging, with significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival in chemotherapy-naive patients treated at presentation compared with patients who had CNS relapse after a first-line chemoimmunotherapy.</p>
