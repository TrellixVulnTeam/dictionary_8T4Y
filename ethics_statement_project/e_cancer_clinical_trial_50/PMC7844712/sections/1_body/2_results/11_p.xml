<p id="para320">No cases of unexpected toxicity were recorded after debulking R-CHOP. 319 (71%) of the 450 planned MATRix–RICE courses were delivered (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 10</xref>); dose reductions were indicated in 32 (10%) courses in 24 (32%) patients. Interruptions due to toxicity occurred only during MATRix: interruption was permanent in four patients and transient in five patients (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 10</xref>). 64 (85%) patients received intrathecal chemotherapy. Grade 3–4 toxicity was almost exclusively haematological (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>): neutropenia in 46 (61%) patients, thrombocytopenia in 45 (60%), and anaemia in 26 (35%). Grade 3 infections occurred in 14 (19%) patients and grade 4 in eight (11%) patients; grade 3 neutropenic fever occurred in ten (13%) patients and grade 4 in one (1%) patient (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 10</xref>). 79 serious adverse events (all grades) were recorded in 42 (56%) patients, mostly febrile neutropenia (n=39 episodes) and infections (n=25). Serious adverse events also included bleeding (n=4), bowel perforation (n=2), acute renal failure (n=2), acute neurotoxicity (n=2), pulmonary thromboembolism (n=1), atrial fibrillation (n=1), vomiting plus diarrhoea (n=1), ischaemic stroke (n=1), and increased alanine aminotransferase (n=1). Hospital admission was prolonged in 72 (91%) of 79 serious adverse events; 75 (95%) serious adverse events were followed by recovery, four (5%) were lethal due to sepsis caused by Gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic>Enterococcous faecalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>; treatment-related mortality 5%; 95% CI 0·07–9·93). The lethal serious adverse events occurred during MATRix (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 10</xref>). There were no differences in toxicity between treatment-naive and previously treated patients: 32 serious adverse events were recorded in 16 (50%) of 32 treatment-naive patients and 47 serious adverse events were recorded in 26 (60%) of 43 previously treated patients (p=0·48); MATRix dose reductions were indicated in nine (28%) of 32 treatment-naive patients and in 15 (35%) of 43 previously treated patients (p=0·53). In the 55 patients in whom RICE was started, RICE dose reductions were indicated in five (19%) of 27 treatment-naive patients and three (11%) of 28 previously treated patients (p=0·77). MATRix was interrupted in three (9%) of 32 treatment-naive patients and six (14%) of 43 previously treated patients (p=0·54). The most common toxicities after autologous HSCT were haematological, followed by mucositis (
