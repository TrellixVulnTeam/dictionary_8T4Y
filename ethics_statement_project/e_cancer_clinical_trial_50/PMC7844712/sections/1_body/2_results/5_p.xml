<p id="para260">The 75 assessable patients received the first course of MATRix; per protocol, MATRix was preceded by debulking R-CHOP in nine (28%) of the 32 patients enrolled at original lymphoma diagnosis. Post-hoc analysis showed that 55 (73%; 95% CI 63â€“83) patients had an objective response after two courses of MATRix (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). 19 (95%) of the 20 patients who had a complete response after two courses of MATRix maintained the remission after crossing to RICE; 36 patients achieved partial tumour response as the best response during the first two courses of MATRix (one after the first course and 35 after the second one): 28 of them received the third course of MATRix and crossed to RICE, three crossed directly to RICE (protocol violation), one received the third course of MATRix and had progressive disease, and four did not receive other treatment. 24 (77%) of the 31 patients who had RICE after a partial response after two courses of MATRix maintained or improved response after RICE. Three (4%) of 75 patients had stable disease after two courses of MATRix: one received the third course of MATRix and had disease progression, one received the third course of MATRix and crossed to RICE, and one crossed directly to RICE; the last two patients had a major response and received autologous HSCT. 12 (16%) of 75 patients had progressive disease during the first two courses of MATRix (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>); per protocol, five (7%) patients crossed to RICE (preceded by a third course of MATRix in one of them), had further progressive disease, and died early; the other seven (11%) patients did not receive other treatment because they had aggressive progressive disease, with fast impairment of neurological and general conditions that impeded any further treatment. There were 19 protocol deviations (
