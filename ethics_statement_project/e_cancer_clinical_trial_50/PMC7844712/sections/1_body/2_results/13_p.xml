<p id="para340">Eight (89%) of the nine patients enrolled at initial diagnosis who received debulking R-CHOP before MATRix were relapse-free survivors at 26–47 months of follow-up (

 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 19</xref>); the 11 patients who did not receive intrathecal chemotherapy had a contraindication to lumbar puncture due to large brain lesions; only one of these patients remained relapse-free at 42 months of follow-up, with a 2-year progression-free survival of 18% (95% CI 0–36) compared with 47% (37–57) for the 64 patients who received intrathecal chemotherapy (p=0·012). The type of intrathecal chemotherapy used (conventional triple drug
