<p id="para230">R-CHOP was the first-line treatment in most of the 43 patients registered at relapse, with a median time to CNS involvement of 5 months (IQR 2â€“8). Of these 43 patients, 39 (91%) had CNS relapse during the first year of follow-up and 20 (47%) had a systemic lymphoma refractory to the previous line of treatment; refractoriness was defined as progressive disease occurring during treatment or at re-staging after the last course of chemotherapy. 13 (17%) of 75 patients had a previous indolent lymphoma (ten [13%] had follicular lymphoma, one [1%] had lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, one [1%] had marginal zone lymphoma, and one [1%] had chronic lymphocytic leukaemia); transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in the CNS was confirmed by brain biopsy in these 13 patients. Characteristics of patients with transformed lymphoma and de-novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are shown in the

The cell of origin was defined according to Hans algorithm; complete data were available for 64 (85%) patients and at least one immunostaining was absent in the other 11 (15%) patients with unclassifiable lymphomas. 38 (59%) of the 64 assessed lymphomas were non-germinal-centre-like subtype.
