<p id="para290">12 (24%) of the 49 responders were not eligible for autologous HSCT (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>); four (33%) of the 12 remained relapse-free at 18–28 months of follow-up. 37 (76%) of the 49 responders (25 complete responses; 12 partial responses) received autologous HSCT. In the 12 patients with partial responses, residual disease was in the CNS in four (33%), in systemic organs in three (25%), and in both in five (42%). Ten (83%) of the 12 patients with partial responses had a complete response after autologous HSCT; three of them received non-protocol planned, post-transplant adjuvant radiotherapy based on the decision of the physician, and the two patients with residual disease after transplantation received radiotherapy (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Including the two patients who received whole-brain radiotherapy after autologous HSCT, 13 (17%) patients received whole-brain radiotherapy as part of experimental treatment: nine received radiotherapy due to residual (five patients) or progressive (four patients) disease in the brain after or during MATRix–RICE; two patients in complete response after MATRix–RICE received whole-brain radiotherapy because they were poor mobilisers. Seven (78%) of the nine patients who received whole-brain radiotherapy to control responsive disease had a complete or partial response and only one of them had relapsing disease in the brain. None of the four patients who received whole-brain radiotherapy to control progressive disease in the brain responded; all of them died within 9 months of trial enrolment.
