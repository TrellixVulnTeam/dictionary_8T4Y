<p id="para250">Progressive and relapsing disease were very aggressive; only seven (19%) of 36 patients received salvage therapy, with no responses, and with a median survival after relapse or progression from MARIETTA treatment of 1 month (IQR 1–3). Therefore, overall survival was similar to progression-free survival in each subset of patients analysed (
