<p id="para240">At 1 year from enrolment, 42 patients were progression free; with a 1-year progression-free survival of 58% (95% CI 55–61) for the total assessable population and 100% (100–100) for the patients who received a transplant (

At a median follow-up of 29 months (IQR 20–40), 35 (47%) of the 75 assessable patients were progression free; three of them died without evidence of lymphoma relapse at 13 months (sudden death), 16 months (progressive neurological decline), and 31 months (suspected pulmonary thromboembolism). 25 (33%) of 75 patients had progressive disease during chemotherapy at every step of experimental treatment, 11 (24%) of 46 responders had tumour relapse. Most organs involved at relapse or progression were primary sites of disease (
