<p id="para330">Some post-hoc exploratory subgroup analyses were done. Univariate analyses showed that patients with CNS localisation at initial diagnosis had a significantly improved progression-free survival compared with patients with CNS involvement at relapse, with a 2-year progression free survival of 71% (95% CI 69–73) for the 32 patients enrolled at initial lymphoma diagnosis and 28% (11–47) for the 43 patients enrolled at relapse (p=0·0031;
