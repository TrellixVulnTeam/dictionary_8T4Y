<p id="para160">The primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 1 year. The secondary endpoints were overall and complete response rate before autologous HSCT, duration of response, overall survival, and safety. Progression-free survival and overall survival were estimated according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma.

 </xref> The best response achieved during experimental treatment was considered for analyses, and duration of response was estimated for patients who had a response to MATRixâ€“RICE as the time between the date of best response and the date of relapse, progressive disease, death from any cause, or last follow-up visit. Stable disease during MATRix that required crossing to RICE, or stable disease during RICE that required crossing to whole-brain radiotherapy, was not considered an event in survival analyses. The effects of treatment on patient-reported outcomes (acceptability and quality of life) were not assessed.
