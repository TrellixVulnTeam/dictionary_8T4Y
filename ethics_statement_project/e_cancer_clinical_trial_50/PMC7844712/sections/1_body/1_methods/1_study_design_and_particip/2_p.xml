<p id="para120">The main inclusion criteria were: histologically proven diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; CNS involvement (brain, meninges, cranial nerves, eyes, spinal cord, or a combination of these) at presentation (concomitant to systemic disease) or at relapse (isolated or concomitant to systemic lymphoma); age 18â€“70 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS) of 3 or less; and no previous treatment with high-dose methotrexate. Both previously untreated patients with CNS involvement at initial diagnosis and patients with CNS relapse during or after a treatment for systemic lymphoma were included. Any previous treatment for systemic lymphoma except for high-dose methotrexate or autologous or allogeneic HSCT was admitted. The upper age limit reflected the eligibility of patients to receive autologous HSCT in the participating centres. Diagnosis of CNS involvement by either brain biopsy, cerebrospinal fluid cytology examination, or neuroimaging was permitted. Patients with high-grade transformation from indolent lymphoma and patients with double-hit or triple-hit lymphoma were eligible. Patients with a previous organ transplantation or other forms of immunosuppression, HIV infection, or primary CNS lymphoma were excluded. Staging and pretreatment tests (
