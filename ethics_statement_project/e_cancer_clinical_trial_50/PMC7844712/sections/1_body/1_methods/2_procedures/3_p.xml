 </xref> The worst toxicity per organ, per course was considered. Adverse events were assessed during the visit before each course or during hospitalisation, when required. Severe adverse events are defined in the protocol (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 23</xref>). Tumour response was assessed by gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI, 
 <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET, contrast-enhanced total-body CT scan, and other examinations that were positive at baseline, after the second course of MATRix, the first course of RICE, the third course of RICE, and after autologous HSCT. Response definition of CNS disease followed the International Primary CNS Lymphoma Collaborative Group response criteria

 </xref> and extra-CNS disease followed the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma.

 </xref> The maximum response recorded from treatment start was considered for analyses and therapeutic decisions were based on local investigator assessment. After the end of treatment, the disease was assessed every 3 months for the first 2 years, and every 6 months during the third, fourth, and fifth years.
