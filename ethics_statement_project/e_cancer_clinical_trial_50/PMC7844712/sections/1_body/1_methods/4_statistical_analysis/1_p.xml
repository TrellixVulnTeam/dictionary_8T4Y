 </xref> and the minimum progression-free survival at 1 year considered of interest was 65% (alternative hypothesis). In other words, an experimental treatment associated with a 1-year progression-free survival of less than 50% would not be a suitable strategy for routine use and further research. To detect such a difference 69 patients were required (one-sided test, type I error 5%, and power 80%); with a 10% dropout, 76 patients were needed. If at least 41 patients were progression-free survivors at 1 year, the strategy would be considered effective. All registered patients were considered for primary and safety analyses except for patients who post hoc objectively did not meet the eligibility criteria, including incorrect histopathological diagnosis, concomitant cancer, or disease only at flow cytometry examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (modified intention-to-treat analysis). Patients were excluded from analyses in the case of consensus withdrawal.
