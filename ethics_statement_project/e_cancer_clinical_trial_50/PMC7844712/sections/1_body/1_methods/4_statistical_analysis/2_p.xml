<p id="para190">Progression-free survival and overall survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method, expressed with standard error, and compared through the log-rank test. 95% CI was provided for any data derived from Kaplan-Meier analyses. Time at risk started at the day of trial enrolment for all the analyses except the analysis of response to MATRix, for which the time at risk started at the date of response assessment after the first two MATRix courses.</p>
