<p>Participant data is stored on a secure server at the Istituto Oncologico della Svizzera Italiana, Bellinzona, Switzerland, where each participant has been assigned a de-identified trial number. A data dictionary will be available and will include descriptions of patient demographics, treatment, and primary outcome data. Any requests for access to the MARIETTA trial data should be sent to the sponsor (the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group; IELSG) and agreement will be made through the data access committee, which will comprise the principal investigators from the trial management group. No identifiable data (ie, name, address, hospital number, NHS number, date of birth, or any other identifying data) will be shared and should not be requested. For each data sharing request, a proforma should be completed, describing the purpose, scope, data items requested, and analysis plan. Requestors who are granted access to the data will be required to complete a data sharing agreement that will be signed by the requester, sponsor, and principal investigator or investigators and should confirm that the trial management team acknowledge the agreement. The study protocol and consent forms are available upon request from IELSG.</p>
