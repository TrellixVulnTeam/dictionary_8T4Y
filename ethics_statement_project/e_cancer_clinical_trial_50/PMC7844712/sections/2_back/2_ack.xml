  <p>The MARIETTA/IELSG42 academic trial was done without commercial funding. The study was sponsored by IELSG and was funded in part by the Stand Up To Cancer Campaign for Cancer Research UK (CRUK/14/044). The enrolment of Swiss patients was supported by the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK). The IELSG is supported by Swiss Cancer Research foundation and Swiss Cancer League. The trial chairpeople guarantee the integrity, accuracy, completeness of data analyses, and adherence to protocol. The trial had an independent, international data safety monitoring board. The chairpeople wrote the manuscript; they were not paid to write the Article. We are indebted to our patients and their families for their generous commitment. We thank the investigators, research nurses, and study coordinators at each study centre. We particularly thank haematologists, oncologists, neuroradiologists, radiation oncologists, pathologists, and psychologists from all centres for the sustained scientific collaboration. We appreciate the excellent technical assistance of the study coordinator offices of the Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (Modena and Alessandria, Italy), of Cancer Research UK (Southampton, UK), of the Erasmus MC Cancer Institute (Rotterdam, Netherlands), and of the SAKK (Bern, Switzerland), as well as the administrative support in data collection and study conduction from the clinical project manager and central study team at the IELSG Coordinating Center (Bellinzona, Switzerland). We also express gratitude to the members of the independent data monitoring board of the study.</p>
