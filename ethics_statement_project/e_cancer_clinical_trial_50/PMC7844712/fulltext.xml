At 1 year from enrolment the primary endpoint was met, 42 patients were progression free (progression-free survival 58%; 95% CI 55&#x02013;61). 49 patients (65%; 95% CI 54&#x02013;76) had an objective response after MATRix&#x02013;RICE, 29 (39%) of whom had a complete response. 37 patients who responded had autologous HSCT. At the end of the programme, 46 patients (61%; 95% CI 51&#x02013;71) had an objective response, with a median duration of objective response of 26 months (IQR 16&#x02013;37). At a median follow-up of 29 months (IQR 20&#x02013;40), 35 patients were progression-free and 33 were alive, with a 2-year overall survival of 46% (95% CI 39&#x02013;53). Grade 3&#x02013;4 toxicity was most commonly haematological: neutropenia in 46 (61%) of 75 patients, thrombocytopenia in 45 (60%), and anaemia in 26 (35%). 79 serious adverse events were recorded in 42 (56%) patients; four (5%) of those 79 were lethal due to sepsis caused by Gram-negative bacteria (treatment-related mortality 5%; 95% CI 0&#x000b7;07&#x02013;9&#x000b7;93).</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>MATRix&#x02013;RICE plus autologous HSCT was active in this population of patients with very poor prognosis, and had an acceptable toxicity profile.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Stand Up To Cancer Campaign for Cancer Research UK, the Swiss Cancer Research foundation, and the Swiss Cancer League.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p id="para10">Secondary CNS dissemination is a rare but potentially lethal event in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

Rationally designed treatment protocols should use drugs that can be delivered in a dose-intensive and time-intensive schedule and are effective at penetrating the blood&#x02013;brain barrier, such as methotrexate and cytarabine administered at high doses. On the basis of retrospective studies,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> it is believed that potential cure is only achievable if patients have autologous haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) consolidation after remission of CNS disease. Accordingly, conditioning regimens currently used in primary CNS lymphoma, which include drugs with excellent CNS penetration, such as carmustine, busulfan, and thiotepa,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> have been adopted in patients with secondary CNS lymphoma.</p><p id="para20"><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p id="para30"><bold>Evidence before this study</bold></p><p id="para40">We searched PubMed between Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 31, 2019, for prospective trials investigating the treatment of patients with secondary CNS lymphoma. We used the search terms &#x0201c;central nervous system&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;CNS&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;lymphoma&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;secondary CNS lymphoma&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;SCNSL&#x0201d;, AND &#x0201c;diffuse large B-cell lymphoma&#x0201d;, and restricted the results to articles published in English. Publications in non-English languages with abstracts in English were also considered. Abstract-only data from international meetings during the past 3 years (up to Dec 31, 2019) were considered. There is little evidence in this field; secondary CNS lymphoma is a rare lymphoma and randomised trials are not feasible, hence the paucity of data to inform practice. Existing literature comprises only three single-arm phase 2 trials including at most 38 patients. These are non-comparable trials as they have used different eligibility criteria with variation in the upper limits of age and performance status as well as in considered lymphoma entities, previous treatment, and response status in the selection of candidates for autologous haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). In addition, data on some subgroups, such as patients with CNS involvement at initial diagnosis and patients with disease refractory to the first-line treatment, are scarce because these patients were considered in only one of the published prospective studies and accounted for less than a fifth of the patients enrolled. The reviewed literature does not allow the identification of a standard treatment for patients with secondary CNS lymphoma.</p><p id="para50"><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p id="para60">To our knowledge, the MARIETTA study is the largest prospective trial focused on patients with secondary CNS lymphoma; it was done in 24 centres in four countries, representing the most geographically extensive trial to date, which supports the generalisability of the results. This trial showed that the sequential combination of MATRix (rituximab, methotrexate, cytarabine, and thiotepa) and RICE (rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide) followed by autologous HSCT was active in this population of patients with a very poor prognosis. Patients aged up to 70 years and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 3 or less were included, representing a real-world cohort of patients. The MARIETTA programme is active in every subgroup of secondary CNS lymphoma, with 1-year progression-free survival of 58% (95% CI 55&#x02013;61) and encouraging 2-year progression-free survival of 71% (63&#x02013;79) in patients with CNS disease at initial lymphoma diagnosis. Moreover, the MARIETTA programme included two standardised regimens (ie, MATRIX and RICE) used in routine practice in several countries, and showed a good safety profile.</p><p id="para70"><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p id="para80">Combined with existing evidence, the results of the MARIETTA trial show that a growing proportion of patients with secondary CNS lymphoma can have durable remissions with intensified chemoimmunotherapy. Patients with CNS disease at initial lymphoma diagnosis and patients who had CNS dissemination during or after upfront R-CHOP therapy have different outcomes, suggesting that these two populations of patients with secondary CNS lymphoma might benefit from different treatments. Patients with CNS involvement at initial diagnosis seemed to benefit from treatment with debulking R-CHOP followed by MATRix&#x02013;RICE and autologous HSCT. Further efforts are required to improve remission rates before autologous HSCT, especially in patients with CNS involvement at first relapse.</p></boxed-text></p><p id="para90">The highest level of evidence in the treatment of secondary CNS lymphoma is from three single-arm phase 2 trials on 30&#x02013;38 patients each.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> These trials are non-comparable because they used different eligibility criteria with variation in upper limits of age, performance status, included lymphoma subtypes, previous treatment, and response status in the selection of patients for autologous HSCT.

This trial showed that the sequential combination of MATRix and RICE followed by autologous HSCT was active in this population of patients with a very poor prognosis, meeting the predetermined threshold for progression-free survival, without major safety concerns. Response to MATRix was an independent favourable prognostic factor, whereas patients with MATRix-refractory disease had little benefit from crossing to RICE and autologous HSCT. Survival of patients who had a transplantation was encouraging, with significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival in chemotherapy-naive patients treated at presentation compared with patients who had CNS relapse after a first-line chemoimmunotherapy.</p><p id="para360">This trial has a few limitations. In particular, the rarity of secondary CNS lymphoma makes it difficult to do randomised trials and only single-arm phase 2 trials seem to be feasible in this patient population. Importantly, the MARIETTA trial considered patients with CNS involvement at both initial diagnosis and relapse, including patients with high-grade transformed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and both with isolated CNS relapse and concomitant CNS&#x02013;systemic disease, which might have generated an interpretation bias related to an apparent study population heterogeneity, reducing the strength of the reported associations. However, patient heterogeneity is a characteristic of this rare lymphoma, and the patients enrolled in this trial reflect the situation in routine practice, with the exception of patients older than 70 years who were excluded; thus, the use of the MARIETTA programme in older patients should be considered with caution. Moreover, studies clearly reporting the ratio between CNS involvement at presentation and at relapse in routine practice do not exist, which does not allow us to put the patient distribution in the present trial in context. However, the relatively large sample size of the MARIETTA trial allowed us to draw reliable conclusions on safety and activity in the whole study population and to distinguish different outcomes between patients with CNS disease at initial lymphoma diagnosis and patients who had CNS dissemination during or after upfront R-CHOP therapy, suggesting that these two secondary CNS lymphoma populations might benefit from different treatments. This finding is an important contribution considering that only one previous study focused on patients with CNS involvement at initial diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma exists, which included only 16 patients with this condition.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> An additional limitation was that no centralised review of imaging was done, and response and relapse assessment by local investigators of the 24 participating institutions was used as supportive evidence, which might have generated an interpretation bias. However, we can exclude a biased effect on the primary endpoint of the trial because progressive or relapsing disease is a clear condition to treating physicians, usually associated with relevant symptoms and general or neurological impairment. The MARIETTA programme was feasible, with 71% of MATRix&#x02013;RICE courses delivered, and only four (5%) patients having permanent interruptions (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 10</xref>) due to lethal sepsis. Although these rates seem to be a little better than that expected in routine practice, we cannot put these figures in context because retrospective studies on patients treated in everyday practice were not designed to answer this question. Finally, neurotoxicity was an uncommon event in patients treated with the MARIETTA programme; however, potential late cognitive decline cannot be excluded because assessment by neuropsychological tests was not included in the trial design.</p><p id="para370">When putting the MARIETTA trial in context with previous trials, we note that the study population includes a relatively large proportion of patients with a poor prognosis (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 12</xref>): 47% of patients had R-CHOP-refractory lymphoma, 80% of patients had concomitant systemic disease, and 56% had extra-CNS extranodal disease; all these are well known negative prognosticators, which makes it difficult to compare these results with previous trials (three multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 trials done in Germany,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Italy,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> and the Netherlands<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref>). The only study published at the time of design of the MARIETTA trial was used to estimate the present sample size.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> In that trial, a methotrexate&#x02013;ifosfamide combination followed by cytarabine&#x02013;thiotepa combination and autologous HSCT had been adopted in 30 patients, reporting a complete response rate after induction of 23%, and a 1-year progression-free survival of 49% for the whole population and 58% for transplanted patients. Comparison between that study and the MARIETTA trial is limited by some relevant differences in selection criteria. In the previous trial,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> the upper age limit was 65 years, with an upper limit of ECOG-PS of 2; patients with CNS involvement at initial lymphoma diagnosis were not considered, whereas patients with T-cell lymphomas were also enrolled. The SCNSL1 study<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> used similar selection criteria to those used in the MARIETTA trial. The characteristics of the 38 patients enrolled in the SCNSL1 trial are similar to those recorded for the present study population (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 12</xref>), with the exception of eligible histology (as a few patients with follicular lymphoma or mantle cell lymphoma were enrolled in the SCNSL1 trial) and, importantly, the proportion of patients with disease refractory to the previous line of treatment, which was almost three times greater in the MARIETTA trial.</p><p id="para380">The chemoimmunotherapy combination assessed in the MARIETTA trial was active in every subgroup of secondary CNS lymphoma, with the best results shown in patients with CNS disease at initial lymphoma diagnosis (43% of the enrolled participants). The SCNSL1 trial has shown a 2-year progression-free survival of 45% in a group of 16 patients with CNS disease at initial diagnosis,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> and to our knowledge no other trials have focused on this crucial subgroup of patients. In our study, we report a 2-year progression-free survival of 71% (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 11</xref>), an encouraging result considering that the 2-year progression-free survival for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma without CNS involvement treated with R-CHOP is 70&#x02013;75%.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p><p id="para390">The safety profile of the MARIETTA programme could be considered to be favourable compared with that reported in the SCNSL1 trial, which consisted of an intensified strategy associated with grade 3&#x02013;4 infections or febrile neutropenia in 24% of delivered courses (compared with 13% in the MARIETTA trial; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 10</xref>) and 11% treatment-related mortality (compared with 5% in the MARIETTA trial). Importantly, intensification high-dose sequential chemoimmunotherapy of the SCNSL1 trial is used only in selected centres in Italy, whereas MATRix and RICE are two standardised regimens that are used in routine practice in several countries. A study from June, 2020,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> shows that MATRix is used in routine practice in many cancer centres with similar activity and tolerability to that reported within prospective trials.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p><p id="para400">In conclusion, the results of the MARIETTA trial are a step forward in the treatment of secondary CNS lymphoma. In particular, progression-free survival for transplanted patients is encouraging and constitutes a good platform to discuss future strategies in this hard-to-treat patient cohort. Patients with CNS involvement at initial diagnosis seem to benefit from treatment with debulking R-CHOP followed by MATRix&#x02013;RICE and autologous HSCT. Further efforts are urgently required to improve remission before transplantation, especially in patients with CNS involvement at first relapse. Different therapies for patients with CNS involvement at presentation or relapse should be addressed in future trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="cesec100"><title>Data sharing</title><p>Participant data is stored on a secure server at the Istituto Oncologico della Svizzera Italiana, Bellinzona, Switzerland, where each participant has been assigned a de-identified trial number.

The study was sponsored by IELSG and was funded in part by the Stand Up To Cancer Campaign for Cancer Research UK (CRUK/14/044). The enrolment of Swiss patients was supported by the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK). The IELSG is supported by Swiss Cancer Research foundation and Swiss Cancer League. The trial chairpeople guarantee the integrity, accuracy, completeness of data analyses, and adherence to protocol. The trial had an independent, international data safety monitoring board. The chairpeople wrote the manuscript; they were not paid to write the Article. We are indebted to our patients and their families for their generous commitment. We thank the investigators, research nurses, and study coordinators at each study centre. We particularly thank haematologists, oncologists, neuroradiologists, radiation oncologists, pathologists, and psychologists from all centres for the sustained scientific collaboration. We appreciate the excellent technical assistance of the study coordinator offices of the Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (Modena and Alessandria, Italy), of Cancer Research UK (Southampton, UK), of the Erasmus MC Cancer Institute (Rotterdam, Netherlands), and of the SAKK (Bern, Switzerland), as well as the administrative support in data collection and study conduction from the clinical project manager and central study team at the IELSG Coordinating Center (Bellinzona, Switzerland). We also express gratitude to the members of the independent data monitoring board of the study.</p></sec></ack><ack><title>Contributors</title><p>AJMF, JKD, JECB, EZ, and KCw designed the trial, provided logistical support, verified the underlying data, wrote the manuscript, and approved submission.
