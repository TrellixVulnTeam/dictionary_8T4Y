The high-tech environment and unfamiliar nature of RT can affect the patient&#x02019;s experience of the treatment. Misconceptions or lack of knowledge about RT processes can increase levels of anxiety and enhance feelings of being unprepared at the beginning of treatment. Moreover, the waiting time is often quite long. The primary aim of this study will be to evaluate whether a digital information tool with VR-technology and preparatory information can decrease distress as well as enhance the self-efficacy and health literacy of patients affected by breast cancer before, during, and after RT. A secondary aim will be to explore whether the digital information tool increase patient flow while maintaining or increasing the quality of care.
</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p id="Par2">The study is a prospective and longitudinal RCT study with an Action Research participatory design approach including mixed-methods data collection, i.e., standardised instruments, qualitative interviews (face-to-face and telephone) with a phenomenological hermeneutical approach, diaries, observations, and time measurements, and scheduled to take place from autumn 2020 to spring 2022. The intervention group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;80), will receive standard care and information (oral and written) and the digital information tool; and the control group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;80), will receive standard care and information (oral and written). Study recruitment and randomisation will be completed at two centres in the west of Sweden.
</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Research in this area is scarce and, to our knowledge, only few previous studies examine VR as a tool for increasing preparedness for patients with breast cancer about to undergo RT that also includes follow-ups six months after completed treatment. The participatory approach and design will safeguard the possibilities to capture the patient perspective throughout the development process, and the RCT design supports high research quality. Digitalisation brings new possibilities to provide safe, person-centred information that also displays a realistic picture of RT treatment and its contexts. The planned study will generate generalisable knowledge of relevance in similar health care contexts.</p><p id="Par4"><italic>Trial registration</italic>: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04394325.

In 2019, the Swedish national cancer register recorded 9225 cases of breast cancer; 9157 women and 68 men (0.7%). The incidence rate of breast cancer in Sweden is expected to continue to rise, due to an increase in both the general and ageing population numbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Radiation Therapy (RT) is a common treatment (received by 75&#x02013;80% of breast cancer patients) after surgery and is a complex process based on the use of high energy X-rays to eradicate cancer cells, important in reducing the risk of local recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. While the RT procedure itself takes only a few minutes and is painless, it requires meticulous preparation and patients then need to attend the RT treatment centre 5&#x000a0;days a week for up to 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;weeks. Moreover, in Sweden, the waiting time is often quite long, sometimes up to 10&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The high-tech environment and unfamiliar nature of RT can affect the patient&#x02019;s experience of the treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, misconceptions or a lack of knowledge about RT processes can increase their levels of anxiety and enhance feelings of being unprepared at the beginning of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Having received correct information about future treatment may enable patients to realistically assess advantages and disadvantages as well as foresee possible treatment results. This may in turn create a feeling of increased knowledge and security as well as reduce distress for the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A number of Swedish acts state that the healthcare system must provide each patient with individually tailored information and the opportunity to choose between different treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] or stipulate that healthcare providers should actively ensure that the information has been received and understood by the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Having a person-centred approach to information provision and communication means to enhance shared decision making, seeing the person as a capable individual who wants to adapt generic information to his or her social context and experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">When informing patients, their health literacy must also be considered, i.e., their ability to acquire, understand, and use information about their health, including that related to cognitive and social functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Health literacy can be seen as being dynamic, and hence can fluctuate, depending on the state of the individual, the situation, the culture, or the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Self-efficacy, referring to a persons&#x02019; belief in his/her ability to deal with specific situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] such as in this case a cancer diagnosis, treatments, and transitioning to survivorship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Cancer patients&#x02019; perceived self&#x02010;efficacy may directly or indirectly affect health behaviours, lifestyle adjustments and psychological growth, psychological distress, and physical outcomes, as well as quality of life (QoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Psychosocial distress may appear early in the diagnostic process and can have negative effects on compliance with treatment and subsequent quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">There is a need for new ways to inform and involve patients, hence there is a strong call for digitalized tools to be used in healthcare. To be effective, however, digital tools must be developed based on research that also follows quality standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. More and more, patients request they are provided information through videos, accessible for later review at home and for sharing with loved ones, as many patients travel substantial distances to receive care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, videos and audio-visual materials have proven to be successful communication tools and the format also supports the distribution and sharing of information with others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Virtual reality (VR) has the inherent potential to be interactive because its content is generated in real time, not ahead of time, which makes the experience even more immersive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Specifically, VR differs from other forms of media because it induces the sense of &#x0201c;presence&#x0201d;, i.e., the feeling of &#x0201c;being there&#x0201d; inside the virtual experience produced by the technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. VR-interventions for cancer patients were investigated in a meta-analysis by Zeng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], showing its effects on improved learning through cognitive training and significantly decreased fatigue. A recent study indicated that a virtual reality education for breast cancer patients could improve RT knowledge and perhaps decrease anxiety as well as was appreciated by the patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Moreover, virtual reality radiotherapy educational program could have a positive effect on patients prior to their initial RT session by providing them with useful content and decreasing their anxiety about the process, thus increasing the patient RT comprehension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">In another study, the majority (86%) of the participants considered that the information they received did not provide them with an adequate understanding of the treatment and what it entailed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Participants identified potential benefits of VR video viewing before the first day of treatment and felt that it could increase understanding of the treatment process, specifically the spatial and acoustic aspects of treatment. The authors concluded that a VR education tool has the potential to enhance standard patient education, increasing understanding of treatment and decreasing anxiety.</p><p id="Par22">However, the potential outcomes related to Health Literacy are scarcely evaluated. Moreover, most studies were of relatively low methodological quality or pilot studies and the need for research of more robust study design and larger sample sizes has been identified.</p><p id="Par23">The primary aim of this study will be to evaluate whether a digital information tool with VR-technology and preparatory information can decrease distress as well as enhance the self-efficacy and health literacy of patients affected by breast cancer before, during, and after RT.

These individual in-depth and/or telephone interviews will take place on two occasions (1&#x02013;4&#x000a0;weeks and 6&#x000a0;months post-RT completion) and with at least ten of the patients who have accepted participation and have made regular notes. Questions will include topics such as their experiences of receiving the information through the digital information tool during the waiting time and treatment period, of using the digital information tool, to what extent the digital information has affected their involvement and preparedness for the radiation treatment, as well as their experiences during the time since the end of RT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Quantitative data</title><p id="Par39">Data will be analysed descriptively taking the level of scale into consideration, i.e., using mean (m) and standard deviation (SD) when relevant, or, otherwise, median (md) and range. Group comparison at each point in time will be completed using relevant parametric or non-parametric methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. <italic>P </italic>values&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Generalized linear models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] will be used to analyse differences between groups and for repeated measures over time for the continuous variables, while nominal (categorical) variables will be tested with chi-square test (exact).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Qualitative data</title><p id="Par40">A phenomenological hermeneutical approach, with a focus on the essence and the underlying meaning in the lived experience of receiving RT, will be applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Narratives, in the form of notebook texts, recorded by the participants, and in-depth interviews that encompasses descriptions and expressions of the person&#x000b4;s lived experiences of the phenomenon will be analysed. The analysis involves three steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]: (1) the na&#x000ef;ve reading, where the text is read numerous times and the researchers initial understanding of the text is written down. (2) The structural analyses, where the text is broken down into meaning units, that embody information about the phenomenon of interest. (3) The comprehensive understanding, in which the text is considered in its entirety, and the findings from the first and second steps, are brought together with the researchers pre-understanding, and discussed in relation to relevant literature.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par41">Research in this area is scarce and, few other studies have examined VR as a tool for increasing preparedness for patients with breast cancer about to undergo RT that also includes follow-ups up to six months after completed treatment. Previous studies on VR for the same purpose are small e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], while yet including a control and intervention group. Other studies such as [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] that intends to improve patient education for patient with RT, are not based on VR tools.</p><p id="Par42">The participatory approach and design will safeguard the possibilities to capture the patient perspective throughout the development process, and the RCT design supports high research quality. Because the project utilises rather novel technology, it is clearly important to include patient perspectives to ensure that persons with less digital competence are not deprived of or alienated from the information. Patients diagnosed with breast cancer of different ages will be included. This will likely provide us with a sample representing persons of different experiences and variations in life situations and self-efficacy, as well as in their digital competence and health literacy. Such diversity is important to generate as broad a knowledge base as possible for the design of future research projects with different cancer diagnoses and clinical decision-making in relation to RT. The outcomes of this project will be put to practical use, both during and after the research period. The project will contribute to clinical cancer research and innovation by leading to better informed and better prepared patients. Using the waiting time actively as a part of the process of preparing can make this period more meaningful for the patient.</p><p id="Par43">The digital information tools utilised in the present project are also likely to add value to patients&#x02019; next-of-kin, by providing a more concrete picture of the treatment and its context. This brings unique possibilities for an unlimited number of next-of-kin of all ages to better understand what their mother, sister, daughter, friend, etc. is experiencing. This will in turn increase the psychosocial support provided to patients and loved ones, thus strengthening the patients&#x02019; position in cancer care. The VR innovation creates opportunities for improving care processes and levelling uneven structures. The project may also improve the efficiency of RT by leading to well-prepared patients. The mobile applications can be regarded as an accessible and convenient platform that enables the person to gain instant knowledge and guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">Because the participatory design builds on collaboration with patients, as well as staff, it will also generate knowledge and a digital information tool that will be easy to implement in clinical practice in similar settings. Moreover, participatory designs support the three Rs of research; namely, to enhance rigor, assure relevance, and ensure a greater as well as broader reach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par45">. This study will tell us whether a digital information tool with VR-technology and preparatory information can decrease distress as well as enhance self-efficacy and health literacy of patients with a breast cancer about to receive RT. It will also indicate whether a digital information tool can increase patient flow while maintaining or increasing the quality of care. The planned study will generate generalisable knowledge of relevance in similar health care settings and for patients with other diagnosis of cancer about to receive RT.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>App</term><def><p id="Par5">Software applications</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AR</term><def><p id="Par6">Action Research</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DIS-A</term><def><p id="Par7">The NCCN Distress Thermometer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>eHLQ</term><def><p id="Par8">The eHealth Literacy Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GSES</term><def><p id="Par9">The Swedish version of the General Self-efficacy Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>M</term><def><p id="Par10">Mean</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QoL</term><def><p id="Par11">Quality of Life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p id="Par12">Randomised Control Trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RT</term><def><p id="Par13">Radiation Therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par14">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VR</term><def><p id="Par15">Virtual reality</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We appreciate the support from Regional Cancer Centre West, the Radiation Therapy Department at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden when designing this future study.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All (SF, FS, AG and MB) authors took part in designing the study and writing the study protocol, as well as read and approved the submitted version.
