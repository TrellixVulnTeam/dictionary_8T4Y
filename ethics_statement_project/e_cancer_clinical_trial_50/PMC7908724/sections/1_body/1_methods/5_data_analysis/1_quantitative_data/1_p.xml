<p id="Par39">Data will be analysed descriptively taking the level of scale into consideration, i.e., using mean (m) and standard deviation (SD) when relevant, or, otherwise, median (md) and range. Group comparison at each point in time will be completed using relevant parametric or non-parametric methods [

 <italic>P </italic>values &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Generalized linear models [
