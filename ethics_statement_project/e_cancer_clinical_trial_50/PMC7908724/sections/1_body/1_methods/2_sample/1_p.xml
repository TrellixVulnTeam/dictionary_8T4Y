<p id="Par25">Adult patients (&gt; 18 years) diagnosed with breast cancer, stage I–II, who are not receiving adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy or anti-Her-2 treatment and with RT as additional treatment after surgery, will be consecutively included during the planned post-operative visit to the surgical clinic. They will also need the ability to read, write, and understand Swedish to adhere to the digital information tool and the data collection instruments, and have access to a smartphone or a tablet. Patients responding to these inclusion criteria will be consecutively asked to participate at the post-surgery follow-up visit and receive information (oral and written) about the study. After providing their signed informed consent, participants will be randomized to either the intervention group (A) or the control group (B) by drawing a note (marked with group A or B) for each participant from a black box. Randomization will be stratified by hospital, and a total of 80 participants will be finally included at each hospital (40 in each group). The participants in the intervention group will receive oral and written information regarding the digital information tool.</p>
