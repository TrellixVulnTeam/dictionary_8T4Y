<p id="Par38">Approximately 30 patients (in group A) will be strategically asked to participate in the qualitative part of the study. The patients will be asked to make notes in a notebook during the waiting period prior to the start of RT as well as during the RT treatment period. The participants will be encouraged to write reflections with a focus on the support, guidance, and information they receive from healthcare professionals, relatives, and the digital information tool in these notebooks. In the first week of RT treatment, patients will submit their diaries to the researchers. The text in the notebooks will be read and summarized to support the development of in-depth questions for upcoming individual interviews. These individual in-depth and/or telephone interviews will take place on two occasions (1–4 weeks and 6 months post-RT completion) and with at least ten of the patients who have accepted participation and have made regular notes. Questions will include topics such as their experiences of receiving the information through the digital information tool during the waiting time and treatment period, of using the digital information tool, to what extent the digital information has affected their involvement and preparedness for the radiation treatment, as well as their experiences during the time since the end of RT.</p>
