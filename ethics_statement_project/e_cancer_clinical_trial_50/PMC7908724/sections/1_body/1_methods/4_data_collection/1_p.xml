<p id="Par30">Socio-demographic data concerning age, marital status, number of persons in household, level of education, working/retired/sick leave, stage of disease, co-morbidities, and treatment will be gathered from the patients and/or their medical charts. The instruments for data collection will be administrated in person or by post at the baseline collection, and by post (including a pre-paid return envelope) on consecutive collections (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Two reminders will be sent for each data collection, separated two weeks in time if necessary. Data will be coded and manually entered in SPSS. The SPSS database will be stored on a secure digital storage (JU share files) at Jönköping University.
