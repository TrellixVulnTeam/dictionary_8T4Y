<p id="Par16">Clinical trials are often considered the golden standard in efficacy research, due to several strengths by design with respect to internal validity. In contrast, whether findings from clinical trials are adequately translated to clinical practice also depends on their external validity. External validity is the extent to which findings from one study are applicable to target populations not represented in the actual study population. To properly gauge the actual study population, it is crucial that clinical trials explicitly report the setting of the trial, the exact intervention, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the characteristics of the actually recruited population [

The judgement whether that vaccine will be also effective in other settings, i.e. external validity, is based on prior knowledge, biological plausibility, statistical considerations and eligibility criteria of the original trial [
