<p id="Par17">The population of the Rotterdam Study is a lower-middle class population of primarily European descent. Previously, this population has shown good generalizability to the population of the Netherlands [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Another important metric in this regard is the response rate, which has continuously exceeded 70% for the Rotterdam Study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This is a major strength of our study which makes it not only population-based but also population-representative, and far exceeds response rates for other larger efforts ongoing worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Notwithstanding these considerations, the drastic drop in eligibility for the stricter criterion in the second analysis would likely have been of the same magnitude in any other population, irrespective of geographical or ethnic setting or response rate.
