<p id="Par8">We carried out our analyses in the population-based Rotterdam Study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and used data collected from 2009 to 2014, which yielded 7162 persons (mean age 70Â years (SD 9.8), 58% women) for analysis (Online Resource Table 1). These calendar-years were chosen such to maximize the number of living participants as well as their available data. Data on the comorbidities was ascertained during the in-person examinations complemented by automated linkage of medical and pharmacy records to our study database.
