The program allows patients to infuse intravenous augmentation therapy at home by qualified nurses in continuous contact with the referring physician. Fourteen patients in treatment for over one year and two patients with recent treatment initiation were placed in patient support program. The procedures involved in administering home-based intravenous therapy with AATD were the same as in the hospital. An experienced nurse wearing adequate personal protective equipment measured the vital signs, then proceeded to prepare the therapy to be administered. The therapy was administered intravenously according to the schedule. The operator remained at the patient's home throughout the administration. In the end, the vital parameters were checked again and, finally, the venous access removed. The Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) was not used in all its length.

Students were asked to design handwashing advertisements stressing that the good handwashing requires 20 s of scrubbing with soap. The advertisements were then placed throughout the campus (student union eatery and bathrooms). Central to the campaign were handwashing demonstrations. For this, several portable handwashing stations were rented so proper handwashing techniques could be demonstrated using Glitterbug potion and viewing stations (Brevis Corporation). For the vaccine portion of the campaign, groups of 2–4 students were assigned one of four vaccines: MMR, meningitis, human papilloma virus, or influenza, to research and present to the class. From their research, students were asked to develop multiple-choice or true/false questions that could be used as trivia questions during the campaign. Survey questions were developed to understand participants’ views regarding handwashing and vaccinations. Handwashing surveys asked when students washed their hands after five daily activities, how long they wash their hands, four agree/disagree statements, and two questions regarding hand sanitizers for a total of 13 questions. Vaccine surveys contained five agree/disagree statements and 11 yes/no questions that focused on some general thoughts toward vaccination programs, an understanding of the term herd immunity, and some specific questions regarding the flu, measles, meningitis, and HPV vaccines (these were chosen because they are either required or highly recommended before attending college).
