Firstly, clinical concepts were identified in this study using the UMLS ontology through a dictionary matching approach for named entity recognition (NER). Although this approach is straightforward in its implementation, it suffers from various limitations such as false positives caused by the ambiguity of names and false negatives created by differences in spelling and synonymous concepts

First, there are a number of factors that do not lend themselves to quantification, including the psychological and quality-of-life effects of trial participation for individuals with cancer and their families. Some of these factors might have economic consequences (e.g., stress effects on work attendance and performance), and others might predominantly affect quality of life. To the extent that patients prefer care closer to home and there are no significant differences in health outcomes across treatment sites, these unquantified effects likely mean our economic effects are underestimated. Additionally, we captured only short-term effects of the enhanced clinical trial network. Data are not readily available for longer-term effects, which might include more expertise and collaboration in cancer treatment, more capacity for cancer prevention and early detection, and higher cancer survival rates. Finally, the enhanced clinical trial network might induce residents of other states to travel to Kansas for cancer care, increasing medical and travel-related spending in the state. All of these factors could lead to an actual economic impact that is larger than the estimates presented.","[First, Kansas]","['ORDINAL', 'GPE']","[61, 1068]","[66, 1074]",False
