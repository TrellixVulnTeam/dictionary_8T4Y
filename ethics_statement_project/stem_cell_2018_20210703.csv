In the intensive pathway, patients were randomised to receive cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone (CVAD) or oral cyclophosphamide, thalidomide and dexamethasone (CTD) followed by high dose melphalan plus autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). In the non‐intensive pathway, the randomisation was to attenuated CTD (CTDa) or melphalan and prednisolone (MP).

All patients diagnosed with CLL according to the World Health Organization criteria from 2007 to 2013 were identified from the National Cancer Registry. A representative physician from each of Sweden’s six health-care regions reviewed all the patient files in the region to identify patients who had received first-line CLL treatment due to progressive, symptomatic CLL. Patients who had started therapy before the end of 2013 were included in order to obtain sufficient follow up. Their files were analyzed in detail from the date of diagnosis until death or until the end of the study period (2017), whichever came first. Patients who had only received treatment for autoimmune hemolysis or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) not related to progressive CLL were excluded. As this was a retrospective observational study, ethics committee approval (2013/952–31/3) was obtained; in Sweden no informed patient consent was required.
