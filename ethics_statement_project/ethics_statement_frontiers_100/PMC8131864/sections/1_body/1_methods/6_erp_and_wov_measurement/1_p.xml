<p>ERP and WOV at LSPV, LIPV, and LAA were measured under baseline, LSGP stimulation alone, LSGP stimulation + low-level VOM stimulation, LSGP stimulation+ atropine administration, VOM ethanol infusion alone, and VOM ethanol infusion+ LSGP stimulation respectively. ERP was measured by an incremental technique, with 2-ms steps at basic drive cycle lengths of 500 ms for eight beats. ERP was measured with a drive train of eight stimuli (S1 = 400 ms) at twice the diastolic threshold, followed by a single premature stimulus (S2) coupled with increments of 10 ms until local ERP was reached. Atrial ERP was defined as the longest S
 <sub>1</sub>-S
 <sub>2</sub> coupling interval that failed to produce a propagated response. We used the WOV as a quantitative measure of AF inducibility. During ERP measurements, if AF was induced by decremental S1-S2 stimulation, the longest and the shortest S1-S2 interval (in ms) at which AF was induced were then determined. The difference between the two was designated as the WOV. AF was defined as â‰¥2 s of atrial activity appearing as fibrillatory waves on the surface ECG. Whereas, ERP dispersion was defined as the coefficient of variation (standard deviation/ mean) of the ERP at LSPV, LIPV, and LAA Sites.
