<p>We first defined the stimulation threshold for each dog by stimulating the VOM at 13 Hz (450-μs pulse duration). The stimulus amplitude (V) that elicited an abrupt decrease of heart rate by &gt;20% from baseline or caused AV conduction block was defined as the stimulation threshold. We then programmed the pacemaker output to 1 V below the stimulation threshold and confirmed that this stimulus voltage (4 ± 2 V, range 1–6 V) did not cause any changes in heart rate. The stimulation parameters chosen resulted in no serious adverse reactions (
