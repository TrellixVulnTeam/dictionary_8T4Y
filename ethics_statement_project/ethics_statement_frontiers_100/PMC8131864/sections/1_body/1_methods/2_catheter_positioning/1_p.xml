<p>All underwent a left lateral thoracotomy at the fourth intercostal space and the pericardium was opened to expose the left atrial appendage (LAA) and the base of the left ventricle. At the lateral aspect of the LAA, the LOM as a prominent fold was clearly visualized. A mapping electrode catheter was positioned, and sutured to fix it in position at the left superior pulmonary vein (LSPV), left inferior pulmonary vein (LIPV), and LAA to promote the recording of the signals to estimate the effective refractory period (ERP) and window of vulnerability (WOV). In addition, electrodes were deployed for stimulation purposes at the VOM and left superior ganglionated plexi (LSGP). All catheters were manufactured by Cordis, Biosense Webster, Inc. (Diamond Bar, CA) as shown in
