<p>Selective cannulation of the VOM was reliably achieved by introducing a left internal mammary artery catheter in the coronary sinus, engaging the VOM ostium. Through the catheter, an angioplasty wire and a balloon catheter (2 mm Ã— 8 mm) were advanced into the VOM. The balloon was inflated at the ostium of the VOM and selective VOM venograms were obtained. Substantial anatomical variations were present in the length and caliber of the VOM. The angioplasty balloon was then inflated at the ostium of the VOM and 5 cc of 100% ethanol was delivered over 2 min through the balloon lumen.</p>
