<p>The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Dalian Medical University approved the experimental protocol in advance. Seven adult mongrel dogs (10â€“15 kg each) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (150 mg/kg intravenously). The dogs were ventilated with a constant volume-cycled respirator through a cuffed endotracheal tube, and blood oxygen saturation was maintained above 95%. The temperature and illumination of the operating room were kept stable throughout the experiment. Standard ECG leads II and aVR was continuously monitored (Prucka 7000; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). All dogs were administered propranolol, initially a loading dosage of 2-mg/kg bolus, and subsequently a maintenance dosage of 2 mg/kg per hour to inhibit sympathetic activity. All the mongrel dogs continuously underwent the standard procedure as represented in
