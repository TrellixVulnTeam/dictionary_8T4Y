<p>Two pairs of electrodes were embedded in the caudal end of the LSGP for stimulation. A rectangular pulse was delivered through a constant voltage stimulator at 20 Hz with a pulse width of 2 ms by a programmable stimulator (RST-2, Huanan Medical, Hunan, China). The LSGP stimulation threshold was defined as the voltage level that could decrease the heart rate (HR) by 30% or result in a 2:1 atrioventricular block. The threshold voltage√ó2 was used to test the atrial ERP.</p>
