<p>The vein of Marshall (VOM) and ligament of Marshall (LOM) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AF. Both VOM and LOM, sources of initiating triggers (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), and vehicles of parasympathetic (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and sympathetic (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) innervations that modulate electrical properties of atrial tissue, contribute to AF maintenance (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Animal and human studies have shown that the VOM and LOM is a potential therapeutic target (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) for AF. In the past, high-frequency stimulation (HFS) in the LOM (without exciting the atrial myocardium) led to induction of AF, and this induction was inhibited by esmolol and atropine administration, suggesting the involvement of autonomic mediation (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Here, we hypothesized that VOM, as a key inter-communication pathway of GP, may play an important role in the development of vagal-related AF. Therefore, this study was carried out to reduce AF vulnerability by evaluating the effect of VOM ethanol infusion to the intrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous system.
