<p>The concept of vagal atrial fibrillation (AF) was first put forward by Coumel, who suggested that the autonomic nervous system plays a pathophysiological role in a subset of patients with AF (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). This was further supported in experiments by Liu and Nattel, whose work demonstrated a shortening of the action potential and refractory period creating heterogeneity across the atrial wall and a substrate for re-entrant arrhythmogenesis (

Recently, intrinsic cardiac nerves (ICNs) and their associated ganglionated plexi (GP) have emerged as potential anatomical sites for the initiation and maintenance of AF by involving the parasympathetic nervous system. Stimulation of these areas can trigger AF in humans (

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Besides, high-frequency stimulation of GP at the pulmonary vein can induce ectopy and AF (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Other studies in human subjects documented shifts in autonomic tone toward vagal predominance in the initiation of paroxysmal AF (potentially following an initial sympathetic surge), and eventually enhances the occurrence of ectopy at the site of the pulmonary veins (
