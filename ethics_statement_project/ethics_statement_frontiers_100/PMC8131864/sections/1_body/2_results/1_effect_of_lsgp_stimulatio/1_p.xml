<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, LSGP stimulation markedly decreased the ERP in LSPV (98.6±9.0 ms vs. 131.43 ± 6.9ms, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), LIPV (98.6 ± 13.5 ms vs. 121.4 ± 13.5 ms, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.016), and LAA (88.6 ± 21.2 ms vs. 114.3 ± 15.1 ms, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.067). Meanwhile, the ERP dispersion and WOV were increased significantly after LSGP stimulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The ERP dispersion increased from 0.10 ± 0.04 to 0.16 ± 0.08 with a 
 <italic>P</italic>-value of 0.032. Also, the WOV at LSPV, LIPV, and LAA was significantly prolonged after LSGP stimulation from 1.4±3.8 ms, 0 ms, to 4.3 ± 5.4 ms in the baseline state to 50 ± 8.2 ms, 41.4 ± 12.2 ms, and 54.3 ± 11.3 ms, respectively.
