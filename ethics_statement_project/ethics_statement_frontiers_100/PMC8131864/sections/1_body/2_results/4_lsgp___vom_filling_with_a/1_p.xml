<p>There was no significant difference in baseline ERP in LAA before (114.3 ± 15.1 ms) and after VOM filling. Likewise, LSGP fails to significantly shorten the ERP in LAA (107.1 ± 18.6 ms) when VOM was filled with alcohol. Also, the baseline WOV was not significantly changed after VOM filling in LSPV (1.4 ± 3.8 vs. 0 ms) and LIPV (0 vs. 0 ms). However, the WOV slightly increased in LAA after VOM filling (14.3 ± 9.8 vs. 4.3 ± 5.4ms). LSGP stimulation was also unable to significantly prolong the VOM in LSPV (0 vs. 0 ms), LIPV (0 vs. 0 ms), and LAA (14.3 ± 9.8 vs. 18.6 ± 7.0).</p>
