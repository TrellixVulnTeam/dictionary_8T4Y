<p>In comparison with the ERP measured from LSGP alone, the addition of atropine to LSGP slightly shorten the ERP from 131.4 ± 6.90 ms, 121.4 ± 13.5 ms, and 114.3 ± 15.2 ms to 118.6 ± 10.7 ms, 114.3 ± 9.8 ms, and 100.0 ± 19.2 ms in LSPV, LIPV, and LAA respectively. However, there were no significant differences in ERP. The growth rate in ERP dispersion (0.12 ± 0.06) and WOV was significantly reduced when atropine administration was added to LSGP stimulation.</p>
