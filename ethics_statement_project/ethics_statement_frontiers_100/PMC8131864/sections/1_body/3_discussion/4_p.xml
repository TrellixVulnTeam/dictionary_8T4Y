<p>The vagus nerve has been proved to exert inhibitory control over the autonomic ganglia and autonomic neuromodulation. A shred of evidence reported that low-level vagus nerve stimulation could inhibit the activity of the autonomic ganglia and reverses acute electrical atrial remodeling during rapid atrial pacing (

Although the exact downstream targets of LLVNS remain to be determined, there is preliminary evidence that the involvement of the antiadrenergic neuropeptide vasostatin-1 (
