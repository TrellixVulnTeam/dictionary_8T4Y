<p>The intrinsic cardiac nervous system harbors clusters of neurons, the GP, which innervate the neighboring atrial myocardium and control their electrophysiological properties (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). As shown in our study, LSGP stimulation markedly decreased the ERP while significantly increased the ERP dispersion and WOV, which is consistent with previous studies. The result of our study demonstrates that cardiac autonomic nerves and GPs play an important role in the initiation and maintenance mechanisms of AF (

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), and GP ablation that could damage various nerve structures, myocardium, and other non-neuronal structures is not highly recommended as it leads to proarrhythmia in return (
