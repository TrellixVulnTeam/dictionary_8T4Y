<p>TopClosure® reduces shear stress by means of its wide area of attachment to the skin. Dynamic stretching of the skin is through both repeated low-tension mechanical creep and fast high-tension stress relaxation using deep tension sutures (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The APs serve as a tension-relief platform for tension sutures when high tension is indicated to avoid damage to the underlying skin (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Skin ischemia is substantially reduced by placing the APs on intact skin (non-traumatized and non-undermined) 3–4 cm from the wound edges and by avoidance of any undermining of the skin (unnecessary as the tension relief system already pulls the skin edges together, and discouraged so that blood supply to the skin is optimal and any new potential space for infection or fluid collection is obliterated).
