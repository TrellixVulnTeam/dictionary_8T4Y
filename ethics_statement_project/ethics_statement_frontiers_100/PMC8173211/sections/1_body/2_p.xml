<p>A low-pressure vacuum was applied using the Vcare α
 <sup>®</sup> set to 50 mmHg (oscillating between 40 and 60 mmHg) to reduce the risk of bleeding and fistulation. The primary function of the vacuum in this application was to decontaminate the wound and evacuate fluid rather than promote angiogenesis and granulation. With the wound dressed, slow skin stretching by mechanical creep was performed daily by tightening the AS at the bedside without the need for frequent dressing changes. Serum gentamicin levels were checked routinely and remained within the normal range.
