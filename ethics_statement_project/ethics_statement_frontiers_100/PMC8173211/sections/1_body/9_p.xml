<p>In this patient, simplifying primary wound closure avoided the morbidity of an open abdomen and hastened recovery. The patient did not require postoperative ventilationâ€”avoiding associated pulmonary and circulatory complications. Nasogastric feeding was commenced immediately after surgery. Recovery was pain-free and thus, early mobilization and return to normal bowel function were facilitated. Obliteration of any residual wound cavity and complications of seroma were dealt with using the same apparatus and technique. This relatively simple procedure does not require advanced operating theater apparatus.</p>
