<p>The left abdominal wall was stretched across to the right using 1/0 nylon tension sutures running over nine of twelve TopClosure® attachment plates (AP) (IVT Medical Ltd, Ra'anna, Israel) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>–insert). Approximation of ~95% of the wound was achieved by stress relaxation within 85 min, leaving a central 3.5 × 8 cm (28 cm
 <sup>2</sup>) defect, bridged by three APs to be pulled together gradually postoperatively by their connecting approximation straps (AS) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). A soft, compressible open-cell sponge, a component of the Vcare α
 <sup>®</sup> system (IVT Medical Ltd., Ra'anna, Israel) was placed in the defect–the impermeable polyurethane layer in apposition with the Vicryl mesh–pushing down to obliterate a potential dead-space and protect the bowel from direct contact with the sponge to avoid fistulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1E,F</xref>). A few slits (fenestrations) were cut into the impermeable layer to permit evacuation of intraperitoneal fluid. An irrigation catheter for continuous 
 <italic>in-situ</italic> ultra-high dose antibiotic (CITA) (160 mg gentamicin in 100 ml saline/24 h) was placed over the Vicryl mesh and directed toward the costal margin to promote dispersion of antibiotic solution throughout the wound cavity. Regulated oxygen and irrigation–negative pressure-assisted therapy (ROI-NPT) tubes were sited at opposite limits of the wound to create unidirectional, three-dimensional flow (
