<p>The Vcare α
 <sup>®</sup> is an advanced vacuum therapy system which may be combined with simultaneous regulated oxygen and irrigation with safety features. These safety features include software that requires the operator to define the risk of bleeding (high, medium, or low) and, as a result, select a program with pre-determined vacuum pressure settings and corresponding alarm features. Sensors in the Vcare α
 <sup>®</sup> system detect filling of the Vcare α
 <sup>®</sup> canister. When specified rates are exceeded (as in the case of bleeding), audio and visual alarms and automatic cessation of the vacuum are triggered. This feature is augmented by the use of a semi-transparent (off-white) sponge that permits easy visualization of bleeding (and infection). Supplemental oxygen reverses the reduced partial pressure of oxygen in the wound induced by conventional vacuum systems, and may inhibit anaerobic bacterial growth (
