<p>At 6 weeks follow up, a central discharging seroma was evident at the lateral aspect of the original defect adjacent to the right iliac crest (where there was no adjoining/overlying tissue). The wound was partially reopened, irrigated, and a sponge cylinder inserted with an antibiotic irrigation catheter as before. Two new AP sets were applied across the defect to close the wound in stages, and ROI-NPT reinstituted for another 2 weeks until complete closure.</p>
