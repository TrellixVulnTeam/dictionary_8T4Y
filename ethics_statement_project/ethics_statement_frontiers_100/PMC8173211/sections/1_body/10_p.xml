<p>The application of TopClosureÂ® may circumvent the open abdomen in patients left with massive abdominal wall defects at the end of laparotomy by dynamic stretching. Thus, complications associated with prolonged intubation and ventilation, fluid balance, the catabolic state, wound infection, abdominal fluid and protein loss, further loss of abdominal wall domain, and development of enteroatmospheric fistula are avoided (

Complete or near complete approximation of wounds at first-stage surgery renders TRS and ROI-NPT a damage control technique that permits extensive surgery in patients with advanced malignancy, infection, or significant potential morbidity who might otherwise be advised against surgical intervention.
