<p>Median time until viral clearance was similar for males and females (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and showed an increasing, though nonsignificant, trend across increasing age categories from 11 days in individuals of 0–29 years to 13 days in individuals of ≥60 years. Symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals had the same median time till viral clearance of 11 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.491) days. To adjust for effects of age and sex, we computed hazards of viral clearance among the study subjects (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and did not see any difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (hazard ratio for symptomatic individuals compared with asymptomatic ones = 1.08, 85% CI = 0.7–1.5).
