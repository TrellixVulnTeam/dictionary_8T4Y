<p>Information on reported COVID-19 symptoms was gathered from the study subjects who underwent nasopharyngeal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. After screening, all of the study subjects served mandatory quarantine in isolation wards (or hospitals, when symptomatic), until viral clearance occurred—defined as two consecutive negative RT-PCR test results 24 h apart. We used Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA) TaqPath 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix, CG on the Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) 7500 Fast Dx RealTime PCR Instrument for conducting the PCR assay. The E gene was used and targeted for the assay, and when detected, the test was confirmed by RdRP and N genes. E gene Ct values &gt; 40 were considered negative. For quality control, both positive and negative controls were used. Time until viral clearance was ascertained by testing the individuals every 2 days till viral clearance occurred. Any individuals who developed symptoms while undergoing quarantine were counted as symptomatic.</p>
