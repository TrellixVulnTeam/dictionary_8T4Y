<p>Age, sex, and presence of symptoms in the participants have been reported as proportions. Odds of being symptomatic were estimated using a logistic regression model, which was adjusted for categories of age and sex.

Hazards of viral clearance were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model.</p>
