<p>Asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections remain highly under-diagnosed (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and are partly responsible for the recent uptick in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases following the reopening of business, universities, and schools around the globe, especially in the United States (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and the United Kingdom (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Initial studies on asymptomatic spread report that it accounts for 6% to 30% of SARS-CoV-2 infections in various settings (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Although median time till viral clearance in symptomatic individuals has been reported to be between 10 and 14 days (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), time kinetics of viral clearance and the duration of infectiousness in asymptomatic individuals remains poorly understood. The present analysis aimed to estimate time till viral clearance in asymptomatic individuals and see how it compares with that of non-critically symptomatic ones.
