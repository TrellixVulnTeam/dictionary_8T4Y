  <bold>Background and Purpose:</bold> The aim of this study was to characterize neurological complications after flow diverter (FD) treatment on a long follow-up cohort and identify predictive factors associated with these complications.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Methods:</bold> This study was conducted on a monocentric cohort of patients treated for intracranial aneurysms by FD.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Results:</bold> Between September 2008 and July 2018, 413 patients were treated for 514 aneurysms: 18% of the patients presented with at least one neurological complication during a median follow-up of 446 days (IQR 186â€“1,210). Sixty-one patients presented with ischemic complications, 13 with hemorrhagic ones and 10 with compressive processes. Among 89 neurological complications 64.5% were peri-operative (occurring within the 30 days following the procedure) and 35.5% were delayed after 1 month.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Overall, neurological complications after FD implantation were overrepresented by cerebrovascular ischemic events occurring during the peri-operative period, but also in a delayed manner after 1 year. Long-term follow-up is relevant after aneurysm intervention using FD.
