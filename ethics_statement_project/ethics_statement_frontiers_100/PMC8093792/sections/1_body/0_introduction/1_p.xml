<p>Flow-diverter stents (FD) are the latest generation of intracranial stents used to treat intracranial aneurysm, usually those with a wide neck or a fusiform morphology. Several studies reported complications after FD procedure (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), but mainly the most severe ones including disability and death. In fact, severe complications (such as aneurysm rupture and delayed hemorrhagic strokes) related to FD procedures were the source of intense debates in respect to the involved mechanism (

The aim of this study was to characterize neurological complications after FD treatment on a long-follow-up cohort and identify predictive factors associated with these complications.
