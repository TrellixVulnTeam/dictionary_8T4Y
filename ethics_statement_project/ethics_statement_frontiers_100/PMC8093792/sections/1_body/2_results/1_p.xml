<p>Between September 2008 and July 2018, 413 patients with 514 aneurysms were treated. Population characteristics are listed in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Among the 447 procedures, we implanted 265 Pipeline (Medtronic, Dublin), 147 Silk (Balt, Montmorency), 20 FRED (Microvention, Aliso Viejo), 13 Surpass Streamline (Stryker, Kalamazoo), 1 p64 (Phenox, Bochum). One procedure failed and didn't lead to a stent implantation. Patients had a median follow-up of 446 days (IQR 186â€“1,210), with 64% with at least 1 year of follow-up. Eighteen percent of the patients presented with at least one neurological complication. Sixty-one patients presented with ischemic complications, 14 with hemorrhagic complications, 10 with compressive complications. One patient was diagnosed with aura-like spreading cortical depression characterized by progressive onset transitory symptoms, lasting for few minutes up to several hours (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) without any sign of ischemia on MRI. None of the hemorrhagic complication was due to aneurysm rupture after FD placement. Among these 73 patients with complications, 37 had complete or partial hemiparesis, four isolated aphasia or dysarthria, 17 visual loss, seven were early deceased and eight were asymptomatic. Among 61 patients with ischemic complications, 62% (38/61) remain disabled after 24 h.
