<p>Our series reports higher rates of complications in comparison to previous published ones (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In the INTREPED study (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), which focused on AIS after FD implantation, the rate of ischemic events reached 4.5%. The majority (72.2%) of AIS occurred within 30 days, and the fusiform morphology of the aneurysms was the only variable associated with AIS (OR, 2.74; 95% CI: 1.11â€“6.75; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.03). More recently, within a follow-up of 12 months, the prospective DIVERSION observational study (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) reported an event-free survival rate of 75.7%, with a 5.9% rate of permanent-related serious events and 14% of AIS out of 408 FD implantation. In the latter study, hypertension, diabetes and larger aneurysms were associated with neurological deficit occurrence. None of the previous studies reported neurological complications after 12 months. The discrepancy in the observed complication rate with our series, could be explained by a systematic follow-up consult at 6 months, 1, 3, and 5 years follow-up, that could have led to the detection of a higher complication rate. Also we treated 17 basilar artery aneurysms which are known to be associated with higher complications. Association between aneurysms location and neurological complications have been published and is consistent with our results regarding higher risk for MCA (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and posterior circulation (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), possibly in relation to higher rate of perforators in these locations.
