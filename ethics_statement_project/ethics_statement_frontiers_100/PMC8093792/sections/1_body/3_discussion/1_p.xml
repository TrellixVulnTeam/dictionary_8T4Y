<p>In our study, 18% of patients treated with FD presented neurological complications. These complications were mainly ischemic events occurring within the first month (45% occurring after 3 days), but more than 35% occurred later than 1 year. Patients treated for large MCA, posterior circulation aneurysms were at higher risk of neurological complication. In addition, mortality was associated with posterior circulation locations. Despite these complication rates, 92% of the patients were functionally independent (mRS 0â€“2) within a median follow-up of 446 days.</p>
