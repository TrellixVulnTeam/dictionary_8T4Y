<p>Neurological complications were screened at each contact (following the standard of care in the department: 6 months, 1 year and every 2 years and additional visits if needed) and retrospectively reviewed, as well as, adjudicated by two neurologists (GC, MM). Complications were classified in four categories: ischemic, hemorrhagic, compressive and other. Among ischemic ones we identified: Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS), and transient ischemic attack (TIA). Hemorrhagic strokes included: Parenchymal Hematoma (PH), and Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH). Peri-operative complications were defined as events occurring within 30 days after procedure; and delayed complications, when events occurred afterwards. Neurological complications were characterized by a persistent deficit lasting more than 24 h. Retinal ischemia was classified as an AIS if a branch occlusion was seen. TIA were defined as transitory neurological symptoms (&lt;1 h) without any evidence of brain ischemia. Good outcome was defined by a mRS 0â€“2 at last follow up.</p>
