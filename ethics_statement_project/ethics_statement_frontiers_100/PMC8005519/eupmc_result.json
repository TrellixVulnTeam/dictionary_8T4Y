Level of Hb<sub>mass</sub> at age 16 was an important predictor for Hb<sub>mass</sub> and endurance performance at age 19. The aim was to determine how many of these young athletes were still members of Swiss national teams (NT) at age 25, how many already terminated their career (TC), and whether Hb<sub>mass</sub> at ages 16 and 19 was different between the NT and TC group. We measured Hb<sub>mass</sub> using the optimized carbon monoxide re-breathing technique in 10 high-performing endurance athletes every 0.5 years beginning at age 16 and ending at age 19. At age 25, two athletes were in the NT group and eight athletes in the TC group. Mean absolute, body weight-, and lean body mass (LBM) related Hb<sub>mass</sub> at age 16 was 833 \u00b1 61 g, 13.7 \u00b1 0.2 g/kg and 14.2 \u00b1 0.2 g/kg LBM in the NT group and 742 \u00b1 83 g, 12.2 \u00b1 0.7 g/kg and 12.8 \u00b1 0.8 g/kg LBM in the TC group.
