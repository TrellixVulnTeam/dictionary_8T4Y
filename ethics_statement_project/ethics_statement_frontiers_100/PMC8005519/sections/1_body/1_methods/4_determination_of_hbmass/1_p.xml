<p>The method is described in detail in the original paper (Steiner et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In summary, the athletes and controls inhaled a bolus of pure CO (CO-doses were determined to be 1.2 mL·kg
 <sup>−1</sup>). Before inhalation, as well as 6 and 8 min after inhalation, capillary blood samples (35 μL) were taken from the participants' earlobe and analyzed for percent carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) using a diode array spectrophotometer (ABL 800flex, Radiometer A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark). All CO-rebreathing procedures were conducted by the same experienced investigator to avoid inter-tester variability. Our laboratory observed a typical error between 1.1 and 1.4% from duplicate measurements of Hb
 <sub>mass</sub> through the described method (Naef et al.,
