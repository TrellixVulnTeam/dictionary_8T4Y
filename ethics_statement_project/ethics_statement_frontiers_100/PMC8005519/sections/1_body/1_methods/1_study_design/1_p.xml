<p>Six years after the last Hb
 <sub>mass</sub> measurement of the athletes at age 19 (Steiner et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) when the endurance athletes were at age 25, we analyzed which of the 10 cross-country skiers and triathletes were members of the Swiss national team (NT group) and which athletes had terminated their career (TC group). We then retrospectively compared the Hb
 <sub>mass</sub> of both groups at ages 16 and 19.
