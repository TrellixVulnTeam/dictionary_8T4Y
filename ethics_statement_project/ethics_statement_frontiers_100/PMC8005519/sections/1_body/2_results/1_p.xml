<p>At age 25, two athletes were members of the national team (NT group) and eight athletes had terminated their career (TC group). Mean absolute, body weight-, and lean body mass (LBM) related Hb
 <sub>mass</sub> at age 16 were 833 ± 61 g, 13.7 ± 0.2 g/kg and 14.2 ± 0.2 g/kg LBM in the NT group and 742 ± 83 g, 12.2 ± 0.7 g/kg and 12.8 ± 0.8 g/kg LBM in the TC group. At age 19, Hb
 <sub>mass</sub> was 1,042 ± 89 g, 14.6 ± 0.2 g/kg and 15.4 ± 0.2 g/kg LBM in the NT group and 863 ± 109 g, 12.7 ± 1.1 g/kg and 13.5 ± 1.1 in the TC group. Body weight- and lean body mass related Hb
 <sub>mass</sub> were higher in the NT group than in the TC group at both ages 16 and 19 (
