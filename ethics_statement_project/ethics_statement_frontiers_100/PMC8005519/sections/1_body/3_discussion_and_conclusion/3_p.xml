<p>However, it is important to note that a high body weight related Hb
 <sub>mass</sub> is not the only factor related to national team membership at an adult age. While the level of body weight related Hb
 <sub>mass</sub> seems to be likely a prerequisite, it is not a guarantee for later national team membership. Other important factors like a high VO
 <sub>2max</sub> (and every aspect of oxygen transport), the ability to utilize a high fraction of VO
 <sub>2max</sub>, a high energy availability, a high anaerobic power, a high efficiency, a high speed capacity and strength in connection with movement specific exercise, play an important role as well (Sandbakk and Holmberg, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). It also needs to be emphasized, that this short report suffer from several limitations: The first point is, that we have a very low n (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2) in the NT group. Results could therefore have been biased by false positive or negative results and other confounding factors. It is also important to mention, that there could be potential differences in the physiological demands between triathlon and cross-country skiers athletes. However, our longitudinal study (Steiner et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) suggested, that Hb
 <sub>mass</sub> at age 16 is an important predictor for Hb
 <sub>mass</sub> at age 19. With this additional analysis of national team membership at age 25, we now can further suggest, that a high Hb
 <sub>mass</sub> (13.5–14 g/kg) at age 16 could be an important prerequisite for future national team membership at age 28 in endurance disciplines. However, further multi–centric longitudinal studies (merging data from different national training centers) would provide larger sample size for such interesting retrospective talent identification analysis/modeling.
