<p>The main finding of this brief research report is that the mean body weight related Hb
 <sub>mass</sub> in the NT group at age 16 was remarkably 1.5 g/kg higher than that in the TC group (1.9 g/kg higher at age 19; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, body weight related Hb
 <sub>mass</sub> values of the NT group reached 13.7 g/kg at age 16 and 14.6 g/kg at age 19. These measurements were very similar to those observed in previous investigations with juniors at age 19 (14.2 g/kg) and national team athletes at age 28 (14.6 g/kg) cross-country skiers and triathletes (Steiner and Wehrlin, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Even though, on average, body weight-related Hb
 <sub>mass</sub> increased by ~0.3 g/kg per year between ages 16 and 19, for future elite national team athletes, Hb
 <sub>mass</sub> levels of 13.5â€“14 g/kg at age 16 seem to be a prerequisite to transition to national team at age 25.
