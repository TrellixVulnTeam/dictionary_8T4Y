<p>We think that a Hb
 <sub>mass</sub> level of 14–15 g/kg at age 28 is needed to be a member of a national team in endurance disciplines (Steiner and Wehrlin, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). This finding is supported by the fact that Hb
 <sub>mass</sub> values from other countries elite male cross-country skiing and triathlon national teams, as well as athletes from other endurance sports, are reported to be about 14–15 g/kg (Heinicke et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Wehrlin and Marti, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Gore et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Zelenkova et al., 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2019a</xref>). Mean body weight related Hb
 <sub>mass</sub> at age 16 was lower in the NT and TC compared to the Hb
 <sub>mass</sub> at ages 19 and 28 (Steiner et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), which seems to be due to the fact that only two to three athletes per year have the potential to make it to the national team in cross-country skiing and triathlon. Whereas the athletes at ages 19 and 28 (Steiner et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) consisted of several age cohorts, our athletes at age 16 (NT and TC) consisted of only a 1 year cohort. This means that this group was comprised of physiologically less-talented athletes, which lowered the mean body weight related Hb
 <sub>mass</sub>.
