<p>The linear regression equation in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> points to CoronaSurveys very consistently underestimating the number of cases by a factor of ~46%, possibly due to asymptomatic cases. This ratio is consistent with the estimates of the Covid19Impact study of Oliver et al. (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), which used more than 140, 000 direct survey responses collected on March 28th–30th. It is also consistent with the reported data on asymptomatic cases reported by Pollán et al. (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), which found that around a third of the seropositive participants were asymptomatic (see 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).
