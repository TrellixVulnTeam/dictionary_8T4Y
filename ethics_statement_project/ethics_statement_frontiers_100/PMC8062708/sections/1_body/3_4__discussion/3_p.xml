<p>Our study presents a number of limitations. Firstly, as presented in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, our number of responses in some regions was limited (e.g., nine responses in La Rioja or 16 in Navarra and Cantabria). Our own analysis suggests this is not enough to offer reliable data for these three regions. Additionally, our criteria to eliminate outliers is heuristic, and may change in the future as we collect more data.
