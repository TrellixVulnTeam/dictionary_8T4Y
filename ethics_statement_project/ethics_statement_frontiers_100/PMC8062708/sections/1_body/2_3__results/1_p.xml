<p>To assess the accuracy of this method in estimating the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19, we compare our cross-sectional survey estimates with the results of the serology study of Pollán et al. (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) for Spain. We exclude Ceuta and Melilla due to lack of data on our part. Conducted between April 27 and May 11, 2020, the serology study provides data for 
 <italic>n</italic> = 61, 075 participants (0.1787 ± 0.0984% of the regional population, and 0.1299% of the national population). We consider as positive cases those that tested positive to the point-of-care or immunoassay IgG tests [Supplementary Table 6 in Pollán et al. (
