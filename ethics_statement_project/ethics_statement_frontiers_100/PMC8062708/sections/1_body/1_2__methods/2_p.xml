<p>In the CoronaSurveys project we have focused on simplicity and brevity to maximize interest and retain users that would consistently provide data every few days. For that reason the total number of questions in the survey has been kept small at all times. Our approach yielded good initial results with about 200 responses per week. The survey has been promoted via social networks, direct contacts, and, more recently, with paid advertising.</p>
