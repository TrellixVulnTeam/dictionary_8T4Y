<p>From 2016 to 2019, 61 out of 183 patients with spinal infection underwent cerebral imaging for detection of any pathologies within the brain. The mean age in this cohort was 68.7 years. The cohort consisted of 44 males and 17 females. Among all patients undergoing cerebral imaging, two (3.3%) revealed a coexisting brain infection. Cerebritis with intraventricular empyema in one case and three brain abscesses in the other case were noted. The maximum diameter of the largest abscess was 2 × 3.5 cm, the remaining two were smaller (1 × 1.5 cm and 1 × 1.2 cm). Both patients were admitted in a severe septic condition, were treated in the ICU, and died due to multi-organ failure. The most likely etiology of the spinal and cerebral infection was sepsis. Detection of the pathogen was feasible in 42 (69%). Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent infectious agent and was detected in 31 patients (74%), followed by Streptococcus in 6 (14%), Propionibacterium acnes and
