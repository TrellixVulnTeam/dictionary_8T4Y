<p>In view of the data we have collected, the expected detection rate of brain infection in patients with spinal infection increases with the following predictive factors: spinal epidural abscess (
 <italic>n</italic> = 32; 6.25%), positive blood culture (
 <italic>n</italic> = 29; 6.9%), and a septic condition upon admission (
 <italic>n</italic> = 12; 16.7%).
