<p>The prevalence of sepsis in our investigated series was the strongest predictive criterion that we found potentially associated with the incidence of brain infection. Furthermore, it seems that the mortality rate is increased when cerebral and spinal infections are harbored. Since an altered mental state is another common feature of sepsis and even severe pneumonia, it is not common to order brain MRIs in all cases. Here, we focus on this aspect and recommend brain imaging in patients with sepsis and altered mental status.</p>
