<p>Spinal infections are a growing problem that deserves our multidisciplinary attention from cardiologists, radiologists, microbiologists, infectiologists, and spinal surgeons. The spinal infection mostly represents a sign of a systemic infection, proven by bacteremia, a septic condition, fever, or neurologic deficit, which then manifest themselves as spinal and even cerebral infections (

Nonetheless, focusing on the best treatment of the spinal infection and neglecting coexisting or secondary brain infections may result in poor patient outcomes despite enormous efforts. Therefore, it is mandatory to establish multidisciplinary diagnostic and treatment algorithms for patients with spinal infections. One aspect that has not been highlighted is the incidence of brain infection.
