<p>Within this study, we have investigated the incidence of secondary brain infection among patients with pyogenic spondylodiscitis. Of 61 patients with pyogenic spinal infection, 2 patients had signs of cerebral infection by imaging, both of whom were in coma (GCS 3) and in sepsis, which would have prompted cerebral imaging. It should be noted that cerebral imaging would also be ordered in all patients with reduced consciousness, not just those with a pyogenic spinal infection. To the best of our knowledge, the routine diagnosis of brain infection in the management of patients with pyogenic spondylodiscitis has not been described until now.</p>
