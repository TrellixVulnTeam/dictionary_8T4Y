<p>CNS infections, such as brain abscesses, epidural abscess, meningitis, and septic embolic stroke are often attributed to hematogenous spread, contiguous spread, recent neurosurgical procedures, or penetrating head trauma (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Endocarditis or pulmonary infections are the most common sources of hematogenous spread and are often associated, as coexisting infections, with pyogenic spinal infections (

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In many cases, the origin of the spinal infections might be a systemic infection, which causes sepsis, endocarditis, spinal infection, and brain infection. Nevertheless, all patients with spinal infections were initially introduced to our department for the treatment of spinal infections. Here, we want to highlight and postulate the need and advantage of a multidisciplinary approach, which results in a higher detection rate of coexisting infections and complications. Patients with severe sepsis and an altered mental state at our ICU revealed, besides the spinal infection, brain infection detected by routine cerebral imaging. Therefore, we recommend routine brain MRI especially in patients with signs of systemic infection, such as bacteremia, sepsis, or endocarditis and an altered mental state.
