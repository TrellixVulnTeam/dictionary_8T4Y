<p>The incidence of spondylodiscitis in western countries has been rising over recent decades. The main reasons are demographic changes, extended life expectancy, and improved access to medical services and treatment of chronic diseases (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Moreover, the median age of patients suffering from spondylodiscitis is increasing, and a high number of these patients harbor a significant number of comorbidities (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The incidence of coexisting brain infections in these patients is still unclear. Until now there is a significant lack of scientific data reporting on this issue. Brain infections are relatively rare, but they are potentially serious and have a poor prognosis with reported overall mortality rates in patients hospitalized with central nervous system infections up to 32% (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment of brain infection are important for a patient's outcome. The aim of the present study is to highlight the incidence of secondary brain infection, risk factors, and clinical outcomes in patients with pyogenic spondylodiscitis admitted to a university spine surgery unit. We further evaluate the value of cerebral imaging in the management of these patients.
