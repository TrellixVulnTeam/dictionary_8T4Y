<p>In the absence of the real time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (real time RT–PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 and the Immunoglobulin G (Ig G) virus-specific antibody detection for COVID-19, the certainty in diagnosis is obviously unattainable. However, the low level of accuracy of such tests that was feared in the early phase of the pandemic and the uncertainties about how long people who recovered would have had immunity dissuaded us from contacting the patient for confirmation tests. Furthermore, even if the serological tests were positive, it could not have been excluded that the patient had contracted the infection later without developing significant symptoms.</p>
