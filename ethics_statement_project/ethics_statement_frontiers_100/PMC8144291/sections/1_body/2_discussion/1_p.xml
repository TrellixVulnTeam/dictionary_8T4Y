<p>Herein, we presented a case of severe post-partum pneumonia before the COVID-19 Italian pandemic outbreak. The responsible agent was considered 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>. However, the evidence that subsequently emerged about the clinical and imaging features of women affected by COVID-19 suggested to reassess the case. After a multidisciplinary consultation, we concluded that the most likely hypothesis was that the patient was affected by novel Coronavirus pneumonia. Co-infection with 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> probably inhibited the host immune system making the recovery process particularly prolonged.
