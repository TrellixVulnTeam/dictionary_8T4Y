<p>On the other hand, some clinical features that might question our interpretation must be disclosed. First of all, the observed lung insemination and bilateral pleurisy in the presence of clinical signs of fever, cough, and dyspnea could suggest a bacterial etiology. The hematogenous dissemination of 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> supports this hypothesis. However, also a nosocomial gram negative bacterium infection cannot be excluded. Second, in COVID-19 infection, bilateral pleurisy is rare and ground grass infiltrates are predominantly sub-pleural. Finally, ceftazidime resistance could also appear for 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and metronidazole would have not affected gram-negative bacteria.
