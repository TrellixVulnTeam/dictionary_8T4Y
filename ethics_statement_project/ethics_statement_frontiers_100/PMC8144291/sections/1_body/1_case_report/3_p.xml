<p>She was otherwise healthy and was a non-smoker taking no medications. After the admission, the patient was hydrated. Nevertheless, the ultrasound reevaluation confirmed oligohydramnios and the labor was induced with intravaginal prostaglandin E2.

The umbilical cord blood parameters were reassuring and didn't reflect a fetal hypoxic stress. Cesarean section was exempt from surgical complications.
