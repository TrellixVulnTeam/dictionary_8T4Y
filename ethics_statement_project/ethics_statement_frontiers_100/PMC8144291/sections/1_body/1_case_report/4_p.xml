<p>Twenty hours after the c-section, mild dyspnea on exertion developed, associated with slight leg edema. On examination, the blood pressure was 135/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air; the temperature was 37.6°C. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at 118 beats per minute. Blood levels of total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, calcium, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase were normal, as were tests of renal function; other test results are shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. She was given broad spectrum antibiotics and strictly monitored. The day after (50 h after the c-section) dyspnea progressively worsened and a productive cough appeared. Body temperature was 38.2°C, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Lung auscultation revealed bi-basal rhonchi and vescicular sounds bibasaly reduced. After a consultation with a pulmonologist, pulmonary computed-tomographic (CT) was planned and showed bilateral confluent and patchy ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities, small, bilateral pleural effusions and no evidence of pulmonary embolism, aortic aneurysm, or pericardial effusion (

 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> bacteremia. An infectious disease specialist consultation was required and a targeted antibiotic therapy with Metronidazole and Ceftadizime was started. After 4 days, the clinical picture showed no significant improvements. A new pulmonary CT was performed and confirmed the absence of benefits of the current treatment. The infectious disease specialist therefore decided to add the administration of Meropenem to the ongoing antibiotic therapy.
