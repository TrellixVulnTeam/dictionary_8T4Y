<p>Available epidemiological models failed to justify such a rapid growth in the number of infections. Still undemonstrated theories sustain that the new Coronavirus may have circulated in northern Italy for weeks before it was detected, seriously complicating efforts to track and control its rapid spread across Europe.

The real beginnings of the outbreak, which has spread from Italy across Europe, were probably seeded at least two or 3 weeks before the first detection and possibly before flights between Italy and China were suspended at the end of January.</p>
