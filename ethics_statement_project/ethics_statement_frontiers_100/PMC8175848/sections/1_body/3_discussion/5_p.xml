<p>For flexible children flatfeet with accessory navicular bone, we did not perform any other extra procedure. After the deformity is corrected, the alignment is restored, and the stress at the posterior tibial tendon stop and accessory navicular bone will be significantly reduced, which is conducive to the disappearance of inflammatory reactions. Also, for children patients, the accessory navicular bone still can fuse with the navicular bone. Therefore, we did not address the accessory navicular bone in 12 cases, and there were no apparent symptoms after surgery.</p>
