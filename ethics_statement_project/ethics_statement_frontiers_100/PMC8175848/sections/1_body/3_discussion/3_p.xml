<p>In patients with triceps contracture, the traction force increases, and heel stress decreases when walking. Furthermore, the stress transmitted forward through the ankle joint increases, leading to the medial longitudinal arch and metatarsal head stress increase. Therefore, the triceps does not affect on the maintenance of the arch, but its contracture is an essential cause for the arch collapse. Some scholars have found that the tension of the Achilles tendon increases after the implantation through biomechanical studies, and pointed out that the tendency of a cavus foot will be more visible even there is no cavus foot before surgery (
