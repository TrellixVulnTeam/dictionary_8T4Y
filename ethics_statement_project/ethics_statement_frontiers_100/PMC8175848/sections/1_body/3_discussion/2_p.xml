<p>The choice of the implant size is very crucial. The principle is the minimum size that can correct the deformity and can be stably maintained in the tarsal sinus when activity. The implant should maintain the calcaneus at 2~4Â° eversion position, which can be determined by the AP, lateral, oblique, and calcaneal axial X-ray. The tail of the implant should be consistent with the lateral edge of the talus on the AP X-ray, and its head should not exceed the midline of the talus neck. There are no specific normative standards for the Talar-Fit implant of Meditec and we think this study can be used as a reference. It remains controversial whether the fatty tissue in the tarsal sinus needs to be removed before implantation. Some surgeons believe that it is necessary to remove the fatty tissues richly supplied with nerve endings to avoid the pain caused by implant simulation (

They believe that the thread-like structure of the implant can be inosculated with the soft tissue to maintain stability. The firmness may be affected if the soft tissue is removed, and the implant directly contacts the hard bone (
