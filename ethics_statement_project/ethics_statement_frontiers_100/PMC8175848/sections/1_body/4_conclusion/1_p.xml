<p>In short, the treatment principle of flexible children flatfeet is to correct deformities and restore the alignment. The subtalar joint arthroereisis has the advantages of simple, minimally invasive, and rapid recovery. It effectively corrects deformities, restores the alignment, and reconstruct the functions of the soft tissue without joint fusion. This technology has a promising application prospect with the development and improvement of the subtalar joint implant. However, subtalar joint arthroereisis cannot be applied blindly, and surgical indications and contraindications should be kept in mind. More importantly, for some severe forefoot abduction cases, when the correction of the subtalar joint arthroereisis is not satisfactory, it is necessary to combine the release of the Achilles tendon or gastrocnemius muscle release, the spring ligament and deltoid ligament this technology has a better application prospect. Individualized surgery can better correct the deformity, restore the alignment, achieving more commendable clinical results.</p>
