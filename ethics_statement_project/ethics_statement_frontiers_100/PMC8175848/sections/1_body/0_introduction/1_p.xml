<p>Children flatfoot is common in clinics, most of which are flexible. Its etiology and pathological process are unclear (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Most pediatric orthopedic surgeons believe that radiographic measurements such as Meary's angle, talonavicular coverage, the lateral talocalcaneal angle and the kite's angle, and the clinical assessments of foot, especially the forefoot, including foot flexibility, the quality and amount of forefoot pronation, triceps surae contracture, longitudinal arch and the valgus of the hindfoot, are very important for diagnosis (

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). There are various treatments, including conservative and surgical methods. Conservative therapies include arch pads, orthopedic shoes, and braces (

Although osteotomies can correct the forefoot abduction, they are challenging to operate and increase the probability of complications such as fracture malunion, delayed union or non-union, epiphyseal injuries, etc. (
