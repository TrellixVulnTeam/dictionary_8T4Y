<p>Calcaneo-stop procedure was reported by Alvarez in 1995, which used a extra-articular screw to achieve arthroereisis, but it could make joint stiffness. In recent years, with the improving understanding of flexible flat feet and the development of the subtalar joint arthroereisis, which can allow a certain range of motion. It is gradually accepted by orthopedic surgeons. Although sinus tarsi pain were reported as the most frequent complication of subtalar arthroereisis, this procedure can effectively correct the calcaneal valgus and raise the talar head without damaging the bones and has been reported as a minimally-invasive, effective and low-risk procedure in the treatment of flatfoot mainly in children but also in adults (
