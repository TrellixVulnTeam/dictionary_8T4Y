<p>Thirty patients(32 feet) were followed up for 18–36 months, with an average of 25.3 months. All of the 30 children underwent conservative treatment using the insole before undergoing surgery. All feet in this study were performed the tightening procedure, 24 feet underwent gastrocnemius release and four feet underwent gastrocnemius release. All operations were performed by one chief surgeon of foot and ankle surgery, and his assistants were attending surgeons. All incisions healed in the first stage without infection. The implant position was lost in one case due to excessive activities and sprain 3 months after surgery. Reoperation implantation of the subtalar joint arthroereisis was performed. During the follow-up, no complications such as loosening of the implant and recurrence of flat foot deformity occurred in other cases. The pain was significantly relieved, and arch collapse was significantly improved (
