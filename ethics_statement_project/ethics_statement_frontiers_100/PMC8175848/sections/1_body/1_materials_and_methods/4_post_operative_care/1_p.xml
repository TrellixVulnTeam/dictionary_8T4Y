<p>Patients underwent Achilles tendon lengthening and medial soft tissue tightening require plaster fixation for 4 weeks. Plaster fixation is not required for patients without soft tissue surgery or gastrocnemius release. They wear walking braces at night and perform passive plantar and dorsal flexion exercises on the first day after surgery. The active flexion exercise of the ankle was performed on the second day after surgery. The suture was removed 12â€“14 days after the operation. Non-weight-bearing exercises, including swimming and bicycling, were usually recommended 3 weeks after surgery. The partial weight-bearing functional exercise was started 6 weeks after surgery. Immediately, 6-week and 12-week post-operative AP, lateral, and oblique radiographs were performed. The X-ray was taken every 3 months after 12 weeks to observe the correction of the deformity and the position of the implant (
