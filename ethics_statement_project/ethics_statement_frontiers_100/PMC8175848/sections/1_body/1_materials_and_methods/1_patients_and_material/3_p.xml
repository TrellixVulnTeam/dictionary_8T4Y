<p>The Talar-Fit implant of Meditec used in this study has anatomy that completely mimics the tarsal sinus, which can avoid discomfort and pain caused by activity. Its blunt threads can reduce the incidence of soft tissue irritation and synovitis. Furthermore, deep threads can promote soft-tissue growth and achieve further stability. Last but not least, the procedure is simple, and it is not necessary to cut the interosseous ligament, which is more conducive to the stability of the subtalar joint.</p>
