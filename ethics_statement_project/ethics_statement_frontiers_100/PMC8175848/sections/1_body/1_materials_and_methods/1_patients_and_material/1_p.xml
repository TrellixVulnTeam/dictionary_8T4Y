<p>Thirty children with flexible flat feet (32 feet) were included in this study. There were 18 males (20 feet) and 12 females (12 feet) with an average age of 9.5 years (range, 8â€“12 years). All the patients had a medial longitudinal arch collapse, pain, hindfoot eversion, walking difficulties and prominent forefoot abduction. The weight-bearing AP and lateral X-ray, arch height, Meary angle, and talo-first metatarsal angle were measured pre-operatively. The foot function was evaluated pre-operatively with American Ankle and Surgery Association (AOFAS) ankle and hindfoot scoring and VAS score. The Silverskold test was used to evaluate the gastrocnemius or Achilles tendon contracture. The testing method was to maintain the posterior foot in a neutral position and the knee to be fully straightened. Improved ankle dorsiflexion with knee flexed suggesting the presence of the gastrocnemius contracture; equivalent ankle dorsiflexion with knee flexion and extension suggesting the presence of the Achilles contracture. All 32 feet had severe forefoot abduction with gastrocnemius or Achilles tendon contracture.</p>
