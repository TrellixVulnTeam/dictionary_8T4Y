<p>Interestingly, Ye et al. showed that statin intake may reduce the risk of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), statins may induce myositis in rare situations, and inflammation is one of the cancer-causing factors (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In addition to our report, we noticed another reported case diagnosed with both statin-induced myopathy and extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). As we know, inflammation is one of the cancer-causing factor, in this case, the persistent focal myositis, possibly caused by statins/ezetimibe, may play a role in the oncogenesis of primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma.
