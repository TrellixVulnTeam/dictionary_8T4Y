So, the patient underwent to a lower left lobectomy surgery and a typical lingulectomy in anterolateral thoracotomy. Given the increase in inflammation indices and the progressive increase in opacity of the residual left lung parenchyma due to infarction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), the patient was submitted to a left pneumonectomy. The hospital stay lasted 10 days and the patient was discharged in good clinical conditions. The final histopathological diagnosis was a 7,5-cm lung Adenocarcinoma; the bronchial surgical margin was negative and visceral pleural invasion was not observed. Of the 12 dissected lymph nodes, all were reported as negative and the pathological stage was reported as IIIA (T4N0M0).
