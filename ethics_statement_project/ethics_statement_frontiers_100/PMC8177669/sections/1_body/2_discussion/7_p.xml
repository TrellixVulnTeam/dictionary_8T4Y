<p>The heparin dosage for patients undergoing oncological thoracic surgery is established according to the Caprini score. This score is based on several factors including age, weight, a history of thromboembolism, prolonged immobilization. According to the Caprini Score, our oncological patients, who are undergoing surgery, receive low molecular weight subcutaneous heparin at a dosage of 0.3 ml, 2,850 Ul the night before surgery until 2 days after. From the third postoperative day, the dosage is increased to 0.4 ml, 3,800 Ul or 0.6 ml, 5,700 Ul for up to 25 days after surgery or until complete mobilization.</p>
