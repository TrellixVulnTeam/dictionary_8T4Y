<p>A radical mastectomy and metastatic intercostal lymph node dissection was performed as imaging revealed intercostal lymph node metastasis. The presence of intercostal lymph node metastasis is out of the range of the main groups of breast lymphatic drainage. Imaging evaluation of the lymph node metastasis of breast cancer should include intercostal lymph nodes in addition to the axillary, internal mammary, and supraclavicular lymph nodes. Limited research on this metastasis and danger to surrounding tissues complicates many traditional treatment approaches. The application of 3D visualization might be useful for preoperative evaluation, surgical planning, and 3D implants in the future.</p>
