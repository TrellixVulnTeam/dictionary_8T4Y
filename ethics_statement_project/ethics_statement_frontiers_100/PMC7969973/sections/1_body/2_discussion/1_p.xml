<p>The axillary lymph nodes are the primary group responsible for breast lymphatic drainage and, consequently, are the most common location for metastasis (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, lymphatic pathways running from the breast via intercostal spaces to parasternal lymph vessels were found separate from typical metastatic sites (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer eighth edition manual, regional lymph node metastasis includes the ipsilateral axillary lymph node, supraclavicular, subclavicular, and internal mammary lymph node; the presence of intercostal metastasis is out of the range of these regional lymph nodes (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Intercostal lymph node metastasis may negatively affect the prognosis of the primary breast cancer patient, exacerbating breast cancer progression. Her final stage was IIIA (pT1cN2bM0), which was based on our clinical experience and the American Joint Committee on Cancer eighth edition manual (
