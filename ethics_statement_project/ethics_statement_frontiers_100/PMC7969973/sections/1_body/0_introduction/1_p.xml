<p>The predominant lymphatic drainage pathway drains from the breast toward the axilla (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). However, nodal metastases outside the axilla may be present in up to 56% of breast cancer patients (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The sites of extra-axillary nodes include the internal mammary lymph nodes, the infraclavicular region, the supraclavicular fossa, the interpectoral (Rotter's) space, and the breast itself. Intercostal lymph node metastasis of breast cancer is an extremely rare extra-axillary site, a drainage pathway largely absent in literature. Although this drainage may be uncommon, it often escalates the severity of breast cancer and necessitates alternative treatment options.
