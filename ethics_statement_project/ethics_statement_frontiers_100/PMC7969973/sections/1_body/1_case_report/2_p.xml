<p>An irregular hypoechoic mass, with a long diameter of 2 cm, was seen at the 6 o'clock position in the right breast on ultrasonography, which was highly suspicious for malignancy (BI-RADS category 4c). The preoperative MRI showed a spiculated mass in the right breast and an oval nodule in the right fourth intercostal region. A washout pattern on dynamic-enhanced sequence and restriction of diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging were demonstrated both in the breast mass and the intercostal lymph node. The breast mass indicated malignancy (BI-RADS category 5), while the nodule in the right fourth intercostal rib was highly suspected to metastasize (
