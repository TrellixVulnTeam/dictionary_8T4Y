<p>Our study has some limitations. Although, there was no positive biomarkers in serum that could make sure of mature teratoma specifically, we failed to detect the relevant markers in patient's CSF, which may have missed some meaningful results. However, the gold standard still depends on the postoperative pathological findings. Furthermore, his parents had been delayed for many years to decide the operation, and the symptoms developed to a more serious situation, otherwise he may got a better outcome. Currently, this study was a retrospective study performed in a single case, and the follow-up duration was not long enough for benign tumors. As well as the extremely low incidence of this disease, there was ineluctable statistical deviation in the literature review. It is necessary to conduct related cases in the future for further summary.</p>
