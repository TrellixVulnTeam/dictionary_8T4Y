<p>The World Health Organization has classified teratoma into the following groups (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>): mature teratoma, immature teratoma, and teratoma with malignant transformation. Some researchers have found that biomarkers like β-HCG and AFP can be used for distinguishing mature teratomas with immature or malignant components (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). These marker proteins are sometimes secreted by immature teratomas or embryonal carcinomas that mature teratomas usually present negatively. While other immunohistochemical markers like PLAP and c-kit were not particularly helpful in obtaining a differential diagnosis of histological subtypes (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Masao et al. determined the serum titers of AFP and β-HCG in 7 patients with intracranial mature teratomas and found that none of them had elevated titers, which was consistent with us (
