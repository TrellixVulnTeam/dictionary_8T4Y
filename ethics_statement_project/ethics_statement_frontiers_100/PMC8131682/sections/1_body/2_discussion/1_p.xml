<p>Intracranial teratomas are comprised of mature cells that originate from three embryonic layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. During the 3rd to 4th week of embryonic development, neural tube closes and these tissue implantation leads to cyst formation. Some misplaced cells of the embryonic disc, may be involved in this movement and migrate with the moving cells of the mesoderm, especially the lateral mesoderm, to the future cranial area (

Our case was pathologically proved to be a mature teratoma because of containing well-differentiated components from mesoderm (bone and fatty tissue) and ectoderm (squamous epithelia). Occasionally, they could develop from a single germ layer if they showed histologically divergent differentiation. Ijiri et al. described a case of spinal mature teratoma, whose components were from only the mesoderm layer (
