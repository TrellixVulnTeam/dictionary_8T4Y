<p>As midline lesions, these tumors usually occupy the pineal and suprasellar region (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Rarely, they have been described in the fourth ventricle (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Other non-midline sites that have been reported are lateral ventricles, basal ganglia, cerebellopontine angle, and cavernous sinus (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Given variations in size and location of tumors, preoperative signs and symptoms are different from each other (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Previous cases show that gait disturbance is the most common symptom (3 of 5), followed by headache (1 of 5) and paroxysmal vomiting (1 of 5), which may have been a symptom of intermittent raised intracranial pressure. MRI imaging often displays heterogeneous mass with cystic components on T1 and T2 weighted images dependent on the contents within tumors (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). CT scan can sensitively demonstrate regions of calcification in most teratomas (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).
