<p>Teratoma in the medulla oblongata is extremely infrequent. According to our extensive literature review, only four cases of primary teratoma in medulla oblongata had been reported so far (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Combined with our novel case, a total of five patients diagnosed with teratoma in the medulla oblongata were all male in Eastern Asia. Eighty percent (4 of 5) of them were children at the initiation of treatment aged in the range of 9–15 years old (mean 12 years), except a 39 year-old adult diagnosed with malignant teratoma reported by Tsuzuki et al. (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Sixty percent of patients (3 of 5) have got the gross total resection, and the others underwent chemo-radio-therapy after subtotal resection. Based on the particularly high risk of neurosurgical removal, follow up of these five cases has shown poor prognosis. Unfortunately, 2 of them died 3 months after treatment, because of the intracranial infection or tumor regrowth.
