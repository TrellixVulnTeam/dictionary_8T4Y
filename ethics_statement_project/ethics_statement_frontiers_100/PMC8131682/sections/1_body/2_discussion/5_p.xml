<p>Until now, the aim of treatment always be radical resection of tumors, and postoperative adjuvant treatment for intracranial teratomas has remained controversial. Lee et al. and Bi et al. both hold the opinion that mature teratomas may be resistant to chemoradiation and could eventually grow during adjuvant therapy (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). As a result, a second-look surgery would be effective for treatment of teratomas resistant to adjuvant therapy. In this case, the patient achieved gross total resection, and pathological findings indicated to be mature teratoma. We followed up closely after the operation, so far, no evidence of tumor recurrence has been found. However, the recurrence rate of immature teratomas and teratomas with malignant transformation is higher than that of mature teratomas (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Chemoradiotherapy for immature teratomas appears to have good results, such as PE, PVB, ICE, and NGGCT regimen (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). According to some reports, combinations of high-dose radiation therapy (44â€“60 Gy) and chemotherapy seem to be effective for malignant teratomas (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Therefore, for those tumors which show immature or malignant component, postoperative adjuvant treatment should be reserved.
