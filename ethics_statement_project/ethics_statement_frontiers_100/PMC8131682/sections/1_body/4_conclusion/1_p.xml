<p>This study retrospected an extremely rare case of mature teratoma in the medulla oblongata. Bsed on our experience, early surgical resection with the capsule maintained intact is a preferable option before irreversible neurological dysfunction occurs. The surgeon needs to maintain the balance between the degree of tumor resection and the preservation of neurological function. Also, a long-term follow-up and further summary of related cases in the future is required to obtain a definite prognosis. Finally, further studies focusing on biological characteristics are needed, which can help the management of this tumor in the medulla oblongata.</p>
