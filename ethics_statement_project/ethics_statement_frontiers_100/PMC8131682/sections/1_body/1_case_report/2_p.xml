<p>The patient underwent a craniotomy via a midline sub-occipital approach in prone position. A vertical skin incision was made from the external occipital protuberance to the C2 spinous process. The foramen magnum was opened and then C1-2 laminectomy was performed. Intraoperatively, a slightly swollen medulla oblongata was exposed. An ossified crust surrounded by soft material and partial calcified portion were visible. We carefully isolated the tumor border from the brain stem and performed a complete removal of the intramedullary lesion. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any neurological deterioration.</p>
