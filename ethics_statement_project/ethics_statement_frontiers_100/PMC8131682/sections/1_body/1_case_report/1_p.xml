<p>A 15 year-old boy was admitted to our hospital with a 13 year history of progressive gait disturbance and weakness of limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in 2008 showed a mass lesion with mixed signal compressing the medulla oblongata (the primary image was lost because of floods that year). However, his parents refused surgery due to high risks of neurological impairment and chose the palliative treatment of achilles tendon lengthening instead. Symptoms were slightly alleviated in the following years. One year ago, the patient received a Computed Tomography (CT) scan revealing a predominantly calcified lesion in the same area of the medulla oblongata. Subsequently, MRI examination (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) indicated a markedly large mass from the medulla oblongata to C1 spine with a size of 3.1 cm. A high signal intensity rims around a low signal intensity core on T1-weighted and a low signal intensity rims around a high signal intensity core on T2-weighted images. A heterogeneous enhanced lesion was displayed on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) excluded the possibility of vascular malformation. No other lesions were seen in CNS. Neurological examination revealed bilateral 4/5 strength of lower limbs and increased muscle tension with normal deep tendon reflexes in both upper and lower limbers. Babinski sign was positive bilaterally, but deep and superficial sensations were normal. Preoperative biomarkers in serum including Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP, 1.02 ug/L) and beta subunit human chorionic gonadotropin (Î²-HCG, 0.1 U/L) appeared in low levels.
