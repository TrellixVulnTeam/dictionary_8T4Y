<p>At present, there is no special treatment method for APD. Common treatment methods are to treat the primary disease to eliminate inducement. In this report, all patients were treated with oral antihistamines, topical glucocorticoid, and retinoic acid ointment combined with NB-UVB irradiation, and the efficacy was satisfactory. In conclusion, we found there are four common dermoscopic features of APD including a yellow-brown homogeneous structureless area in the center of the lesion, dotted and linear vessel distribution radially, and a dam shape uplift at the periphery, as well as a white irregular ring surrounding the lesion. There are three features, including the yellow-brown homogeneous structureless area in the center of the lesion, the dotted and linear vessel distribution radially, and a white irregular ring surrounding the lesion, which corresponds with the findings of Emma Ormerod et al. (

In our report, we found a new dermoscopic feature: the dam shape uplift at the periphery. These findings could improve the rate of clinical diagnosis of APD.
