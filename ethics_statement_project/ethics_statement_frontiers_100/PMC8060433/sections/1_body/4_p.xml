<p>Dermatoscopic images reveal that the first four clear and consistent features corresponded to the histopathology changes of APD. The yellow-brown homogeneous structureless area in the center of the lesion was found to correspond to the collagen bundle that penetrates the epidermis vertically. The dotted and linear vessel distribution radially in the lesion was found to correspond to the perivascular inflammatory cells. The dam shape uplift at the periphery was found to correspond to the thickening of stratum spinosum and the form of cup-shaped depression of the epidermis by extruded collagen. This white irregular ring surrounding the lesion indicates pigment loss. The first three features also corresponded to a report of Emma Ormerod et al. (
