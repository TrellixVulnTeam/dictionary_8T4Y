<p>Acquired perforating dermatosis (APD) is a penetrating skin disease characterized by the excretion of denatured collagen from the epidermis. The most common clinical symptom of APD is pruritus. The lesions are distributed widely and characterized by umbilicated papules and plaques with central crusted ulceration (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). MASSON's trichrome and elastic fiber stain showed collagen fibers penetrating the epidermis in the dermis. APD is a rare disorder and the clinical presentation can vary from patient to patient, and it is difficult to differentiate clinically from prurigo nodularis, solar dermatitis, or other diseases. The real diagnosis is often missed or delayed.
