<p>According to our understanding, the kind of penetrating dermatosis, such as penetrating folliculitis, Kyrle disease, and elastosis perforans, have common features under the pathology, including parakeratosis keratotic plug or elastic fiber through the epidermis. We also summarized the differences in dermoscopic features between prurigo and APD. The dermoscopic features of prurigo show pale brown solitary raised papules with sticky white scabs, irregular white unstructured areas, and spotty, linear vascular foci. Different from the dermoscopic features of APD, there is no yellow-brown homogeneous structureless area in the center, no dam shape uplift at the periphery of the lesion, a white irregular halo surrounding the lesion, and the vascular arrangement is irregular. Therefore, hypothesize that the four dermoscopic features of APD described above are common dermoscopic features of penetrating collagen disease. The question of whether these four features can be defined simply as APD, requires further confirmation and study.</p>
