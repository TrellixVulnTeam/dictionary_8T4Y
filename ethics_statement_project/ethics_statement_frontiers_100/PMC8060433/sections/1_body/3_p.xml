<p>We analyzed the dermoscopy pictures of all 39 patients (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Dermoscopic images revealed that there are nine features: (1) a yellow-brown homogeneous structureless area in the center of the lesion were found in 38 of the 39 cases, the accrue rate was about 97.43% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>); (2) dotted and linear vessel distribution radially were found in 38 of the 39 cases, the accrue rate was about 97.43% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>); (3) a dam shape uplift at the periphery of the lesion was found in 37 of the 39 cases, the accrue rate was about 94.87% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>); (4) a white irregular halo surrounding the lesion was found in 34 of the 39 cases, the accrue rate was about 87.18% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>); (5) a thin scale ring surrounding the lesion was found in 21 of the 39 cases, the accrue rate was about 53.84% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>); (6) a pink background in the lesion were found in 16 of the 39 cases, the accrue rate was about 41.02% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>); (7) we found an an orange background in the lesion in 12 of the 39 cases, the accrue rate was about 30.77% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>); (8) we found a red background in the lesion in 11 of the 39 cases, the accrue rate is about 28.20% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>); (9) a pigment structure surrounding the lesion were found in 3 of the 39 cases, the accrue rate is about 7.69% (
