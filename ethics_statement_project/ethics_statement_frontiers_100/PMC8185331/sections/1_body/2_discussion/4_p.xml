<p>Anti-PD-1 monotherapy provided limited clinical benefit in CRC patients with pMMR/MSS tumors. Recently, more studies had been actively exploring the efficacy of immunotherapy combination treatments to increase immune response. In a phase 2 study, patients with advanced refractory CRC received the combined immune checkpoint inhibition (Durvalumab and Tremelimumab), which resulted in significant improvement in median OS. Patients who were MSS with plasma TMB â‰¥ 28 mutations/Mb had the greatest OS benefit (

Until the case was written, the patient had been continuing the combined therapy with excellent performance status and quality of life.
