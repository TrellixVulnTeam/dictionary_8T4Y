<p>Focusing on TMB, the FDA granted approval to Pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients with TMB-High solid tumor. Thus, for colorectal SCC patients, TMB had become the next predictive biomarker for PD-1 blockade treatment. The TMB of our case was 18.99 mutations/Mb, defining TMB-High and predicting a good efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy. Studies had shown that TMB-High had a strong association with MSI-H in most gastrointestinal tumors, indicating that MSI-H was the main cause of TMB-high. But in some gastrointestinal SCC with MSS status, such as anal and esophageal cancers, could be shown as TMB-High (
