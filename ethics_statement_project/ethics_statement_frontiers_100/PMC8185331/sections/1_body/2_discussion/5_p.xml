<p>The colorectal SCC is a quite rare tumor. There are no large cohort studies and standard clinical treatment guidelines. Our case report indicates that anti-PD-1 therapy with chemotherapy may have a promising anti-tumor activity in rectosigmoid-junction SCC. TMB and PD-L1 expression might be the potential predictors for colorectal SCC patients who would benefit from PD-1 blockade. However, further clinical studies with larger samples are required to validate the clinical activity of PD-1 blockade in colorectal SCC patients and relevant predictive biomarkers.</p>
