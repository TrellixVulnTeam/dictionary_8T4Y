<p>The KEYNOTE series studies had reported that an excellent response rate of Pembrolizumab in several advanced PD-L1-positive malignancies (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, PD-L1 expression had not yet been approved as predictive biomarker for PD-1 blockade therapy in CRC. A gastrointestinal cancer statistical study reported that colorectal adenocarcinoma always harbored low PD-L1 expression and MSI-H, but esophageal SCC always harbored high PD-L1 expression and MSS (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This might indicate that there was a difference of PD-L1 expression between SCC and adenocarcinoma in gastrointestinal cancers. However, data about PD-L1 expression level in colorectal SCC patients are limit. Our case report indicates that high PD-L1 expression might be associated with an increased response to PD-1 blockade treatment in colorectal SCC patients. Thus, for the colorectal SCC patients, especially the ones with MSS status, it might be valuable to evaluate PD-L1 expression in anti-PD-1 treatment decision.
