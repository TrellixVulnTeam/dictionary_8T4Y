<p>Besides MSI status, tumor mutation burden (TMB) and PD-L1 expression are the most promising biomarkers of immunotherapy in CRC. Recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Pembrolizumab for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with tissue tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-High, â‰¥10 mutations/mb). And PD-L1 expression has been extensively evaluated as a predictive biomarker of anti-PD-1 therapy in some tumor types, such as non-small-cell lung carcinoma, gastric cancer, and oesophageal cancer (

Here, we reported one rectal SCC patient that was successfully treated with PD-1 blocker plus chemotherapy, who showed high PD-L1 expression and TMB-High with a pMMR/MSS status.
