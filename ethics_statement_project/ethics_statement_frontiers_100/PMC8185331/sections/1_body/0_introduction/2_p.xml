<p>Blocking programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) therapy has exhibited promising efficacy in some colorectal cancer (CRC). Studies have observed that CRC patients with deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) or microsatellite instability- high (MSI-H) exhibited higher response rates to PD-1 blockade monotherapy (

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network clinical practice guidelines in colon/rectum cancer Version 4.2020 recognizes either Nivolumab, Nivolumab+Ipilimumab, or Pembrolizumab as acceptable standard of care treatment options for patients with dMMR/MSI-H metastatic CRC that have progressed after first-line chemotherapy. Unfortunately, only about 3% to 6% of advanced staged colorectal patients exhibited dMMR or MSI-H characters (
