<p>Primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the colorectum is extremely rare, reportedly comprising 0.25% to 0.85% of all colorectal carcinomas. Colorectal SCC generally presents at an advanced stage and is associated with a poor prognosis (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Comparing with adenocarcinomas, survival in colorectal SCC is poorer (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Chemoradiation has been used as a primary treatment for colorectal SCC, with no universally accepted regimen. However, given to the poor outcome, more effective and standard treatments are urgently needed.
