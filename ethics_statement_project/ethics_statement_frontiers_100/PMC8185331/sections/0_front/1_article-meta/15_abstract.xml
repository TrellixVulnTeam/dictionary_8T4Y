 <p>Colorectal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is extremely rare and associated with a poor prognosis. And the pMMR/MSS colorectal cancer is related to a limited response to programmed death ligand-1 (PD-1) blockade monotherapy. However, the clinical activity of PD-1 blockade monotherapy or combination therapy in colorectal SCC is unknown. One patient with rectosigmoid-junction SCC was treated with PD-1 blockade combined with chemotherapy. After 3 months of PD-1 blockade and chemotherapy, the computed tomography imaging showed that this patient achieved a partial response. The next generation sequencing and immunohistochemistry analysis showed that the patient had tumors with proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) and microsatellite stability (MSS), strong PD-L1 expression, and tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-High), respectively. This case suggests that PD-1 blockade combined with chemotherapy might be an effective therapy for colorectal SCC with pMMR/MSS status. Moreover, the PD-L1 expression and TMB might be the potential predictors of PD-1 blockade response for colorectal SCC patients.</p>
