<p>The patient's Color Doppler ultrasound and superior vena cava Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) examination showed tricuspid valve vegetation, moderate tricuspid insufficiency, scattered infection in both lungs, thrombosis in right internal jugular vein and superior vena cava, and chronic embolism of right pulmonary artery (

Transesophageal echocardiography showed that the atrium of the anterior tricuspid valve had multiple moderate echo masses, which were about 17 × 15 mm above the apex and 18 × 10 mm near the valve root, and swayed back and forth with the opening and closing of the leaflets. Some of the masses seemed to be connected with the septal valve tip. A few masses attached to the apex of the tricuspid valve were slightly detached into the coronary sinus orifice with the leaflet when the valve was closed (
