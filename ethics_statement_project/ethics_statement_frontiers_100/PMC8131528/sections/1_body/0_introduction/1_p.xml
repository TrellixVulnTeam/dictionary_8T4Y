<p>Fungal endocarditis (FE) is a rare infection, accounting for &lt;2% of Infective endocarditis (IE) (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), which is usually caused by 
 <italic>Candida</italic> (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> is a kind of Aspergillus. Although there were some reports of 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> endocarditis (AE) in hemodialysis patients, the reports of IE caused by 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> are rare (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case employing mNGS to diagnose 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> caused IE in a patient with long term hemodialysis.
