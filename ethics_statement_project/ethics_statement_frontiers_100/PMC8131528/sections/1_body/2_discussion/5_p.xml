<p>There was still room to improve. In this case of suspected catheter infection, though the catheter was pulled out in time, hemodialysis was continued, with the change of position of the dialysis catheter from the right to the left internal jugular vein indwelling catheter. This might have increased the risk of re-infection. With the timely diagnosis and treatment, the patient survived and continued the hemodialysis after discharge. However, for hospitalized patients with IE in renal replacement therapy, Fernandez Cean et al. found that temporary conversion to peritoneal dialysis (PD) significantly reduced in-hospital mortality. Compared with continuous hemodialysis, the mortality rate of PD decreased from 55.5 to 8.3% (
