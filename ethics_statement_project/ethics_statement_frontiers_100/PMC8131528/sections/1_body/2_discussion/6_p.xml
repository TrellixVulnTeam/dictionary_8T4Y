<p>For patients with long-term indwelling catheter, we should be aware of the possibility of fungal infection. For high-risk patients with fungal infection, early identification of pathogens and antifungal treatment is very important. In our case, the patient recovered after adjusting the specific treatment according to the results of mNGS. However, after the identification of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>, antimicrobial sensitivity examination was not conducted due to the limitation of our routine practice. In addition, continuous hemodialysis was not changed to peritoneal dialysis after the suspected catherter infection, which might increase the possibility of re-infection. Nevertheless, the antibiotics worked well fortunately, and the patient survived and continued the hemodialysis after discharge. For fungal infective endocarditis which needs surgical intervention, timely and thorough surgery combined with long-term drug treatment can achieve better results and reduce the mortality of such patients.
