<p>In cases of endocarditis with negative blood culture, for accurate and early diagnosis, 1,3-Î²-D-glucans (BDG) and galactomannan (GM) are promising approaches for AE to initiate antifungal therapy prior to vulvar dysfunction and heart failure. As a cell-wall biomarker of 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, GM has been widely used to diagnose invasive aspergillosis in neutropenic patients. In our case, because fungal infection was not considered at first, the patient was not given screening tests for fungal infections such as G tests and GM tests.
