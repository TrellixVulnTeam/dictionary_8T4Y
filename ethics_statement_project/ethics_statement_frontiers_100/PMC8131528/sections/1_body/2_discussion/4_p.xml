<p>In our case, we didn't perform antifungal-susceptibility testing for the patient, because this testing is not a routine workup in our institution. Due to rising azole-resistant infections and differences in antifungal susceptibility profiles among strains in types and species of 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, performing this test is crucial for treatment (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, since our institution does not routinely conduct this test, we had to choose the best treatment according to the guidelines. For treatment of AE, voriconazole 4 mg/kg twice daily is the first line antifungals recommended, and liposomal amphotericin B and posaconazole are the second- and third-line antifungals, respectively (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In our case, the patient used voriconazole 400 mg 12 hourly for 2 doses then 200 mg every 12 h. After about 1 year of voriconazole treatment, the patient is still in good condition now.
