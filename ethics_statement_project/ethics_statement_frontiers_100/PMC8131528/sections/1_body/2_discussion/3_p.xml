<p>In recent years, new non-cultural methods have been developed to detect the presence of fungi in blood. These methods include mannan antigen and antibody test, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time PCR target, and mNGS (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Many studies have showed that PCR of blood may help in rapid diagnosis. Due to uncertainty and lack of standardization, recommendations of PCR for routine use in clinical practice of patients with AE remains ambiguous. In this case, we carried out the mNGS gene detection of venous blood microorganism for the patient, and the results showed that it was 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> infection. Although the results of genetic tests could not fully determine whether the patient was infected with 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>, due to the dependence of 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> clinical diagnosis on the results of microbial culture (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), they provided strong evidence for our anti-fungal therapy. And this treatment had achieved good clinical results. The patient's tricuspid vegetative culture and mNGS results were consistent, both showing 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>, and ultimately determined that the patient was infected with 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>. mNGS is an emerging and evolving technology that started to be widely applied in clinical diagnoses. It could detect a greater number of microbial species, with high sensitivity and specificity in many studies. However, there are still difficulties, such as to identify true pathogens from environment contaminants and to distinguish viable bacteria from dead ones. More efforts are needed to further standardize and validate this method, especially with respect to sample preparation and data processing.
