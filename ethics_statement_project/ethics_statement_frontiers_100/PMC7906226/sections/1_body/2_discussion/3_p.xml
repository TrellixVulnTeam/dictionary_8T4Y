<p>The use of self-anchoring barbed suture saves time but is also associated with several risks. In the present case, the free suture in the abdominal cavity was firmly fixed to the mesentery of the small bowel, forming a rivet point. The mesentery and small intestine became entangled at this point during peristalsis, causing intestinal volvulus. If surgery is not performed in a timely manner in such cases, more serious ischemic intestinal obstruction will occur and intestinal necrosis may even develop. Sartori et al. (

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) reported a case of SBO caused by barbed sutures 6 weeks after laparoscopic myomectomy. Api et al. (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) established a rat model and found that barbed suture material might be associated with adhesion formation when used intra-abdominally and that these adhesions could not be prevented by peritonization. Notably, these clinical cases and animal models had a common feature: the barbed suture was left in the abdominal cavity and directly contacted the intestine or mesentery.
