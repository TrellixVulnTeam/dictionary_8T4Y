<p>A 62-year-old man with a body mass index of 18.5 kg/m
 <sup>2</sup> presented with symptomatic bilateral inguinal hernias. The bilateral inguinal hernias were evident on clinical and ultrasound examinations. TAPP repair was performed by an experienced surgeon at the Department of Gastroenterology Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University. After stripping the right hernia sac, a 15- ×10-cm partially absorbable mesh (Ultrapro UMM1, Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical, USA) was fixed at multiple points with 2 mL of medical glue (Compont® Beijing Compont Medical Devices Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) using a laparoscopic sprayer. V-loc™ absorbable barbed suture was used to close the peritoneum, leaving about 2 cm of exposed suture in the abdominal cavity (
