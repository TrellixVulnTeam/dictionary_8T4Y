<p>Self-anchoring barbed suture has a wide range of indications and good performance. More importantly, however, it must be used correctly to reduce the risk of complications. The cases discussed herein emphasize that although barbed sutures can be applied more rapidly and conveniently under laparoscopy, the free end of the barbed suture remaining in the abdominal cavity may adhere to the intestine or mesentery, resulting in an intestinal obstruction. This complication can be avoided by either preventing exposure of excess suture in the abdominal cavity or using conventional absorbable sutures for peritoneal closure. A high degree of suspicion for this complication is warranted in patients who show typical signs after surgery. Early diagnosis and treatment should be ensured to avoid adverse consequences such as intestinal necrosis, which will seriously affect the prognosis.</p>
