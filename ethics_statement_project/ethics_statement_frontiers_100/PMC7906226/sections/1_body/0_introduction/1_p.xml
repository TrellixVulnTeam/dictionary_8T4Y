<p>Since the 1990s, laparoscopic inguinal hernioplasty has been performed more frequently worldwide. The laparoscopic approach can be either transperitoneal or retroperitoneal. Transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair is commonly performed because of its advantages as a minimally invasive approach, resulting in less postoperative discomfort, better cosmesis, and a shorter hospital stay (

One of these novel sutures is V-Locâ„¢ (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA), which consists of a unidirectional barbed absorbable thread equipped with a surgical needle at one end and a loop at the opposite end to secure the suture. However, as demonstrated in several case reports (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), a potential drawback to the use of barbed suture is that exposed suture barbs may catch on the adjacent small bowel, mesentery, or omentum and cause serosal injury, obstruction, or volvulus. We herein present a case of postoperative small bowel obstruction (SBO) after TAPP repair that was directly related to the use of barbed suture.
