<p>The current study investigated changes in day-to-day mental health and well-being of Australians as they experienced the 2019/2020 Australian bushfire and COVID-19 public health disasters. Several patterns of change in mental health and well-being differentiated these crises. Among 12 ESR variables monitored regularly by the smartphone app, MoodPrism, the two clearest indicators of population mental health and well-being are symptoms of depression and anxiety. Anxiety symptoms were not significantly impacted by the bushfires, but increased significantly with the onset of COVID-19. In contrast, depressive symptoms increased significantly during the bushfires, and remained elevated with the onset of COVID-19. Corresponding significant (and cumulative) decreases were also observed across several indices of positive functioning, elucidating the broad spectrum impacts of public health disasters on mental health and well-being.</p>
