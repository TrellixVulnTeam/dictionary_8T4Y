<p>Notwithstanding these limitations, this study demonstrates the impact of two distinct and consecutive community disasters on Australian mental health. Importantly, effects reported here are derived from real-time monitoring of day-to-day experience, and reflect changes in both mental health and well-being. This provides insight into an Australian profile of mental health response, highlighting specific areas of resilience and vulnerability. Such information can be used to inform the development of pre-emptive public health interventions or individual clinical treatment, to improve current treatment approaches and preparedness for potential future community disasters. By tailoring interventions to strengthen key areas of vulnerability, and support important mechanisms underlying resilience, individual capacities to cope under adverse circumstances may be improved, and the mental health consequences of community disasters may be more effectively managed.</p>
