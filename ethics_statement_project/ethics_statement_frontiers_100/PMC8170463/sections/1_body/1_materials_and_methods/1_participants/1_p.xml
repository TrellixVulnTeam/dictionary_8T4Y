<p>Data were collected from 1,509 participants who downloaded the experience-sampling application (MoodPrism; 
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Rickard et al., 2016</xref>). A subset of 775 participants who used the app for at least 4 days (thus completing a minimum of four individual daily reports) was retained for data analysis. Participants were aged 13 years or above, and approximately 89% of the sample was located on the East Coast of Australia (where the 2019â€“2020 bushfires impacted). Although no other demographics were available from this sample, the app was available

For example, younger demographics more familiar with smartphone technology could be more inclined to engage with the MoodPrism app. Similarly, individuals already experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety may more readily download the app; in previous research utilizing smartphone-based mental health apps, individuals with likely diagnosable depression and anxiety have been well-represented in study samples (

It should also be noted that those with limited access to technology (low digital inclusion) are unlikely to be represented in this sample, a group that may be disproportionately impacted by the primary and secondary stressors associated with both the bushfires and coronavirus pandemic.
