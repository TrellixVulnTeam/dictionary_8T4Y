<p>Taken together, existing research highlights three important considerations: (a) the importance of collecting pre-pandemic data comparison data to enable some level of causal inference for the subjective experiences of community disasters, (b) the need for longer term observation to elucidate the evolution of mental health effects of Australians across multiple state emergencies, and (c) the need for assessing positive indices of mental health. In this paper, we report on experience-sampling data collected in Australian smartphone users, highlighting clinically relevant changes in mental health and well-being outcomes across three key time periods: baseline (normal public health); bushfires; and COVID-19 pandemic. Using intensively sampled longitudinal data collected by the MoodPrism app, we aim to provide a moving snapshot of the mental health and well-being impacts of the 2019-2020 Bushfire crisis and the coronavirus pandemic among Australian app users.</p>
