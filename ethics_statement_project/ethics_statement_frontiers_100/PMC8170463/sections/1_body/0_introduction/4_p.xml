<p>Two EMA studies have examined the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on mental health focusing on the initial weeks of the outbreak. 
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Fried et al. (2020)</xref> examined the short-term dynamics of mental health, social connectedness, and COVID-19 related concerns of Dutch university students over 2 weeks in late March. During this time, they found minimal change in mental health symptom severity and social connection. Due to the brief timeframe examined and absence of pre-pandemic comparison period, it is unclear if the stability of mental health indices was unique to the coronavirus period. In contrast, 
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Huckins et al. (2020)</xref> reported on the mental health of 217 university students enrolled in the US-based longitudinal EMA study, StudentLife. Across a 10 week period from January 6, 2020, they found that symptoms of depression and anxiety were greater when compared to previous academic terms. Further, a specific spike in symptom severity was observed in the final 3 weeks of observation that coincided with home isolation restrictions.
