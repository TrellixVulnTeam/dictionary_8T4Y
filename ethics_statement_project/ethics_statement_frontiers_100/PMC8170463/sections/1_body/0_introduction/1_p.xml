<p>In a recent position paper, 
 <xref rid="ref155" ref-type="bibr">Holmes et al. (2020)</xref> urged prioritization of research which monitors and reports on mental health and emotional well-being in response to COVID-19. Survey research has shown that mental health and well-being significantly declined during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Fisher et al. (2020)</xref> surveyed 13,829 Australians during the first month of COVID-19 restrictions. They found that symptoms of depression and anxiety were significantly higher than reported in normative data, with over 45% of the sample reporting at least mild symptoms of depression or anxiety. In addition to this, preliminary survey data from 2,297 Australians sampled across 1 week in April showed that there had been a 22% increase in boredom, 15% increase in stress, 14% increase in loneliness, coupled with a 15% decrease in optimism and 14% drop in happiness compared to respondents self-reported ratings of their mental health in general (
