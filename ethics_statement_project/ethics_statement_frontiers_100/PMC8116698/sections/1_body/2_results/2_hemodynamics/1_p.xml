<p>The WSS ratio, velocity ratio, and pressure ratio values were analyzed (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Statistical analysis demonstrated that pressure ratio values were significantly higher in A1 segments, M1 segments, and M2 + M3 segments after obliteration of the aneurysms (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.048 in A1 segments, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.017 in M1 segments, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001 in M2 + M3 segments). Velocity ratio values were significantly higher in M1 segments and M2 + M3 segments after obliteration of the aneurysms (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.047 in M1 segments, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.046 in M2 + M3 segments). The WSS ratio values were similar in MCAs and ACAs for both groups (
