<p>According to the results of our study, the percentage of the pressure ratio increase after obliteration of aneurysms was not correlated with aneurysm volume. Our study suggested that the angle between the aneurysm and the parent artery was the factor accounting for the pressure increase after obliteration of aneurysms. It was only a preliminary finding based on the results of our study. Further studies are required to identify which patients are at a higher risk of hyperperfusion after obliteration of aneurysms.</p>
