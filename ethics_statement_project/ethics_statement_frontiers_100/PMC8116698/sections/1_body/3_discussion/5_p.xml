<p>There are few findings regarding risk factors of the appearance of hyperperfusion after obliteration of aneurysms (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Brunozzi et al. reported that the hemodynamic changes in the arteries distal to the aneurysms after flow diverter device deployment were independent from aneurysm size (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Our CFD study of the models suggested that a large aneurysm can induce pressure loss, resulting in hyperperfusion after obliteration of aneurysm. The aneurysmal angle was the factor accounting for pressure loss.
