<p>The incidence of remote ICH appears to be higher for large aneurysms than for small aneurysms (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that pressure and velocity of distal arteries might become higher after obliteration of large aneurysms.
