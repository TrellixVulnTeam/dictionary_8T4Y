<p>Limitations to this study include its retrospective nature, a small sample size, and single institution design. Further study with a larger number of patients would be necessary to validate our findings. Patient-specific flow-boundary information was unavailable, which might affect the results. Virtual aneurysm removal might underestimate or overestimate the size of the healthy lumen. This study only involved large intracranial aneurysms of ICAs, which limited the generalization of the study results.</p>
