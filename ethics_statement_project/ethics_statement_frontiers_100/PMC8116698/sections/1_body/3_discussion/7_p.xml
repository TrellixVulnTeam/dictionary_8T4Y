<p>Brunozzi et al. demonstrated that the mean flow velocity of MCA increased especially in patients with delayed ipsilateral ICH after flow diverter device deployment (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Chiu et al. reported a case of increasing cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume distal to the aneurysm after flow diverter treatment (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In our study, velocity ratio values became higher in M2 + M3 segments after obliteration of aneurysms.
