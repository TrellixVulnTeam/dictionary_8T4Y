<p>The relationship of geometry and hemodynamics is mutually causal. The hemodynamics of arteries distal to the aneurysms may be changed after obliteration of aneurysms. Many studies have concentrated on the hemodynamic changes within the aneurysms after treatment of intracranial aneurysms. However, hemodynamic changes within distal arterial trees after aneurysm treatment are much less understood.</p>
