<p>WSS can be viewed as the frictional force applied against the vascular wall by the movement of blood. Study of the WSS of the arteries distal to the aneurysms after the obliteration of large intracranial aneurysms is sparse. In a study by Shakur et al., the WSS values were higher in the ipsilateral MCA among patients with hemorrhage after flow diverter device placement (
