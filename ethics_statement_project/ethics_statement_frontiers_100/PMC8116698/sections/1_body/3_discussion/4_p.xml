<p>After obliteration of aneurysms, blood flow through the vessels distal to the aneurysms may suddenly increase. Increased flow rate and pressure distal to the aneurysms after clipping or endovascular treatment have been demonstrated in several studies. Brunozzi et al. reported that the ratio of ipsilateral MCA to systemic systolic and mean blood pressure increased after flow diverter device deployment (

Compared to the ACAs, MCAs had a higher pressure increase, indicating the higher risk of HPS in the areas supplied by MCAs.
