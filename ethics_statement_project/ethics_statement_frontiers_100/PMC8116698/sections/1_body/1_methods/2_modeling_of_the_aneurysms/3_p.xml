<p>Patient-specific geometries were generated by three-dimensional rotational angiography. The surface images were reconstructed using Mimics software (Materialize Co., Leuven, Belgium). To mimic the arterial geometries after complete obliteration of the aneurysms, the aneurysms were virtually removed.</p>
