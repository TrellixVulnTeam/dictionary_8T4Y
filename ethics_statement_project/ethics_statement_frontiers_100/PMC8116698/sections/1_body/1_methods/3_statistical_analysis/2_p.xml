<p>SPSS 19.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analyses. Statistical significance was assessed by the application of paired

The association between the percentage of pressure ratio increase after obliteration of aneurysms and aneurysmal angles was quantified using Pearson's correlation coefficients. All tests used a significance level of
