<p>Intracranial aneurysm is a common disease in the general population (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (HPS) and remote intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) after treatment of the large intracranial aneurysm have been noted (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The mechanism remains unknown, but it was speculated that the alteration of the geometry of the artery might lead to hemodynamic changes of distal arterial trees, which may contribute to cerebral HPS and remote ICH; nonetheless, this speculation has not been well studied (
