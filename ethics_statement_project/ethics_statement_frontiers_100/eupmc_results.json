During the course of this study, no transmission to healthcare workers occurred. <b>Conclusion:</b> CCT enabled 80% of patients to be discharged within the first 24 h, the majority of whom were discharged from the emergency room. It was able to identify critical anatomy facilitating appropriate revascularization. This snapshot study warrants exploration of the role of CCT in ACS further particularly since the latest European Society of Cardiology's Non-STEACS guidelines suggest a role for CCT in the evaluation of low risk ACS.", "Keywords": ["Infection", "Revascularization", "acute coronary syndrome", "Cardiac Computed Tomography", "Covid-19"], "pdflinks":

In addition to caring for patients, nurses are also responsible for looking after themselves and their families. The current study aimed to explore nurses' ethics in the care of patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A descriptive qualitative approach was adopted in order to gain an in-depth understanding of nurses' experiences of caring for patients with coronavirus. A purposive sample of 10 nurses working with patients with COVID-19 was recruited. Interviews were held with the nurses, and content analysis of the interviews was conducted.

Lung function decline is associated with pulmonary infections, neutrophil infiltration and inflammation. In CF, neutrophils have an altered phenotype. In this pilot study, we aimed to determine if signals of dysfunctional neutrophil responses were evident early in life and whether these signals may be associated with lung damage in later childhood. We examined the pulmonary protein profiles of 14 clinical stable infants and pre-school children with CF employing the aptamer-based affinity platform, SOMAscan\u00ae. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was performed on all children after age 6 years and Brody score calculated. A Spearman's rank order correlation analysis and Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment was used to correlate protein concentrations in early life to Brody scores in later childhood. Early life concentrations of azurocidin and myeloperoxidase, were positively correlated with Brody score after age 6 (<i>p</i> = 0.0041 and <i>p</i> = 0.0182, respectively). Four other neutrophil associated proteins; Complement C3 (<i>p</i> = 0.0026), X-ray repair CCP 6 (<i>p</i> = 0.0059), C3a anaphylatoxin des Arginine (<i>p</i> = 0.0129) and cytokine receptor common subunit gamma (<i>p</i> = 0.0214) were all negatively correlated with Brody scores. Interestingly, patients with more severe lung damage after age 6 had significantly lower levels of IL-22 in early years of life (<i>p</i> = 0.0243).

Lung function decline is associated with pulmonary infections, neutrophil infiltration and inflammation. In CF, neutrophils have an altered phenotype. In this pilot study, we aimed to determine if signals of dysfunctional neutrophil responses were evident early in life and whether these signals may be associated with lung damage in later childhood. We examined the pulmonary protein profiles of 14 clinical stable infants and pre-school children with CF employing the aptamer-based affinity platform, SOMAscan\u00ae. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was performed on all children after age 6 years and Brody score calculated. A Spearman's rank order correlation analysis and Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment was used to correlate protein concentrations in early life to Brody scores in later childhood. Early life concentrations of azurocidin and myeloperoxidase, were positively correlated with Brody score after age 6 (<i>p</i> = 0.0041 and <i>p</i> = 0.0182, respectively). Four other neutrophil associated proteins; Complement C3 (<i>p</i> = 0.0026), X-ray repair CCP 6 (<i>p</i> = 0.0059), C3a anaphylatoxin des Arginine (<i>p</i> = 0.0129) and cytokine receptor common subunit gamma (<i>p</i> = 0.0214) were all negatively correlated with Brody scores. Interestingly, patients with more severe lung damage after age 6 had significantly lower levels of IL-22 in early years of life (<i>p</i> = 0.0243). IL-22 has scarcely been reported to have implications in CF. Identification of early biomarkers that may predict more severe disease progression is particularly important for the future development of early therapeutic interventions in CF disease.

Logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors associated with transient and long-term hypoparathyroidism. <b>Results:</b> A total of 537 patients were collected. The patients' average age included in the study was 47.3 \u00b1 12.7 years old, including 135 males (25.1%) and 702 females (74.9%). There were 194 patients (36.1%) with transient postoperative hypoparathyroidism, and 21 patients (3.9%) had long-term postoperative hypoparathyroidism. After multivariate analysis, the main risk factors related to postoperative transient hypoparathyroidism were gender (<i>P</i> = 0.038, OR 0.686), combined lymph node dissection (<i>P</i> = 0.008, OR 1.569), and the maximum diameter of the thyroid (<i>P</i> = 0.011, OR 1.192), second operation (<i>P</i> = 0.001, OR 1.974), preoperative blood calcium (<i>P</i> < 0.001, OR 0.028).

CLNM) is associated with high recurrence rate in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients. However, sensitivity in investigating large-volume CLNM on preoperative ultrasonography (US) is not high. The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical factors associated with large-volume CLNM in clinical N0 PTC patients. We reviewed 976 PTC patients undergoing total thyroidectomy with central lymph node dissection during 2017 to 2019. The rate of large-volume LNM was 4.1% (40 of 967 patients). Multivariate analysis showed that male gender and young age (age<45 years old) were independent risk factors for large-volume CLNM with odds ratios [(OR), 95% confidence interval (CI)] of 2.034 (1.015-4.073) and 2.997 (1.306-6.876), respectively. In papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC), capsule invasion was associated with large-volume CLNM with OR (95% CI) of 2.845 (1.110-7.288). In conventional papillary thyroid cancer (CPTC), tumor diameter (>2cm) was associated with large-volume CLNM, with OR (95% CI) 3.757 (1.061-13.310), by multivariate analysis.

However, sensitivity in investigating large-volume CLNM on preoperative ultrasonography (US) is not high. The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical factors associated with large-volume CLNM in clinical N0 PTC patients. We reviewed 976 PTC patients undergoing total thyroidectomy with central lymph node dissection during 2017 to 2019. The rate of large-volume LNM was 4.1% (40 of 967 patients). Multivariate analysis showed that male gender and young age (age<45 years old) were independent risk factors for large-volume CLNM with odds ratios [(OR), 95% confidence interval (CI)] of 2.034 (1.015-4.073) and 2.997 (1.306-6.876), respectively. In papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC), capsule invasion was associated with large-volume CLNM with OR (95% CI) of 2.845 (1.110-7.288). In conventional papillary thyroid cancer (CPTC), tumor diameter (>2cm) was associated with large-volume CLNM, with OR (95% CI) 3.757 (1.061-13.310), by multivariate analysis. In ROC curve analysis on the diameter of the CPTC tumor, the Area Under Curve (AUC) =0.682(p=0.013), the best cut-off point was selected as 2.0cm. In conclusion, male gender and young age were predictors for large-volume CLNM of cN0 PTC. cN0 PTMC patient with capsule invasion and cN0 CPTC patient with tumor diameter >2cm were correlated with large-volume CLNM.

However, little is known about the association between sleep timing, an important behavior marker of circadian rhythms, and dementia risk in older adults, and whether this is independent of sleep duration or quality. <b>Methods:</b> We included data from 1,051 community-dwelling older men and women (aged\u2265 60y) without dementia from the Shanghai Aging Study. At baseline, participants reported sleep timing, duration, and quality using the Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (CPSQI). Dementia diagnosis over the following 7.3 years was determined by neurologists using DSM-IV criteria. We used Cox proportional hazards models to examine the association between bedtime (before 9 p.m., after 11 p.m. vs. 9-11 p.m.), rise time (before 6 a.m., after 8 a.m. vs. 6-8 a.m.), and risk of dementia. <b>Results:</b> A total of 238 (22.8%), 675 (64.5%), and 133 (12.7%) participants reported going to bed before 9 p.m., between 9 and 11 p.m., and after 11 p.m., respectively, while 272 (26%), 626 (59.9%), and 148 (14.2%) reported getting up before 6 a.m., between 6 and 8 a.m., and after 8 a.m., respectively. Participants who reported going to bed earlier had a lower education level, were less likely to be smokers, more likely to have hypertension or diabetes, and had longer sleep duration but poorer sleep quality compared to those who reported a later bedtime. We found 47 incidents of dementia among 584 participants followed up over an average of 7.3 years.

However, little is known about the association between sleep timing, an important behavior marker of circadian rhythms, and dementia risk in older adults, and whether this is independent of sleep duration or quality. <b>Methods:</b> We included data from 1,051 community-dwelling older men and women (aged\u2265 60y) without dementia from the Shanghai Aging Study. At baseline, participants reported sleep timing, duration, and quality using the Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (CPSQI). Dementia diagnosis over the following 7.3 years was determined by neurologists using DSM-IV criteria. We used Cox proportional hazards models to examine the association between bedtime (before 9 p.m., after 11 p.m. vs. 9-11 p.m.), rise time (before 6 a.m., after 8 a.m. vs. 6-8 a.m.), and risk of dementia. <b>Results:</b> A total of 238 (22.8%), 675 (64.5%), and 133 (12.7%) participants reported going to bed before 9 p.m., between 9 and 11 p.m., and after 11 p.m., respectively, while 272 (26%), 626 (59.9%), and 148 (14.2%) reported getting up before 6 a.m., between 6 and 8 a.m., and after 8 a.m., respectively.

They have expressed concerns regarding applied behavior analysis (ABA) interventions on a number of grounds, one of which is the prevalence of conflicts of interests (COIs) among autism intervention researchers. These concerns are now also being addressed by non-autistic researchers. COIs can introduce bias into the research process, and allow researchers to demonstrate positive effects for interventions that are not actually effective. Despite these concerns, there are no studies to date that examine the prevalence of COIs in behavioral journals. Because ABA services are routinely provided to autistic people in the United States as a means to address difficulties experienced by autistic people, this is an important area of investigation. We tallied author COIs in articles published over a 1-year period that tested, commented on, or reviewed ABA autism intervention strategies, extracted from eight journals devoted to publishing behavioral research. We coded included studies for COIs related to researcher employment as an ABA clinical provider or a training consultant to ABA clinical providers. We found that 84% of studies had at least one author with this type of COI, but they were only disclosed as COIs in 2% of studies. Additionally, 87% of studies with statements claiming the authors did not have COIs, were authored by researchers found to have clinical/training consultancy COIs.

They have expressed concerns regarding applied behavior analysis (ABA) interventions on a number of grounds, one of which is the prevalence of conflicts of interests (COIs) among autism intervention researchers. These concerns are now also being addressed by non-autistic researchers. COIs can introduce bias into the research process, and allow researchers to demonstrate positive effects for interventions that are not actually effective. Despite these concerns, there are no studies to date that examine the prevalence of COIs in behavioral journals. Because ABA services are routinely provided to autistic people in the United States as a means to address difficulties experienced by autistic people, this is an important area of investigation. We tallied author COIs in articles published over a 1-year period that tested, commented on, or reviewed ABA autism intervention strategies, extracted from eight journals devoted to publishing behavioral research. We coded included studies for COIs related to researcher employment as an ABA clinical provider or a training consultant to ABA clinical providers. We found that 84% of studies had at least one author with this type of COI, but they were only disclosed as COIs in 2% of studies. Additionally, 87% of studies with statements claiming the authors did not have COIs, were authored by researchers found to have clinical/training consultancy COIs. Pervasive, undisclosed COIs likely lead to researcher bias, and could at least partially account for persistent poor quality research in this area. The high prevalence of COIs among this research corroborates the concerns expressed by many autistic people. The autism community - including autistic people, autism researchers, and other stakeholders - should be aware of the prevalence of undisclosed COIs in this literature and take this into account when using, providing, or recommending ABA services.", "Keywords": ["Autism", "Applied Behavior Analysis", "Conflicts Of Interest", "Intervention \u2013 Behavioral", "Researcher Ethics"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8131529?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Frontiers in psychology", "authorinfo": ["Bottema-Beutel K", "Crowley S"], "title": "Pervasive Undisclosed Conflicts of Interest in Applied Behavior Analysis Autism Literature."}, "PMC8170025": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "34093292", "source": "MED", "pmid": "34093292", "pmcid": "PMC8170025", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC8170025"}, "doi": "10.3389/fpsyg.2021.513779", "title": "Individual Pride and Collective Pride: Differences Between Chinese and American Corpora.", "authorString": "Liu C, Li J, Chen C, Wu H, Yuan L, Yu G.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Liu C", "firstName": "Conghui", "lastName": "Liu", "initials": "C", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Li J", "firstName": "Jing", "lastName": "Li", "initials": "J", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Chen C", "firstName": "Chuansheng", "lastName": "Chen", "initials": "C", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Psychological Science, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, United States."}}}, {"fullName": "Wu H", "firstName": "Hanlin", "lastName": "Wu", "initials": "H", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Yuan L", "firstName": "Li", "lastName": "Yuan", "initials": "L", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Yu G", "firstName": "Guoliang", "lastName": "Yu", "initials": "G", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "School of Education, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China."}}}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": "altmetrics"}, "journalInfo": {"volume": "12", "journalIssueId": "3109444", "dateOfPublication": "2021", "monthOfPublication": "0", "yearOfPublication": "2021", "printPublicationDate": "2021-01-01", "journal": {"title": "Frontiers in psychology", "ISOAbbreviation": "Front Psychol", "medlineAbbreviation": "Front Psychol", "NLMid": "101550902", "ISSN": "1664-1078", "ESSN": "1664-1078"}}, "pubYear": "2021", "pageInfo": "513779", "abstractText": "This study investigated cross-cultural differences in individual pride and collective pride between Chinese and Americans using data from text corpora.
