<p>Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has become the preferred agent for the prophylaxis and treatment of thrombosis disease in patients as it has been shown to be safe and effective. It is also used as a bridging treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) and then was switched to treatment with oral anticoagulants (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al., 2018</xref>). As with any other anticoagulants, the main complication of LMWH therapy is bleeding. Most spontaneous gastrointestinal tract hematomas are caused by blunt abdominal trauma, which can also be secondary to anticoagulation therapy. Other risk factors for spontaneous gastrointestinal tract hematoma involve an endoscopic examination, coagulation disorder, and hemorrhagic disease (
