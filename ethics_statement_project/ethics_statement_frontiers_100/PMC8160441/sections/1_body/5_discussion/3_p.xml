<p>LMWH has become the preferred agent for the prophylaxis and treatment of thrombosis disease. Compared with heparin, it has been shown to be safe and effective, with reduced incidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) complication. LMWH molecular weight around 5000 Da is considerably variable in the chemical structure and has anti-factor Xa and anti-factor IIa activities (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Hao et al., 2019</xref>). LMWH has a lower anti-factor IIa activity and a relatively higher anti-factor Xa activity. Subcutaneous LMWH injection is absorbed completely, with a half-life period of 3–5 h. While routine monitoring of coagulation parameters is not usually necessary for LMWH, certain populations (including pregnant patients, children, obese patients, and patients with renal impairment) may benefit from the monitoring of anti-factor Xa activity to help guide drug therapy (

Hemorrhagic events that are reported usually include subcutaneous hematoma, hematuria, hemorrhinia, and gastrointestinal and retroperitoneal hemorrhage, while bowel hematoma rarely occurs. One of the mechanisms leading to bowel intramural hematoma might be the rapid decompression of splanchnic circulation due to decreased abdominal pressure, causing the bowel to rupture and bleed while he was on therapeutic anticoagulation therapy. There were limitations in our case; it was unclear whether LMWH dosage was a factor in the hemorrhage as the anti-Xa level was not monitored, and some other features such as genetic factors were also not been measured.
