He had normal coagulation, liver, and kidney function at admission, and had no medical history of hemorrhagic diseases. Abdominal pain occurred 3 days after subcutaneous injection of LMWH, and abdominal CT scan indicated an intramural hematoma of the colon. This colon hematoma ADR is not mentioned in the official product information of LMWH.
