<p>Spontaneous bowel intramural hematoma is a rare complication under anticoagulant therapy. Warfarin is the most common cause of spontaneous intramural small-bowel hematoma in adults. The incidence of bowel hematoma was reported to be 1/2500Â per year in patients receiving warfarin, and the incidence is relatively higher in males (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Limmer and Clement (2017</xref>) reported a case of successful conservative treatment of bowel hematoma caused by overdose anticoagulation with warfarin in a 71-year-old man. 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Shaw et al. (2005)</xref> reported one case of small-bowel hematoma in a child who received therapeutic doses of LMWH because of deep venous thrombosis. Approximately 85% of spontaneous intestinal intramural hematomas in patients with anticoagulant therapy occur in the small bowel (
