<p>Up to 10% of pediatric patients developing a cerebral tumor present an underlying genetic syndrome which contributes to an increased neoplastic risk. This has been observed especially in Neurofibromatosis, Tuberous Sclerosis, Gorlin syndrome, and Turcot syndrome. It is, therefore, possible to hypothesize that Haberland syndrome, similarly to most of the neurocutaneous syndromes, is associated with a predisposition to cancer development. Besides typical benign non-progressive intracranial or spinal lipomas, other neoplasms have been documented including ossificant fibromas, odontomas, and osteomas (

The first description is attributed to Brassesco et al., who provided the report about a 3-year-old male patient with a pilocytic astrocytoma located at the suprasellar region and extending throughout the hypothalamus and third ventricle (

Moreover, they raised the idea that Haberland syndrome, similarly to other cancer-prone genetic disorders, might be associated with an increased risk of developing low-grade gliomas (
