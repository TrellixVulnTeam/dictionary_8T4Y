<p>Brain MRI was repeated and documented a large expansive lesion in the left temporal-insular area, 7 × 4.5 × 4 cm in size, with a combined solid and cystic structure. The lesion was exerting a striking mass-effect on flanking structures, with right-sided midline shift, initial transtentorial herniation, and midbrain subluxation (

Histological analysis revealed a glioblastoma (World Health Organization -grade IV) characterized by small cells with marked angiogenesis and wide necrotic areas infiltrating both cerebral structures and meningeal sheaths. Ki-67 labeling was 40–45% of all cells in the resected tumor area. The immune-histochemical profile of the neoplasm showed positivity for ATRX and GFAP whereas p53 and PDL1 were negative. Tumor cells were negative for IDH1 and IDH2 genes. The tumor was also negative for EGFR, c-Myc, and N-Myc amplification, and no MGMT promoter methylation was detected.
