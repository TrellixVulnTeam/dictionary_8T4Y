<p>We describe the case of a 15-year-old female who was diagnosed with Haberland syndrome during infancy due to the presence of clinical signs including palpebral telangectasias, facial lipomas, angiomas of the trunk, scalp alopecia, scleral dermatolipomas, irideal abnormalities, and unilateral mandibular swelling. She also presented with severe mental and speech retardation and pharmacoresistant epilepsy. At the age of 18 months, she started to present with focal motor onset seizures with automatisms and impaired awareness. During early childhood, she presented with episodes of facial pallor, perioral cyanosis, and chewing automatisms without consciousness impairment. During school-age, focal non-motor onset autonomic aware seizures were observed. Therapy included combinations of Valproate, Topiramate, Phenobarbital, Delorazepam, Clonazepam, and Rufinamide.</p>
