<p>According to a WHO report on SARS-CoV-2, the disease has no specific manifestation, and the presentation can range from completely asymptomatic to severe pneumonia and death (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In our patient, the presenting symptom of the SARS-CoV-2 was a UEDVT due to a mass in the anterior mediastinum compressing and displacing the left anonymous vein. There was also some pulmonary embolism due to the well-known thrombotic complication of the disease (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Interestingly, the mediastinal mass, that was initially strongly suspected of lymphoproliferative disease, disappeared after 2 months with the resolution of the SARS-CoV-2 without any specific therapy. It must therefore be considered as enormous mediastinal confluent lymphadenopathy (
