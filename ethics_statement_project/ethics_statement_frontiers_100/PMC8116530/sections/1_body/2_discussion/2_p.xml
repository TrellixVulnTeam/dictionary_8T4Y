<p>Ninjin'yoeito was administered to the two patients described herein to improve subjective symptoms, such as, loss of appetite and malaise. In addition to these improvements, trends for improvement were also observed with respect to respiratory function after 12 weeks of administration. Ninjin'yoeito is a Kampo prescription consisting of 12 crude drugs. Unlike hochuekkito and juzentaihoto, which are Kampo prescriptions that are similarly used to improve lassitude and malaise, ninjin'yoeito contains schisandra fruit, polygala root, and citrus unshiu peel, which all act on the respiratory system. A component of schisandra fruit, α-cubebenoate, has been reported to suppress accumulation of eosinophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes in the pulmonary alveoli in a bronchial asthma model and inhibited Th2 cytokine and TGF-β1 in pulmonary tissue (

We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because the findings showed that NYT can improve fatigue and contribute to maintaining quality of life in IP patients.
