<p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive disease in which advanced fibrogenesis results in irreversible honeycomb lungs. Antifibrotic agents can be used to treat IPF but the efficacy is limited. The mean lifespan after diagnosis of IPF is 3â€“5 years; and the mean lifespan after exacerbation of IPF is 2 months or less. IPF is associated with a very high mortality rate (

Accompanying the progression of restrictive ventilatory defect, the IPF patient may complain of subjective symptoms, such as, exertional dyspnea, dry cough, weight loss, malaise, and/or fatigability. Since these symptoms significantly reduce patients' quality of life, we decided to administer ninjin'yoeito as an available medicine for malaise under universal health coverage in Japan. This report describes the administration of ninjin'yoeito to 2 IPF patients who had experienced loss of appetite and malaise, and a clear therapeutic response was observed.
