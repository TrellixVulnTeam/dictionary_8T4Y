In Case 1, improvements were observed in appetite, lassitude, and breathlessness, as well as increases or increasing tendencies in body weight, blood albumin level, and hemoglobin (Hb) level. Case 2 showed no changes in appetite but improvements in lassitude and no deterioration of breathlessness. His body weight and his blood albumin and Hb levels increased or showed increasing trends. In both cases, a trend for improvement of respiratory function was observed. In summary, ninjin'yoeito trended to improve the subjective symptoms and nutritional status of a patient with pulmonary fibrosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</kwd><kwd>loss of appetite</kwd><kwd>malaise</kwd><kwd>ninjin'yoeito</kwd><kwd>Kampo medicine</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="15"/><page-count count="4"/><word-count count="2427"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive disease in which advanced fibrogenesis results in irreversible honeycomb lungs. Antifibrotic agents can be used to treat IPF but the efficacy is limited. The mean lifespan after diagnosis of IPF is 3&#x02013;5 years; and the mean lifespan after exacerbation of IPF is 2 months or less. IPF is associated with a very high mortality rate (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Accompanying the progression of restrictive ventilatory defect, the IPF patient may complain of subjective symptoms, such as, exertional dyspnea, dry cough, weight loss, malaise, and/or fatigability. Since these symptoms significantly reduce patients' quality of life, we decided to administer ninjin'yoeito as an available medicine for malaise under universal health coverage in Japan. This report describes the administration of ninjin'yoeito to 2 IPF patients who had experienced loss of appetite and malaise, and a clear therapeutic response was observed.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Case Report</title><p>Case 1 was a 59-year-old male with a history of rhabodomyolysis. The patient was referred to our hospital because of gradually progressive dyspnea on exertion. His height was 155.5 cm, the body weight was 51.8 kg and the percentage of oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 95%. His respiratory test results are shown in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Chest computed tomography (CT) demonstrated subpleural fibrotic opacities with traction bronchiectasis in the upper and lower lung fields. He was clinically diagnosed as IPF with pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis-like lesions based on the guidelines (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). He was treated with nintedanib ethanesulfonate and 7.5 g (divided into two doses) of ninjin'yoeito. The appetite score [Simplified Nutritional Appetite Questionnaire, SNAQ (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)] showed improvement, increasing from 15 before administration to 16 after both 4 and 12 weeks of administration (SNAQ consists of four items related to appetite. All questions are scored from 1 to 5 points, with a total score ranging from 4 to 20 points. The lower the score, the poorer the appetite). Similarly, the lassitude score [Chalder Fatigue Scale, CFS (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)] improved from six before administration to four after 4 and 12 weeks of administration (CFS consists of 11 items related to physical and mental fatigue. All questions are scored from 0 to 3 points, with a total score from 0 to 33 points. The higher the score, the stronger the fatigue). The breathlessness score [Modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale, mMRC (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)] also improved from two before administration to one after both 4 and 12 weeks of administration (mMRC scale uses a 5-grade scale, with Grade 0 representing almost no breathlessness and Grade 4 representing severely impaired activities of daily living due to breathlessness. The higher the grade, the stronger the breathlessness). Body weight increased from 51.8 kg before administration to 54.5 and 55.2 kg after 4 and 12 weeks of administration, respectively. The blood albumin level increased from 3.6 g/dL before administration to 4.5 g/dL after both 4 and 12 weeks of administration, and the Hb level showed an increasing trend, changing from 14.9 g/dL before administration to 15.6 and 15.4 g/dL after 4 and 12 weeks of administration, respectively. The CONUT scores were zero before and 12 weeks after ninjin'yoeito administration. A trend for improvement was also observed with respect to respiratory function test results. Serum KL-6 decreased from 499 to 481 U/ml. LDH increased from 162 to 181 IU/L (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). There was no occurrence of transaminitis during the treatment. He had an increase in walking distance from 383 to 440 m in a 6-min walk test (6MWT) 12 weeks after administration. The value of the lowest SpO2 at 6MWT remained unchanged at ~90% for 12 weeks. The CT finding did not show significant changes before and after treatment with ninjin'yoeito.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The results of pulmonary function tests and biomarkers before and after ninjin'yoeito treatment in Case 1.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Before</bold></th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>After 12 weeks of</bold></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>administration</bold></th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>administration</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Vital capacity (VC) (L)</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.18</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.45</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">%Vital capacity (%VC)</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.2</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">72.5</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Forced vital capacity (FVC) (L)</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.14</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.42</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Forced expiratory volume 1.0 (FEV1) (L)</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.86</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.02</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Forced expiratory volume 1.0% (FEV1%)</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">86.9</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">83.5</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">KL-6 (U/ml)</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">499</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">481</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LDH (IU/L)</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">162</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">181</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Chest radiograph and CT scans of Case 1 showing elevation of bilateral hilar opacities and subpleural reticular opacities in the bilateral lung fields.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnut-08-548076-g0001"/></fig><p>Case 2, a 59-year-old male was referred to our hospital for respiratory failure and was clinically diagnosed as IPF based on the guidelines [Raghu et al.

The treatment improved subjective symptoms such as, loss of appetite, malaise, and breathlessness, as well as scores related to nutritional status, including body weight and blood albumin and Hb levels. In a basic pharmacological study using a bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis model, ninjin'yoeito was reported to have suppressed decreases in food intake and body weight, atrophy of the gastrocnemius, and expression of inflammatory cytokines in the lungs (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Regarding the mechanism by which it improves loss of appetite, activation of ghrelin-responsive, and unresponsive neuropeptide Y neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and actions mediated by dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) have been reported.</p><p>Ninjin'yoeito was administered to the two patients described herein to improve subjective symptoms, such as, loss of appetite and malaise. In addition to these improvements, trends for improvement were also observed with respect to respiratory function after 12 weeks of administration. Ninjin'yoeito is a Kampo prescription consisting of 12 crude drugs. Unlike hochuekkito and juzentaihoto, which are Kampo prescriptions that are similarly used to improve lassitude and malaise, ninjin'yoeito contains schisandra fruit, polygala root, and citrus unshiu peel, which all act on the respiratory system. A component of schisandra fruit, &#x003b1;-cubebenoate, has been reported to suppress accumulation of eosinophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes in the pulmonary alveoli in a bronchial asthma model and inhibited Th2 cytokine and TGF-&#x003b2;1 in pulmonary tissue (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In a pneumonitis model, ninjin'yoeito was shown to suppress lung injury and death as well as production of nitric oxide in the serum (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Pirfenidone is a therapeutic agent for IPF and has been shown to have an antifibrotic action in models of pulmonary fibrosis and hepatic cirrhosis (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Similarly, in a hepatic fibrogenesis model, ninjin'yoeito was found to suppress increases in the hepatic levels of hydroxyproline, which is an index of total collagen, as well as the production of cytokines that induce fibrogenesis (TGF-&#x003b2;1 and IL-13) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Investigation of additional cases will help to clarify the effect of ninjin'yoeito for the treatment of respiratory diseases. We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because the findings showed that NYT can improve fatigue and contribute to maintaining quality of life in IP patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s4"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Fukuoka University Hospital Ethics Committee.
