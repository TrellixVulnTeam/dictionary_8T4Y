<p>In this retrospective analysis, data were collected from the hospital's in-house computer system. The primary outcome parameter was post-operative high-output ileostomy. All planned and unplanned operations were included. The following variables were used to assess perioperative characteristics: age, body mass index (BMI), gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, diagnosis, secondary diagnoses, immunosuppressant medication, nicotine abuse, surgical procedure and technique, type of ileostomy, length of surgery. Nicotine abuse: since data about pack years were unreliable, smokers were divided into active smokers (nicotine abuse within 1 month prior to the operation) and non-smokers (no or former nicotine abuse). Post-operative outcomes are reported with these variables: complication rate (classified by Clavien-Dindo), HOS, mortality during inpatient stay.</p>
