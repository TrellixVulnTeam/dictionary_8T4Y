<p>A known cause for development of a HOS is the length of the remaining sections of the small intestine. In addition to high electrolyte losses, a negative fluid and caloric balance may be observed in patients with a jejunum that remains &lt;100 cm orally from the stoma (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In ileostomy, the pure length of the remaining ileum with preserved jejunum was not described as a risk factor for the development of HOS. There is evidence that post-operative gastrointestinal infections, e.g., Clostridium difficile enteritis, a partial or intermittent post-operative obstruction of the intestinal lumen, sudden post-operative discontinuation of existing medication with glucocorticoids or opioids, use of prokinetics or a relapse of an existing underlying disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, radiation enteritis) can contribute to HOS (

With regard to the choloresorptive function of the terminal ileum, chologenic diarrhea in bile acid malabsorption syndrome was discussed as a trigger for increased stool frequency after an ileostomy, especially if &lt;50 cm of the terminal ileum was resected. In this case, the malabsorption of bile acids clearly outweighs that of water (

The higher intraluminal content of bile acids can contribute to the development of watery diarrhea in the ileum through an osmotic, active secretory, and cytotoxic effect. This effect probably correlates with the length of the resected terminal ileum. From a resection size of about 100 cm terminal ileum, the increased excretion of bile acids also outweighs the compensation capacity of liver synthesis and the bile acid pool is exhausted. The latter can also lead to severe diarrhea and steatorrhea by reducing the absorption of free fatty acids and thus water (
