<p>Temporary or permanent ileostomies are used in a variety of diseases, e.g., in the operative therapy of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) or in colorectal cancer. In the post-operative course, several complications can occur which are related to an ileostomy. In addition to local complications such as retraction or prolapse of the stoma, dermatitis and erythema, leakage, or obstruction, a high-output stoma (HOS) can develop (

As a result, dehydration, electrolyte shift, acute kidney failure, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and even death may occur (
