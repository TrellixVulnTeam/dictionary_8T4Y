<p>There is a wide range of definitions for HOS in the literature. Most authors refer to the cumulative stoma output within 24 h as a diagnostic criterion. Previous literature refers to different stoma output values such as &gt;1,500 mL per day (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), &gt;2,000 mL per day (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), at least once &gt;2,000 mL/day, but &gt;1,000 mL/day for at least 3 days (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) or 2,000 mL/day for at least 3 days (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).
