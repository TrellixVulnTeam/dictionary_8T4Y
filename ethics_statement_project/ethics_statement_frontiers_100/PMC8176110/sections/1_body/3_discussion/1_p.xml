<p>The high-output ileostomy is one of the complications after ileostomy and can result in longer and repeated hospital stays and a reduced quality of life for the patient. Perioperative risk factors for developing HOS have not yet been adequately studied. In this study, we were able to identify age, diagnosis (Crohn's disease) and surgical procedure (right-sided colectomy, separate ileostomy, small bowel resection) as significant risk factors.</p>
