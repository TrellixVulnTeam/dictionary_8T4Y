<p>The incidence of high-output ileostomy was 13.9% in our study. Only a few studies concentrated on ileostomies for the development of HOS and the incidences for HOS were often significantly higher. Takeda et al. found an incidence of 23.8% in their collective of 164 patients with colorectal cancer (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Baker et al. reported an incidence of 16%, but they did not differentiate between the ileostomy and jejunostomy (&gt;200 cm or &lt;200 cm small intestine orally of the stoma) (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The occurrence of HOS was inversely correlated to the length of the small intestine proximate to the stoma in the former study, i.e., shorter bowel correlated with higher incidence of HOS. Since we specifically analyzed ileostomies, studies that did not distinguish between ileostomy and jejunostomy or included colostomies were difficult to compare with our work. In contrast to other studies, we did not limit the diagnosis that led to ileostomy formation to certain diseases but included all IBD patients as well as carcinoma patients and patients with other diagnoses. In the work of Hara et al. from 2020, 81.2% of the patients had colorectal cancer and the incidence of HOS was 31% (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). A Dutch study by Bakx et al. showed an incidence of HOS of only 4.3% in 69 patients. However, only temporary ileostomies were included here, and patients with anastomotic leakage and patients with inflammatory bowel diseases were excluded (
