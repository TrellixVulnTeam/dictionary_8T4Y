<p>Older patient age was already included in risk analyses of previous works on HOS. However, there are no uniform results, since some studies also describe younger age as a risk factor for HOS (

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In contrast to our work, only patients with colorectal cancer were examined in the aforementioned studies. In line with our results, Justiniano et al. also showed that older age correlated significantly with a higher rate of re-hospitalization due to dehydration regardless of the surgical diagnosis (

The present work makes an important contribution to the discussion insofar as a high number of cases was included and no pre-selection of certain subgroups was carried out.
