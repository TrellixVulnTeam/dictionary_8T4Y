<p>Another approach to the development of HOS after resection of the terminal ileum results from the observation of the neuropeptide metabolism. Above all, neuropeptide YY (PYY), released in the terminal ileum, has an appetite-reducing effect by inhibiting gastrointestinal motility and stimulating electrolyte secretion (

Postprandial feedback is eliminated, intestinal hypermotility and hypersecretion of electrolytes occur. The role of PYY has already been discussed in the pathogenesis of patients with short bowel syndrome (
