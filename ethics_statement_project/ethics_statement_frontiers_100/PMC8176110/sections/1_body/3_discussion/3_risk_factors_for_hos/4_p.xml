<p>The type of surgery was identified as another risk factor for HOS in our work. In particular, right-sided colectomies (including Ileocecal resections), (procto-) colectomies and isolated ileum segment resections, which were usually associated with a protective ileostomy or an anastomotic stoma, were identified as factors. It is known that shortening the small intestine with the placement of a more proximal ileostomy can lead to HOS (

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). This is based on a disturbance in intestinal permeability that can occur after abdominal surgery (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Here, cytokines such as TNF-Î±, which are released in the event of tissue damage, play a central role. In IBD, a disturbance in intestinal permeability is already pathognomonic in the early stages of the disease (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). If there is an intestinal resection, tissue damage increases and an increased cytokine cascade with increased disruption of the intestinal barrier resulting in HOS, is conceivable.
