<p>The surgical diagnosis was another risk factor for the development of a HOS in our study. CD patients developed a HOS significantly more often than patients with ulcerative colitis or colorectal cancer. The majority of previously published studies focused on patients with colorectal cancer. To date, there is little knowledge available to compare the variety of diseases leading to surgery and their role as potential independent risk factors for HOS. It is known from case reports that HOS occurs in patients with CD (

In our work, we excluded patients with jejunostomies and only examined ileostomies. A possible reason for the higher rate of HOS in CD is the resection of parts of the ileum that is frequently necessary. CD is associated with a disturbance in the intestinal permeability or barrier. Reduced tight junction proteins lead to increased cellular permeability even when there is no macroscopic lesion of the intestinal mucosa (
