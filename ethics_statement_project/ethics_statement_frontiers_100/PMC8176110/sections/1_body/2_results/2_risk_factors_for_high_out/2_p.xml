<p>Regarding surgical procedures, small bowel resection was associated with HOS more often than any other operation (43.5%,

 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). After ileo-pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA), right colectomy, and sole ileostomy, patients developed HOS more often compared to left colectomy. Patients with open surgery showed more HOS compared to minimally invasive procedures (20 vs. 6.9%, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.002). After emergency cases, HOS was significantly more common than after elective surgery (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.014). Patients with an anastomotic stoma showed more HOS than patients with loop or end ileostomy (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Length of surgery and post-operative morbidity had no influence on HOS.
