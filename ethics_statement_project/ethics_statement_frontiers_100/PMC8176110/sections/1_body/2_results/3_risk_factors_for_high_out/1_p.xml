<p>All significant variables from the univariate analysis were included in the multivariable logistic regression model (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The development of HOS was independently associated with older age. Patients with Crohn's disease were at higher risk for HOS compared to patients with ulcerative colitis or patients with carcinoma or other diagnoses. Furthermore, the kind of surgical procedure was associated with HOS. Especially right-sides colectomies including ileo pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA), and ileocoecal resection as well as sole ileostomy and small bowel resections were at higher risk for HOS.
