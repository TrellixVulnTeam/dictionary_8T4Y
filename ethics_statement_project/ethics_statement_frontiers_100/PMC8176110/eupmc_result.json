Unfortunately, some patients develop a high-output stoma (HOS). This condition affects homeostasis and may be life threatening. We aimed to identify possible risk factors for the development of HOS. <b>Patients and methods:</b> From 2012 to 2018, 296 patients who underwent ileostomy at Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin were retrospectively analyzed. Emergency operations were included. Diverting ileostomy, end ileostomies and anastomotic stomata with at least part ileum, were examined. HOS was defined as stoma output of more than 1,000 mL per day for more than 3 days. Univariate and multivariable analyses were used to detect potential risk factors for the development of HOS. <b>Results:</b> 41 of 296 patients developed HOS (13.9%). Mortality was 0.3%.
