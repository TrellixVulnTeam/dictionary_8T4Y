<p>We collected information from patients who underwent epilepsy surgery between February 2019 and February 2021, as the first half of this period between February 2019 and January 2020 was pre-pandemic and the second half between February 2020 and February 2021 was just within the pandemic period in Japan. Patient age was recorded at the time of depression scale evaluation.</p>
