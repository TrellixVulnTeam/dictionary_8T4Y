<p>The SDS test is a 20-item self-reported questionnaire in common use as a screening tool, covering affective, psychological, and somatic symptoms associated with depression. The questionnaire takes 5â€“10 min to complete, and items are framed in terms of positive and negative statements. The total score is derived as the sum of scores for the individual item scores, ranging from 20 to 80. Patients who undergo epilepsy surgery in our institution undergo SDS before the surgery. We divided the enrolled patients into two groups: those who underwent surgery in the first half of the period, categorized as during the pre-pandemic period group between February 2019 and January 2020 (pre-Group); and those who underwent surgery in the second half of the period, categorized as during the pandemic period between February 2020 and February 2021 (within-Group). We compared SDS scores between these two groups.</p>
