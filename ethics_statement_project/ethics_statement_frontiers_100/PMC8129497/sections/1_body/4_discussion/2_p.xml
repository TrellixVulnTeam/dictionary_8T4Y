<p>Rayner and Wilson (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) reported that a less compromised psychiatric profile may contribute to better outcomes of epilepsy surgery. Even though we did not provide special treatments for psychiatric comorbidities for enrolled PWE, the fact that PWE with a less negative outlook underwent epilepsy surgery during the pandemic in this study might partially support this theory by Rayner and Wilson. Given the disaster-preparedness measures taken by our facility, the continuity plan might have worked. As Japan experiences relatively frequent disasters, such as earthquakes, typhoons, and floods, many facilities in Japan might prepare for such disruptive events. The other effort was that as our local interdisciplinary system for epilepsy treatment became established (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), the flow cycle for PWE among local general physicians and our epilepsy center was able to be maintained. Based on these approaches to the calamity that might be decreasing psychological stresses among surgical candidates, thereby improving such negative situations for PWE, epileptologists might not hesitate to perform epilepsy surgery even during a pandemic.
