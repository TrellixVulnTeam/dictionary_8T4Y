<p>As interventions in medical treatments, including for epilepsy, have a certain order of priority (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), some PWE might be classified as having non-urgent disorders (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), despite they might have severe conditions such as COVID-19-related status epilepticus (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). However, using advanced technologies such as telemetry (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), home-video recordings (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and tele-neuropsychology tests (
