<p>Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common skin cancer of the hand. However, SCC associated with DD has been rarely reported. Haslik et al. (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) reported a case of SCC in the presence of DD in the language of German. Alberico et al. (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) reported another case of SCC in the presence of Ledderhose disease. Ledderhose disease is considered to share a spectrum with DD and 10% of the patients of DD can be found with Ledderhose disease (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first case in the English literature of SCC on the palm of a patients with DD.
