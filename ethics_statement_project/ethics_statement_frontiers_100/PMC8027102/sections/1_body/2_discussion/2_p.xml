<p>Cutaneous SCC is the most common primary malignancy of the hand. It has an increasing annual incidence, accounting for 20 to 30% of cutaneous malignancies (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and 58 to 90% of all hand tumors (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). It is almost always located on the dorsum of the hand, with very rare occurrence on theÂ palm (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Only a few case reports of SCC on the palm have been published (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The ulcer on the palm of our patient was finally diagnosed with cutaneous SCC. However, it still needs to be differentiated from trauma, pyoderma, fungal or mycobacterium infection.
