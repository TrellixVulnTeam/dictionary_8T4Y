<p>DD is considered a benign but debilitating disease due to the decreased range of motion and grip strength. Dysregulation of certain genes may affect the growth characteristics of fibroblasts in palmar aponeurosis, leading to gradual differentiation into myofibroblasts and excessive production of type III collagen (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, it is believed that the prevalence of skin tumors may be underestimated and not adequately documented. A recent retrospective study of 181 DD patients showed that the risk of NMSC in DD patients was twice that of the controls (
