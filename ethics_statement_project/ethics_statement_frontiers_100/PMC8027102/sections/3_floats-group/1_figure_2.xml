  <p>Histopathology of the hand lesion. HE staining of the tissue (panel 
   <bold>A</bold> was from the edge of the ulcer, panel 
   <bold>B</bold> was from the ulcer) revealed atypical squamous cell proliferation and horn pearls in the dermis (H&amp;E×100, ×10). Immunohistochemical staining of the biopsy specimen showed 
   <bold>(C, D)</bold> the squamous cells were positive for pan cytokeratin and negative for vimentin (×100).
