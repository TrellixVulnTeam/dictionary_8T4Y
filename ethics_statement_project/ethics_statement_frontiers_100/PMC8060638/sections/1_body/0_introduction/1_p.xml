<p>McKeown esophagectomy is the primary surgical procedure for esophageal malignancies. As RGEA is the primary source of blood supply of the gastric conduit (

Notably, in recent years, there have been rare reports on the exploration of intraoperative reconstruction of RGEA and RGEV. Moreover, the key surgical techniques during the vascular reconstruction and cervical anastomosis with gastric conduit has not been fully revealed in McKeown esophagectomy. In the past decade, a total of 843 patients received esophagectomy in our department, among whom 3 (0.36%) underwent vascular reconstruction in McKeown esophagectomy. All the three patients had good prognosis. One elderly patient with emphysema suffered from mild anastomotic leakage and respiratory failure after operation. The anastomotic leakage was cured after 2 weeks of conservative treatment (
