<p>The short-term ischemia reperfusion process can help the gastric conduit adapt to the transient hypoxia environment, which may lower the risk of postoperative anastomotic leakage (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, the venous injury may cause severe gastric conduit congestion and even microcirculation thrombosis, which can seriously affect the healing of the anastomosis and impede the blood reperfusion after vascular reconstruction, resulting in postoperative anastomotic fistula possibly. Therefore, we recommend a vein-first principle of vascular anastomosis.
