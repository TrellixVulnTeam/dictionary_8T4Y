<p>Based on the literature review and clinical experience, we would like to underscore 2 points of the surgical techniques in McKeown esophagectomy, in which reconstruction of RGEA and RGEV and cervical anastomosis using gastric conduit were performed simultaneously: (1) Immediate reconstruction of the RGEA and RGEV and long-term maintenance of the blood flow effectively. (2) Effective tension reduction of gastric conduit anastomosis and vascular anastomosis.</p>
