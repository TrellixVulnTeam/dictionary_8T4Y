<p>Hitherto, there have been no convincing reports that revealed the feasibility and safety to reconstruct RGEA and RGEV and to perform cervical anastomosis using gastric conduit simultaneously. Given that a previous study introduced the cases on whom RGEA reconstruction was performed in Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), the present study provided a novel perspective for thoracic surgeons who might intraoperatively injured the RGEA in the McKeown esophagectomy. In the present study, 2 patients received reconstruction of RGEA and RGEV in the vein-first order, as both the RGEA and RGEV were injury during the operation. While, another patient received reconstruction of RGEA, as only the RGEA was injury during the operation. The vascular reconstruction and cervical anastomosis using gastric conduit were performed simultaneously in all patients without severe postoperative complication. And no patient died in 6 months after surgery.
