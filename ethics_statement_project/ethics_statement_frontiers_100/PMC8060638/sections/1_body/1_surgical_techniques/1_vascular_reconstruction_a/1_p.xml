<p>A midline incision was made in the epigastrium to ensure adequate relaxation of the gastric tissues and immediate exploration of the injured vessels. If the vascular deficit is small, the soft tissues around the vascular stumps should be fully dissociated, and then the tension of the vascular stumps should be accurately assessed. Once acceptable tension was identified at the vascular stumps, the injured vessels could be reconstructed via direct anastomosis promptly.</p>
