<p>One strength of the current study is the large sample size (
 <italic>N</italic> = 137). Many studies in the field of motor learning include relatively small sample sizes. For example, meta-analysis of 
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Logan et al. (2012)</xref> on motor skill interventions in children reported sample sizes of 12â€“42 participants per study. Similarly, meta-analysis of 
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Lebeau et al. (2016)</xref> on Quiet Eye and performance reported sample sizes of up to 50 participants per study. Depending on the methodology used, these relatively small sample sizes can lead to low statistical power. In contrast, using an online platform can allow researchers to reach more participants with relative ease, thus enabling them to conduct studies with ample statistical power.
