<p>In such an online study, we are not able to know at the outset if participants who begin the study will decide to withdraw before completing it. Therefore, we recruited 140 participants to ensure that we would have the required sample size of 120 participants. Most of the participants completed the study, and we ended up with a sample size of 137 participants between the ages of 18 and 35 years. Using automatic, simple computerized randomization, the software allocated participants to three experimental groups: (a) an external focus group (
 <italic>n</italic> = 44), (b) an internal focus group (
 <italic>n</italic> = 46), and (c) a control group (no attentional instructions; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 47). The inequality in the number of participants in each group is due to the automatic randomization process, which sometimes fails to account for participants who began their participation but withdrew before completing the study. All the participants filled out an electronic informed consent form prior to participation, and the study was approved by the ethics committee of the Academic College at Wingate (approval # 279).
