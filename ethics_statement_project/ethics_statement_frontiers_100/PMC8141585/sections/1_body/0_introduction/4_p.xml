<p>Although the abovementioned studies examined the effects of different attentional foci on RT, only a small number of studies examined the specific effects of external and internal focus of attention (as more recently defined) on the performance of simple tasks or on RT. For example, 
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Porter and Anton (2011)</xref> showed that older adults undergoing chemotherapy performed a rotary pursuit task better when using external focus instructions compared with internal focus instructions or no instructions. 
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Raisbeck et al. (2020)</xref> found benefits for external focus of attention in a reciprocal aiming task with two levels of difficulty. In addition, 
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Ille et al. (2013)</xref> reported faster sprint start RTs under external focus conditions compared with internal focus conditions in both novices and experts. In contrast, 
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Gottwald et al. (2019</xref>; Exp. 1) reported that, compared to external focus of attention, using internal focus of attention led to more accurate movements in a computer-based aiming movement task. Finally, 
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Zimmermann et al. (2012)</xref> examined neural correlates of attentional focus in a Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanner and found neural modulation when changing from external to internal focus or vice versa. However, there were no behavioral differences in a finger tapping task.
