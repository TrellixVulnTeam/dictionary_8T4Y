<p>Despite the abundance of studies that support the beneficial effects of external focus of attention on performance and learning, some studies show that this may not always be the case. For example, 
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Perkins-Ceccato et al. (2003)</xref> showed that external focus of attention benefited highly skilled golfers, but that internal focus of attention benefited low-skilled golfers. In another study (
 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Wulf, 2008</xref>), acrobats performed better in a balancing task under a control condition compared to both external and internal instruction conditions. Finally, 
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Rienhoff et al. (2015)</xref> found that an external focus of attention led to reduced basketball free-throw shooting performance and to sub-optimal gaze behavior in novice, advanced, and expert female basketball players.
