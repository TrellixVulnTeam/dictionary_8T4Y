<p>In conclusion, the results of the current study show that attentional focus instructions do not affect the performance of a simple choice-RT task or of a Simon-task in a computerized online study. Online studies can help achieve adequate statistical power, and can prevent bias caused by the lack of blinding. We encourage researchers to complement their laboratory-based research with online research.</p>
