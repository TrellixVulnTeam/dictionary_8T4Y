<p>Measurement scales for all constructs in this study were designed based on previous studies and were scored on a seven-point Likert scale, with higher scores indicating higher agreement with the question. Behavioral intention, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control were adapted from 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Ajzen (1991)</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Paul et al. (2016)</xref>, and 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Yadav and Pathak (2016)</xref>. Perceived usefulness with three items was adopted from 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. (2013)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al. (2015)</xref>. Curiosity and joy with three items, respectively, were modified from 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Agarwal and Karahanna (2000)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Lowry et al. (2012)</xref>. Social recognition with three scales was developed from 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et al. (2010)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">McPhail et al. (2011)</xref>. Finally, environmental ethics had three items adopted from 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Henriques and Sadorsky (1999)</xref>. Before the formal questionnaire was sent out, a pilot test was conducted in order to revise the content of the questionnaire to avoid any discrepancies. Therefore, the content validity of this research could be improved, eliminating the occurrence of ambiguous words and inappropriate questioning through the pilot test.
