<p>By using the maximum likelihood method, this study performed structural model testing to estimate the hypothesized relationships of the proposed model. Model fit indicators determine the degree of whether the sample data fit the structural equation model. 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Schumacker and Lomax (2010)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Kline (2011)</xref> recommended a variety of criteria to determine the model fit of a structural model. 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al. (2009)</xref> suggested that the commonly used model fit reporting guidelines are
