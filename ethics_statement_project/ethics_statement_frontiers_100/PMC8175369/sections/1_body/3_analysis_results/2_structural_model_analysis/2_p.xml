 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> demonstrates several model fit indicators and the thresholds recommended by previous studies. Except for 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>, all model fit indicators exceed the recommended levels suggested by 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Schumacker and Lomax (2010)</xref>. Because 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> is very sensitive to a large sample, the ratio of 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> to its degree of freedom was computed. For a good model fit, the ideal ratio should be below three. Instead of evaluating each index independently, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Hu and Bentler (1999)</xref> proposed that more strict combination rules should be applied to model fit indices so the type I errors could be controlled. The model fit indicators satisfy most of the independent level of recommended fits and the combination rule. Thus, it has been proven that the proposed model of most of the constructs has a good fit.
