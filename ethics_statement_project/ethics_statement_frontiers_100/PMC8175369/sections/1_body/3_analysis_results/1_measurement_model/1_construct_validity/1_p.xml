<p>This study followed the two-step approach of structural equation modeling (SEM) proposed by 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Anderson and Gerbing (1988)</xref> to estimate the measurement and structural model. We chose SEM as the statistical method and AMOS as the analysis tool for two reasons. First, SEM is a family of statistical procedures that could handle the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and path analysis. Particularly, CFA is an important procedure to measure construct validity and the path analysis is adopted to evaluate the research hypotheses (

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Babin et al., 2008</xref>). The first step examined construct reliability and validity of the measurement model using CFA, and the second step checked the path effects and their significance of the structural model. The measurement model was assessed by using the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) in terms of factor loadings, reliability of measurement, convergent validity, and discriminant validity.
