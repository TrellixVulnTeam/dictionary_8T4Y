<p>In order to exclude disease as a confounder to our height estimates, such as chronic illness, or congenital disorders, we confirmed that none of the âˆ¼3,000 samples included in our study have aneuploidy. Of note, the offspring included in the study cohort aged between 40 and 49, so that the growth would have been completed while the height loss due to aging would still be negligible.</p>
