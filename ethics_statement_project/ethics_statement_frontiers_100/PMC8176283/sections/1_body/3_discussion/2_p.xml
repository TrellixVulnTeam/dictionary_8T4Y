<p>There are a few limitations of this study. First, the sample size is small as the United Kingdom Biobank only contained approximately âˆ¼1,000 informative trios. Second, the structure of the pedigree is simple. While we only examined height in trio structure, ideally, it might significantly increase model power if we could identify families with data from both parents and multiple offspring, especially those pedigrees where siblings have significantly different height. Third, given that height at childhood is prognostic for height at adulthood ref. (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Wit and Oostdijk, 2011</xref>), the model accuracy may be improved by incorporating height at childhood, but we did not have access to those data. Other variables to consider for future study include status of certain diseases and lifestyle factors such as nutrition and exercise, or biomarker measurements such as growth hormone levels. Fourth, some studies adjust the phenotype for age and gender prior to the prediction analysis rather than including them as predictors. Their idea is that phenotype prediction is to see how well a phenotype can be predicted for people in the same age, gender and ancestral group. Therefore, the R2 reported in our study would not be directly comparable to such studies because our study did include age and gender as predictors.
