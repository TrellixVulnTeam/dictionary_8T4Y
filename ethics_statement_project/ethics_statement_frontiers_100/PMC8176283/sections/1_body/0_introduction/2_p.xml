<p>A major limitation of the genomics studies above is the absence of parental height in the prediction model. In this study, we use trio data from two flagship population cohorts, the United Kingdom Biobank (UKB) Prospective cohort and the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), to evaluate the predictive power of conventional predictors (based on height of parents and gender of proband) and polygenic risk score (PRS). We aim to identify a more accurate method for the prediction of height.</p>
