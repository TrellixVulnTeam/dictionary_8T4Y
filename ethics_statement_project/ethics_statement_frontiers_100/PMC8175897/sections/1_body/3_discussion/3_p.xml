<p>Regarding the size of the thyroid and the second operation, it is believed that the increase in the size of the thyroid and the difficulty of neck anatomy will cause the reduction of the surgical field and the difficulty of identifying and protecting the parathyroid glands (

In univariate analysis, operation time was related to transient postoperative parathyroid hypoplasia, but it was excluded in multivariate analysis. It should be explained that the difficulty of the operation played a leading role, leading to prolonged operation time.
