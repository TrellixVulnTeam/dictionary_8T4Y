<p>Malignant thyroid tumors often require lymph node dissection. Related literature also shows that lymph node dissection in the central group can significantly increase the direct damage to the parathyroid glands or blood supply disorders during the operation (

Some scholars believe that preventive dissection does not significantly reduce the probability of recurrence and metastasis and increases the risk of parathyroid injury. This case study suggests that combined lymph node dissection is a risk factor for transient and long-term hypoparathyroidism, which is similar to the results of some studies at home and abroad (

Therefore, to reduce the damage to the parathyroid glands during lymph node dissection, it is necessary to perform lymph node dissection under the premise of standardized protection of the parathyroid glands and use nano carbon or other color reagents to color the parathyroid glands (
