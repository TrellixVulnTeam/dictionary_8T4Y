<p>Hypoparathyroidism is one of the most common complications after thyroid surgery. Surgery affects the parathyroid glands' blood supply, and direct damage to the parathyroid glands or miscut during the operation are the most common causes. In this study, the incidence of transient hypoparathyroidism was 36.1%, and the incidence of hypoparathyroidism was 3.9% after 6 months of follow-up. In 537 patients undergoing bilateral total thyroidectomy, the following conclusions were obtained after multivariate logistic regression analysis: gender, combined lymphatic dissection, operation duration, maximum thyroid diameter, preoperative blood calcium, and transient hypoparathyroidism are related, Combined with lymphatic dissection, maximum thyroid diameter, and d1PTH are associated with long-term hypoparathyroidism.</p>
