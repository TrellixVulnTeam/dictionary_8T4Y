<p>Preoperative blood calcium is the baseline of the patient's blood calcium level. This study used blood calcium (more objective) and PTH laboratory test indicators to determine hypoparathyroidism. In order to rule out some subjective factors, the main complaint of patients-related hypocalcemia symptoms was not used. Therefore, the preoperative blood calcium index has a direct effect on whether the postoperative calcium is low. But this study also found that it does not correlate with long-term postoperative parathyroid hypoplasia. D1PTH impacts long-term hypoparathyroidism, and it can be used as a predictor of long-term hypoparathyroidism. For patients whose d1PTH is less than normal, calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation should be strengthened. If failing to get enough calcium supplements or close follow-up review, the patient may miss the chance of parathyroid function recovery.</p>
