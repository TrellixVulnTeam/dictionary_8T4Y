<p>Hypoparathyroidism after bilateral total thyroidectomy is common, and most of them are transient. Gender, combined lymphatic dissection, maximum thyroid diameter, a second surgery, and preoperative blood calcium are the risk factors for transient hypoparathyroidism after thyroid surgery. A small number of transient hypoparathyroidisms turned into long-term hypoparathyroidism. The combination of lymphatic dissection and the largest thyroid diameter were risk factors for long-term hypoparathyroidism after surgery. The d1PTH was lower than Normal has a predictive effect on patients with long-term hypoparathyroidism.</p>
