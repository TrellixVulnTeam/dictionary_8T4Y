<p>Beh√ßet disease (BD) is characterized by recurrent oral aphthous ulcers and other systemic manifestations. BD is believed to be an autoimmune and vasculitic disorder. BD affects the veins more frequently than the arteries (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The vascular inflammation causes a significant venous thrombotic tendency. The lower extremity venous thrombosis is most frequent, but other veins, including cerebral venous sinus, can also be affected. The cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) was reported to occur in about 20% of neuro-BD (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Huge dilemma exists in the treatment of CVST with BD. Here, we report a BD case with refractory intracranial hypertension caused by CVST which is successfully treated with catheter-directed endovascular thrombolysis. Before endovascular thrombolysis, intravenous pulse methylprednisolone combined with anticoagulant therapy was used, and resulted in limited effects.
