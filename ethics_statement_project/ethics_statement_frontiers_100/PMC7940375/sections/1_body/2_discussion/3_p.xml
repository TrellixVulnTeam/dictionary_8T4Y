<p>Systemic anticoagulation (LWMH or heparin) is the mainstay treatment of CVST. However, about 9â€“13% of the CVST patients have poor outcome despite the anticoagulation therapy (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The factors associated with severe CVST include coma, thrombosis of the deep cerebral venous system, central nervous system infection, and cancer, etc (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The urgent relief of the cerebral venous hypertension is very important for the patients who deteriorate despite anticoagulation therapy. While the endovascular intervention is not the first line therapy, it has been used as salvage treatment for severe CVST which is refractory to anticoagulation therapy (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In CVST with BD, it is reported that although 85.7% (18 patients) of the patients achieved remission with the treatment of glucocorticoid, immunosuppressant therapy and anticoagulants, 14.3% (3 patients) required systemic thrombolytic treatment (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In a systematic review of CVST with BD, sequelae were present in 20% of the patients. Optic nerve atrophy and blindness were the predominant sequel (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). It is reported that thrombolysis therapy was useful in deep venous thrombosis (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), pericarditis (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) with BD, and thrombolysis therapy was also tried in Budd-Chiari syndrome with BD (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In this case, we also report a refractory CVST with BD was treated successfully with catheter-directed endovascular thrombolysis. Before thrombolysis therapy, we excluded the pulmonary and cerebral aneurysms. There was no major hemorrhage in our case.
