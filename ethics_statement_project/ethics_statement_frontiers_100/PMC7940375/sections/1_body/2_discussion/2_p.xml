<p>Huge dilemma exists in the treatment of CVST with BD. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) agreed that high dose glucocorticoids should be used for acute CVST. No data shows the benefit of adding immunosuppressants in the acute CVST, and immunosuppressants may also be unnecessary for the relapses of the CVST with BD. Anticoagulants may be added, but only for a short time (
