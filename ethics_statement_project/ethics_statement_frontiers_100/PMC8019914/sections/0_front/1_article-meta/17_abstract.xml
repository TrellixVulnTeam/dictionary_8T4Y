 <p>Pulmonary clear cell sarcoma is a rare malignant tumor that has rarely been reported and is challenging to diagnose, especially when differentiating from malignant melanoma. Currently, EWSR1-ATF1 is the key marker for distinguishing clear cell sarcoma from melanoma, but IHC has diagnostic limitations. We report a patient diagnosed with pulmonary clear cell sarcoma, in which an NGS was used to help with the pathological diagnosis. The exposure to the immune microenvironment in pulmonary clear cell sarcoma suggests that TIGIT-related drugs may be a new and effective treatment for this rare disease. Immune microenvironment-related markers, including PD-L1, CD8, TIM3, LAG3, and CD163, were negatively expressed in pulmonary clear cell sarcoma.</p>
