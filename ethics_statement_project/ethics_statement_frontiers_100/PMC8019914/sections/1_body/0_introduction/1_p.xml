<p>Enzinger first described a rare soft tissue tumor of clear cell sarcoma (CCS) in 1965 that arose from the abnormal differentiation of pigment cells (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), previously known as soft tissue malignant melanoma. CCS cases account for approximately 1% of rare tumors originating from stromal cells (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). CCS is most common in young men and women between the ages of 20 and 40 years. CCS usually arises on the distal extremities, especially on the tendons and aponeurosis of the foot and ankle and on the arms, hands, and trunk, as reported by Goh et al. (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). At present, EWSR1-ATF1 is used as a key marker to distinguish melanoma from CCS (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). This disease has a slow course, and the average age of CCS diagnosis is 39 years. According to Gonzaga et al., at diagnosis, CCS is usually advanced and locally aggressive, with a high rate of recurrence and metastasis (up to 50%). The most common site of distant metastases is the lung; the overall 5- and 10-year survival rates are approximately 50 and 38%, respectively, with no significant differences in survival rates between males and females (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Although surgical treatment may be beneficial for the patient, new molecular targeted therapy should be implemented to improve the oncologic outcome in early- and late-stage disease (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Hence, we report a patient with pulmonary CCS, in which NGS was used to help with the diagnosis and explore molecular characteristics of genes and the immune microenvironment of pulmonary CCS in this patient.
