<p>In summary, pulmonary CCS is a rare soft tissue malignant tumor that occurs in young adults and has rarely been reported. In our study, a new NGS technique was used to help pathologically diagnose PCCS, thereby improving the diagnostic strategy, especially the differential diagnosis between CCS and malignant melanoma. Exploring the molecular characteristics of genes and the immune microenvironment of pulmonary CCS will be an essential for the clinical treatment of this rare disease</p>
