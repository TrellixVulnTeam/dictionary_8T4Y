<p>Several predictors of work restoration among employees with mood and/or anxiety disorders have been examined by past studies. With respect to work participation, Lagerveld et al. (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) performed a systematic review focusing on depression and found strong evidence for the association between a long duration of depressive episodes and work disability. Moderate evidence was found for the associations of work disability with more severe types of depressive disorder, presence of comorbid mental or physical disorders, older age, and a history of previous sick leave. With respect to work functioning, severe depressive symptoms were associated with work limitations, and clinical improvement was related to work productivity (moderate evidence) (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) found strong evidence for the association of older age (&gt;50 years) with continuing disability and longer time to return to work (RTW); limited evidence for the association of other personal factors (gender, education, history of previous sickness absence, negative recovery expectation, socio-economic status), health-related factors (stress-related and shoulder/back pain, depression/anxiety disorders), and job-related factors (unemployment, quality and continuity of occupational care, supervisor behavior) with disability and RTW; and limited evidence for the association of personal/external factors (education, sole breadwinner, partial/full RTW, changing work tasks) with symptom recovery.
