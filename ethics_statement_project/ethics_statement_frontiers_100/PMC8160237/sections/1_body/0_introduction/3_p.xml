<p>To date, it has not been investigated whether the frequency of participation in an RTW program is associated with successful work restoration and maintenance of restoration. It seems plausible that more frequent RTW program participation would entail more success in work restoration and maintenance. On the other hand, the duration of participation in an RTW program might be affected arbitrarily by the circumstances of individual companies to which each patient would be restored. For example, some workers may take relatively longer sick leave days whereas other workers can take relatively shorter sick leave days due to the rules of individual companies. Rather, the frequency is, to some extent, free from the circumstances of individual companies because for example one can try to participate in an RTW program 5 days per week for 4 weeks which is equal to a participation of 2 days per week for 10 weeks in the frequency of 20 if the upper limitation of sick leave days is 4 weeks. Thus, in the present study, we attempted to investigate the hypothesis that the frequency of RTW program participation is positively associated with successful work restoration and maintenance.</p>
