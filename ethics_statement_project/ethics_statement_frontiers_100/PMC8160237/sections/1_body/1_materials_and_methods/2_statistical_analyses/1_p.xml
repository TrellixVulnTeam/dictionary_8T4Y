<p>The association between the frequency of RTW program participation and work restoration was compared between patients who could be restored to their jobs (restoration group) and those who could not be restored (non-restoration group) using a 
 <italic>t</italic>-test (crude model). Next, a binary logistic regression analysis was performed using restoration or non-restoration as a dependent factor, and age, gender, frequency of RTW program participation, program (old or new), and total work experience (years) as independent factors (adjusted model).
