<p>The restoration group had a significantly higher frequency of RTW program participation than the non-restoration group (72.1 ± 42.1 vs. 44.0 ± 26.1 times; 
 <italic>t</italic> = 3.1, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The range of the duration of RTW participation was 8 to 318 days and the mean was 134.1 days and SD was 67.4 days. The binary logistic regression analysis with forced entry showed the significance of the model (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 12.594, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.027) and that the frequency of RTW program participation was significantly associated with restoration (more frequency, more restoration), but not with the other factors (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Particularly, whether the RTW program was old or new was not associated with the outcome. In addition, we performed another binary logistic regression analysis with forward stepwise selection method to decrease the number of independent factors for only 77 patients, showing the significance of the model (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 9.915, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.007) with only two independent factors (the frequency of RTW program participation and total work experience) and that the frequency of RTW program participation was significantly associated with restoration (odds ratio = 0.977, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.021; more frequency, more restoration), but not with total work experience (odds ratio = 1.084, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.062). This result was in agreement with that of forced entry with five independent factors.
