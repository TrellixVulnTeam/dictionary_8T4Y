<p>The present findings show that the frequency of RTW program participation is positively associated with work restoration but not with maintenance of restoration. This is in partial agreement (restoration) and partial disagreement (maintenance of restoration) with our hypothesis. It is possible that the effects of the RTW program disappeared over time. Interestingly, maintenance of restoration was significantly associated with gender (significantly better among men than women). It seems possible that when confronting difficulties in maintaining work restoration, female workers may be prone to discontinuing their jobs than male workers, but this should be clarified in future research.</p>
