<p>Several reports have shown predictive factors for maintenance of restoration. Hori et al. (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) reported that worse social adaptation self-evaluation scale (SASS) scores, worse 3-back correct response rate, and more benzodiazepine dosage were associated with further episodes of sick leave. Atake et al. (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) reported that successful restoration (with a year of restoration maintenance) was predicted by an SASS score more than or equal to 31, a correct response rate more than or equal to 50% in the 3-back task, and a diazepam equivalent benzodiazepine dosage â‰¤ 7.5 mg at the time of deciding on restoration. In addition, Morita et al. (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) showed that &lt;2 h of activity outside of the home predicted further sick leave. Further studies should investigate whether various such predictors can correctly predict maintenance of restoration.
