<p>Sproken et al. (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) identified five distinct RTW trajectories, namely (a) fast RTW with little chance of relapse, (b) slow RTW with little chance of relapse, (c) fast RTW with considerable chance of relapse, (d) slow RTW with considerable chance of relapse, and (e) very fast RTW with a very small chance of relapse. Stress complaints and adjustment disorders were more prevalent in the faster trajectories, while depression and burnout were more prevalent in the slower trajectories. Furthermore, older employees, women, and non-profit sector employees showed longer trajectories. Although our study did not pursue such trajectories, our findings of less restoration in female workers may be in line with their findings of faster restoration dampening female restoration requiring slower-pace restoration.
