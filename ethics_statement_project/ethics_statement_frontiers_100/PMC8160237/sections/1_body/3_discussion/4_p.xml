<p>The limitations of this study are the relatively small sample size and that the RTW location was a private hospital, which might preclude generalization. Moreover, there were some other confounding factors that might be associated with work restoration and maintenance, such as differences in psychiatric diagnosis and severity of the disorders. Owing to the nature of a retrospective observational study, it was difficult to clarify the causal relationship between RTW program and work restoration and maintenance. Although the RTW program in this hospital seems to be average in Japan, it cannot be denied that the RTW program and/or the participants and/or the staffs were deviated and the present findings were also deviated. Moreover, various workers from several companies participated in the RTW program which provided various tasks for several duration. That is, the present findings derived from heterogenous situation. Moreover, honestly speaking, it is unknown whether the present findings are reconfirmed or not and it cannot be completely denied that there is a bell-shaped dose relationship where optimal frequency exists and less or more than the optimal frequency is not good for restoration. Further studies are required to resolve these problems.</p>
