<p>The patient found the nasal-root mass 5 years ago. The mass was the size of a peanut, soft, of normal skin color and with a swollen smooth surface, often exhibiting self-absorption with no other discomfort. In October 2018, nasal mass resection was performed at a local hospital and postoperative pathology was unclear. A relapse occurred in January 2019 and the mass gradually increased in size over the next 10 months, to approximately the size of 5 cm Ã— 2.5 cm. The patient came to our department for a clear diagnosis and treatment.</p>
