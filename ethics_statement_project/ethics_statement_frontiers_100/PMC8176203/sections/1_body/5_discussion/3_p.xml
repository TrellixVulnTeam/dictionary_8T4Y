<p>In the past, Kimura's disease was sometimes confused with ALHE (angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia). ALHE occurs predominantly in the skin, as opposed to Kimura's disease, which occurs as a subcutaneous lesion. Both are characterized by heavy eosinophilic infiltration, vascular proliferation and a predilection for appearing in the head and neck region. Conspicuous features of Kimura's disease on histopathology include hyperplastic lymphoid follicles with prominent germinal centers and eosinophilic infiltration. Laboratory tests show that eosinophils on routine blood testing and IgE in serum are significantly increased in patients with Kimura's disease (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Sometimes, Kimura's disease can occur in other organs, especially the kidneys, where it takes the form of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The eosinophils on routine blood testing and IgE in serum are significantly increased, and the diagnosis of Kimura's disease is certified without ALHE.
