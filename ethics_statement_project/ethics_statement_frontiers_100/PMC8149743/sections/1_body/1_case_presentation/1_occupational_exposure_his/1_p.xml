<p>A male patient born in February 1950 began work with the X-ray inspection of metal parts in 1974. In the middle of the night on December 1978, he slept at the back of the X-ray flaw detector without knowing that his colleague had started up the industrial flaw detector compartment in the operating room. The exposure time was about 30 min. After the accident site simulation, the physical dose was estimated using LiF thermoluminescence dosimeter. When exposed to light from the 2005 X-ray flaw detector produced by Shanghai Flaw Detector Factory, with a maximum capacity of 7.5 kVA, the working voltage of the normal flaw detection operation was 160 kV. The average absorbed dose rate was 0.87 Gy/min at 0 m away from the probe window (close to the probe mirror); the absorbed dose of his back skin measured by the thermoluminescence dosimeter was 26.0 Gy. The dose-effect estimation curve of chromosome aberration (
