<p>According to the current Standard for the Judgment of Occupational Radiation Tumors (GBZ 97-2017) (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), this case of malignant tumor has been included in the list of malignant tumors calculated in Table B.1 in Appendix B to calculate the probability of etiology. According to the patient's gender, the systemic absorbed dose of acute X-ray radiation at age 28 years was 1.78 Gy. After 34 years (62 years old), considering the diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia and other data, the calculated PC (Probability of causation) value of the cause of cancer was 81%. The PC 95% upper limit was 200.88%, the adjusted PC' 95% upper limit was 144.93%, and the calculated 95% credible upper limit of etiology probability was &gt; 50%, which can be judged as occupational radiation tumor.
