<p>The patient's white blood cells decreased to 1.5 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L, 20 days after exposure and fluctuated between (1.5 and 2.4) × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L for 18 months. Thus, the patient was hospitalized 19 months after exposure and treated with drugs to improve the leukocyte count, which increased to (4.2–5.4) × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L. Follow-up observation showed that the white blood cells remained at the normal level. The patient's early bone marrow smear examination showed granulocyte maturation disorder but normal hematopoietic function was restored after 2 years. Eighteen months after exposure, chromosomal aberration analysis of 600 cells in the patient showed 31 double centromeres, 5 translocations, 5 centromeres, 13 pairs of microsomes, and 13 pairs of fragments, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. In the detection of chromosome aberration in peripheral blood lymphocytes, the rate of chromosome aberration at 18 months, 5, 10, 20, and 34 years after exposure was 7.3, 5.5, 0.5, 0.5, and 0%, respectively. The semen examination of the patient showed that his sperm count was 0 within 18 months after the irradiation, and sexual desire completely disappeared; at the 24th month, his sperm count was 0–1/ml; and after 26 months, his sperm count returned to the normal level, and sexual desire resumed, as shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In the same year, his wife became pregnant and gave birth to a normal baby girl. Follow-up observation showed that the baby girl developed well.
