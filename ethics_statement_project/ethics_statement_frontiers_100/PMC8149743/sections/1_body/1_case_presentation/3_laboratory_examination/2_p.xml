<p>Leukemia diagnostic test was performed and the results of blood routine showed that white blood cells (7.0 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L), hemoglobin (75 g/L), platelets (10 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L), and abnormal cells were 60%. Furthermore, bone marrow examination showed abnormal proliferation of proto-lymphocytes (89%) and positive extracellular iron staining, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. The immune types of leukemia were CD7
 <sup>+</sup>, CD13
 <sup>+</sup>, CD33
 <sup>+</sup>, CD34
 <sup>+</sup>, CD38
 <sup>+</sup>, CD45
 <sup>+</sup>, and CD117
 <sup>+</sup>. The original T-lymphocyte population accounted for 81.13% of non-erythroid. No abnormality was found in the karyotype analysis of bone marrow cells. Qualitative tests for the c-KIT/D816V gene mutation, CEBPA gene mutation, and fusion gene screening were all negative. No obvious abnormalities were found in biochemical indexes, tumor markers, B-mode ultrasound, and CT (Computed Tomography) examination.
