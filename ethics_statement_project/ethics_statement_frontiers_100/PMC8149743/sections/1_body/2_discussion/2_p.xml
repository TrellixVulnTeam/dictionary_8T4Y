<p>Although radiation does not play a prominent role in the etiology of all human cancers like chemical carcinogens, but since nuclear technology is more and more widely used in human production and life, the potential harm of radiation to humans is also increasing (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The proportion of radioactive tumor in occupational radiation disease is increasing year by year. Due to the high incidence of radiation-induced leukemia and a long incubation period, it is receiving increasing attention (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Radiation-induced leukemia was first reported in Japan. The leukemia started about 2 years after the exposure and reached its peak 6â€“8 years after the exposure. Among the various types of leukemia induced, acute granulocytes, lymphocytic leukemia, and chronic myelogenous leukemia were the major ones (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). This case was caused by uneven radiation of the whole body, resulting in local radioactive skin damage of grade IV with mild bone marrow acute radiation sickness. In our case, acute lymphocytic leukemia was diagnosed 34 years after the exposure. To calculate the cause of cancer caused by the previous exposure, the upper limit of 95% confidence limit of PC after correction was 144.93%.
