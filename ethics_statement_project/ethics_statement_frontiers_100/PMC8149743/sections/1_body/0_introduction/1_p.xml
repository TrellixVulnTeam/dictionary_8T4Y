<p>Application of ionizing radiation to an organism can produce biological effects of radiation on the organism (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The mechanism of action can be divided into stochastic effect and deterministic effect, also called organizational response. Stochastic effects include cancers in exposed individuals due to somatic cell mutations and genetic effects in offspring due to germ cell mutations. Ionizing radiation induces malignant tumors, which has been confirmed in a large number of animal experiments and human epidemiological studies (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, the genetic effect induced by ionizing radiation is still lacking epidemiological evidence, and such effect has only been found in animal experiments (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Leukopenia, cataracts, erythema depilation, and other radiation skin damages caused by ionizing radiation are all deterministic effects. In 1978, an X-ray inspection worker in Zhejiang Province, China, was accidentally exposed to an uneven systemic irradiation, resulting in acute radiation disease of the bone marrow combined with local acute radiation skin injury. Thirty-four years after the accident, the patient died of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The case is reported as follows.
