The sequence of the generated random number will be inserted into envelopes sealed by an independent researcher (SA), not participating in the main data collection phase or in the intervention. These envelopes will be opened only after the participants sign the informed consent and complete all baseline assessments (FK). Then, the eligible participants will be randomly divided into two groups, a usual care group and an intervention group, which uses the application.
