<p>Psychological assessment will be conducted using the DASS-21 questionnaire, as the primary outcome. This questionnaire (21 items) is primarily designed to test emotional states such as depression, anxiety, and stress with three respective subscales each with 7 items. The instrument is known for appropriate psychometric properties and is widely employed. A validated version of the questionnaire in Persian language (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) will be used in the present study with three subscales as the main indicators of the negative emotional and psychological responses. A 4-point Likert scale will be used to test the emotional state of each subscale in the questionnaire. The scale ranges from 0 (does not apply to me at all) to 3 (applied to me very much, or most of the time). As for the total score of each subscale, it ranges from 0 to 21, and a higher score represents a higher level of depression, anxiety, and stress. According to Asghari et al. (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), Cronbach's Alpha test of internal consistency was estimated at 0.94 for the whole scale and 0.85, 0.85, and 0.87, respectively, for depression, anxiety, and stress subscales. Moreover, the intra-class correlation with an absolute agreement between Time 1 and Time 2 assessment occasions for depression, anxiety and stress scales were found to be 0.77 (95% CI: 0.56–0.88), 0.89 (95% CI: 0.81–0.94), and 0.85 (95% CI: 051–0.94), respectively. Intra-class correlation values above 0.74 represent a good reliability (
