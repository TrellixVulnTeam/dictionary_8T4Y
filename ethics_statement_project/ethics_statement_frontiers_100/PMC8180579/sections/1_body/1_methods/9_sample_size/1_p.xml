In the above-mentioned research, after the intervention, the effect size between the control and intervention group (the one provided with the application) was reported to be 0.41. The sample size is estimated 190 in total (95 for the intervention group and 95 for the control group) which is calculated in G
 <sup>*</sup>Power software with an effect size of 0.41, error probability of 0.05, power of 0.8, and allocation ratio of 1:1. Regarding the 10 % attrition rate within the study, the goal is to include 105 patients in each group (210 participants overall).
