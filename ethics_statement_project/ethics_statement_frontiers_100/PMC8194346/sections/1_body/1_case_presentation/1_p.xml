 <italic>via</italic> laparoscope surgery on 29 November 2016. She had no history of kidney disease nor any family history of cancer. Pathology revealed a nuclear grade 2 clear cell carcinoma (TNM-staging: pT2 pN0 G2 M0) with favorable prognostic features according to MSKCC criteria, and thus the patient underwent a regular comprehensive review after surgery. Right middle femur metastasis occurred in January 2018, and positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) showed multiple lung metastases on 5 February 2018. At this time, she experienced low fever, poor appetite, and fatigue. Physical examination of lungs showed clear breath sounds, no weakening and no rales. She began therapy with sunitinib, and zoledronic acid, 4 mg every 4 weeks. During sunitinib treatment, a grade 2 hand-foot skin reaction occurred. After a 2-month treatment, a CT showed that the lung metastasis had increased in size, which was evaluated as progressive disease according to
