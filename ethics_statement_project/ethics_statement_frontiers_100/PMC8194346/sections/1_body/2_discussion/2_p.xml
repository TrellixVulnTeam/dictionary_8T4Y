<p>CIK cells are a group of heterogeneous immune-active host effector cells created from peripheral blood lymphocytes that are stimulated by interleukin-2 (IL-2), anti-CD3 antibodies, and interleukin-1 (IL-1) 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. CIK cells express the dual-functionality of acquiring NK cell function and retaining TCR-mediated cytotoxicity with T cell subsets (

One possible mechanism is be that anti-PD-1 therapy increases the number of effector T cells in the tumor microenvironment, and CIK cells, essentially T lymphocytes, have a direct cytotoxic effect against tumor cells (
