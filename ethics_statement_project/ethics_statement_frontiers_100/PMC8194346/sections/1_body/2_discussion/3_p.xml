<p>Pseudoprogression is a special phenomenon that occurs during immunotherapy. It is defined as the presence of a new lesion or an increase in size of an existing lesion, followed by a decrease in the tumor burden. It thus appears to be disease progression until the next imaging assessment. Biopsies have confirmed it is essentially an influx of inflammatory cells, necrosis, or sarcoid-like reactions. The overall incidence of pseudoprogression in solid tumors is low. If pseudoprogression occurs and the patient is clinically stable, according to iRECIST, the patient can continue treatment. However, some patients may consider changing treatment options for fear they have true disease progression. Thus, distinguishing between true progression and pseudoprogression is especially important. iRECIST criteria are currently the definitive guidelines for measuring objective response rates in cancer immunotherapy trials. According to iRECIST, waiting for 4-8 weeks until the next imaging assessment should occur before changing treatment (

In our case, when lung lesions progressed for the first time and new lesions appeared in the brain, without deterioration in clinical symptoms, we did not change the treatment plan. Subsequent imaging examination confirmed that the change was pseudoprogression. However, patients with true disease progression will have delayed potentially effective treatment. Studies suggest changes in serum interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels and circulating tumor DNA may be useful in the diagnosis of pseudoprogression (
