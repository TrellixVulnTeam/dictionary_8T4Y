<p>This study has several limitations. Foremost, it was designed as a retrospective observational study. The data were collected from the prospectively maintained databases with good integrity, which is favorable for propensity matching analysis. However, several factors that can influence survival did not reach complete matching, due to the relatively small size of the whole population. Furthermore, the distribution of SCT regimen was not well balanced (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.407). The proportion of patients receiving GC in the HAI group was relatively higher (51.6 
 <italic>vs.</italic> 37.1%). Although the Cox model analysis confirmed that HAI significantly reduced the risk of death after adjustment for confounding factors including SCT regimen, the limitation of no definite SCT regimen should not be ignored.
