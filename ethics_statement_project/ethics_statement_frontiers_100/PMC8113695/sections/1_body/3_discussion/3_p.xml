<p>Nowadays, GEM/nab-paclitaxel and FOLFIRINOX are preferred regimens for patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. A randomized phase III study on GEM plus nab-paclitaxel showed that the ORR was 23% in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In addition, the ORR varied from 15 to 30% in patients treated with other recommended regimens, for example, GEM monotherapy, GC and GEMOX, in previous studies (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). As listed above, the efficacy of SCT for advanced pancreatic cancer is still unsatisfactory. In the present study, most patients (87.1% in non-HAI group and 93.5% in HAI group) received GEM-based dual-drug combinations. In the non-HAI group, the ORR was 25.8%. This result was consistent with published data on modern SCT. In the HAI group, the extrahepatic ORR was similar to that of the non-HAI group, suggesting HAI with low-dose of FUDR does not help to improve extrahepatic response.
