<p>In the last decade, HAI was repositioned as part of a comprehensive treatment for advanced liver tumors (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), and administrated in combination with standard systemic therapy. In this study, we showed that HAI FUDR in combination with SCT was associated with an improvement in survival in patients with PCLM. The median OS was 14.0 months for patients treated with HAI as compared with 10.8 months for patients without HAI after propensity score matching (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.008). Although the extrahepatic ORR was similar, the intrahepatic ORR was significantly higher in the HAI group (66.1 
 <italic>vs</italic> 25.8%,
