<p>From 2012 to 2019, consecutive histologically confirmed PCLM patients who received first-line chemotherapy were included from prospectively maintained databases in two Chinese centers (Xiangya Hospital, Central South University; the Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University). Patients with metachronous metastasis were included if the interval between the occurrence of liver metastasis and the end of adjuvant chemotherapy is more than 6 months. Patients who received concurrent radiotherapy were excluded. The cohort was divided into two groups according to whether the patients received HAI FUDR therapy. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Xiangya Hospital and the Ethics Committee of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University.</p>
