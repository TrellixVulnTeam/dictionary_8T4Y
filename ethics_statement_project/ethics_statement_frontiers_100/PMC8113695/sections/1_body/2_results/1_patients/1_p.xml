<p>From 2012 to 2019, 347 patients with PDLM received first-line chemotherapy in Xiangya Hospital of Central South University and the Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University. Among them, 28 patients who had underwent chemoradiotherapy were excluded from this study. In addition, 61 patients (including 26 with obstructive jaundice and 35 with peritoneal carcinomatosis at baseline) receiving SCT alone were excluded for there were no matched patients in the HAI group. Finally, 258 patients (62 patients with HAI and 196 without HAI) were included.

  <bold>Table 1</bold>
 </xref> lists the comparisons of baseline characteristics between the HAI and non-HAI groups. In the whole population, there were significant differences in number of liver lesion, EHM, and CA19-9 level between the two groups. In the HAI group, patients who had liver lesions &gt;10 and/or CA19-9 &gt;800 ng/ml were significantly more than those in the unmatched non-HAI group. In contrast, more patients had EHM in the unmatched non-HAI group. After 1:1 ratio matching, 62 patients per group were included. The two groups were well matched in terms of age, gender, PS score, time to liver metastasis, and EHM. However, observed but not statistically significant difference existed in the number of liver lesion (

 <italic>P</italic> = 0.151).
