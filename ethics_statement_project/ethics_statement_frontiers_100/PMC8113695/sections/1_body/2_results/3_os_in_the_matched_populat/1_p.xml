<p>By the end of follow-up, 57 patients (91.9%) in the HAI group and 60 patients (95.2%) in the non-HAI group died. The 1- and 2-year survival rate was 71.0 and 24.2% in the HAI group and 46.8 and 9.7% in the non-HAI group, respectively. Median OS was 14.0 months (95% CI: 12.5–15.5) for patients treated with HAI and 10.8 months (95% CI: 8.7–12.9) for patients without HAI. OS for patients with HAI was better than patients without HAI (
