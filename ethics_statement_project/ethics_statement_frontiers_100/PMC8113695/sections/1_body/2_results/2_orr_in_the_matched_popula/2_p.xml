<p>Thirty-six patients (58.1%) in the HAI group and 39 patients (62.9%) in the non-HAI group underwent second-line SCT (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.714). In the HAI group, HAI was continuously administrated for median four cycles (range 2–7) in combination with second-line SCT in 17 patients who developed extrahepatic disease progression but had disease control in the liver. In addition, eight patients received HAI (median four cycles, range 2–6) in second-line treatment in the non-HAI group.
