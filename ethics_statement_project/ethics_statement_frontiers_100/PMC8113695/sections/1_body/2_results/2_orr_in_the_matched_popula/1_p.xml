  <bold>Table 2</bold>
 </xref> lists the objective response in intrahepatic and extrahepatic lesions separately. For intrahepatic lesions, five CR (8.1%) and 36 PR (58.1%) were observed in patients treated with HAI. The intrahepatic ORR was 66.1% in the HAI group, which was significantly higher than 22.6% (0 CR and 14 PR) in the non-HAI group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.001). In the HAI group, 44 patients had evaluable extrahepatic lesions (including intact primary tumor and extrahepatic metastasis) and 11 patients (25.0%) achieved PR. In the non-HAI group the extrahepatic ORR was 28.9% (13/45). There was no significant difference in extrahepatic ORR (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.679).
