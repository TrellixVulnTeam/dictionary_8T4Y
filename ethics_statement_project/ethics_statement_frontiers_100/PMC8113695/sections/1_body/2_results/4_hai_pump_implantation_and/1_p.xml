<p>The HAI pump system was implanted successfully in all 70 patients (including eight patients who received HAI in a second-line treatment). Four patients (5.7%) discontinued HAI due to dysfunction of HAI pump. Catheter occlusion occurred in one patient after three cycles of HAI therapy. One patient had hepatic artery occlusion at 11 months. Two patients developed local abscess at the pump implant site, and the pumps were removed at 4 and 7 months. It should be noted that these two patients had insulin-resistant diabetes. No patient discontinued HAI due to liver injury caused by FUDR.</p>
