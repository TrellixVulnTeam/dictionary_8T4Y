<p>The study has some limitations. First, the sample of the students is relatively small, and further studies should be conducted on larger samples of persons with developmental disabilities. Second, the baseline level of depression and anxiety symptoms before the pandemic occurred was not assessed in our study, thus, there is a possibility that there are other factors, except the pandemic-related difficulties, which influence the results. Third, the exact IQ scores for all the participants could not be obtained due to the pandemic situation. In future similar studies IQ scores should be included in regression analyses. Finally, we tested the participants only once, soon after the lockdown began. In future studies it seems important to assess emotional symptoms several times since it is possible that symptoms of depression and anxiety may relate to the amount of time spent in lockdown and may change in respect of further experienced inconveniences.</p>
