Although in our study we were not able to verify whether the severity of the symptoms has changed compared to the period before the lockdown, the increase in the symptoms of anxiety and depression in persons with developmental disabilities should be expected in situations of school closures, limitations in trade, services, and mobility, and other troublesome restrictions. Therefore, we recommend conducting screening assessments for symptoms of anxiety and depression that are carried out similarly to those described in this paper; we also recommend the provision of psychological and psychiatric support to persons with intellectual disability and other vulnerable groups.
