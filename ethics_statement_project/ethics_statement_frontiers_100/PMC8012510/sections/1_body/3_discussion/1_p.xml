<p>In our study, we aimed to investigate the symptoms of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 lockdown in students with developmental disabilities, the majority of whom have been diagnosed with mild intellectual disability. We also interviewed the students' parents or caregivers about the difficulties experienced by the members of their household in the last two weeks. The most-often reported difficulties included trouble with accessing the internet and a household member's loss of employment or opportunity to work. However, it is also worth noting that almost one-fourth of participants' household members reported they experienced the onset of an illness or worsening of their health condition. These results indicate the strong negative influence of COVID-19 lockdown on the health of family members and the financial situation of households of persons with developmental disabilities.</p>
