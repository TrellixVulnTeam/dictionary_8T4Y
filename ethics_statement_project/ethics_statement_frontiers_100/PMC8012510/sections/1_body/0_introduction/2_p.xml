<p>The study presented in this article aimed to investigate the symptoms of anxiety and depression in vocational school students with developmental disabilities who stayed home during the pandemic situation due to school closures. The studied group consisted of persons with developmental disabilities, the majority of whom had intellectual disabilities; this is a vulnerable group whose risk of psychopathology is ~4â€“5 times higher than in the general population (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), and three to four times higher for persons with intellectual disability (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The higher prevalence of mental health issues also applies to symptoms of anxiety and depression (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The sex differences in general population indicate that women are at significantly greater risk of anxiety and depression than men (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Findings related to persons with ID also suggest a higher prevalence of depression in girls (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and that girls with ID are significantly more fearful and experience more worry than boys (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).We assumed that the burden related to the pandemic situation may exacerbate emotional difficulties in this group. Similar assumptions in regard to general population were made and confirmed in a study conducted in Ireland during the pandemic (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The study allowed us to obtain information about these difficulties and to identify persons with developmental disabilities in need of psychological or psychiatric help.
