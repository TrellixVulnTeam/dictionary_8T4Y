<p>The study was conducted in Krakow in March and April 2020, after school closures due to the pandemic outbreak. We obtained the approval to conduct this research from the school board of a special education center for adolescents and young adults with intellectual disabilities. The data was gathered by two school psychologists who contacted the students and their parents or primary caregivers by phone. Before the pandemic, the psychologists were familiar with all the students they contacted. After giving consent, the parent or primary caregiver answered the questions regarding inconveniences experienced during lockdown, and the students answered questions included in GAD-7 and PHQ-8. When the participants reported that they had experienced symptoms of anxiety or depression, the psychologists conducting the interview offered them counseling and help in setting up a psychiatric consultation.</p>
