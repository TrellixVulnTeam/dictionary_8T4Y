Included in our study were 62 students with a diagnosis of mild intellectual disability, seven persons with a diagnosis of intellectual disability comorbid with a physical disability, and one with visual impairment.

The mild intellectual disability was diagnosed based on the ICD-10 (

 <italic>q</italic> = 0.75 showed that for error probability set as α = 0,05 and power set as 1-β = 0.8 the minimum required sample size was 62, when equal sizes of both subgroups were assumed.
