<p>Due to the skewness of the distributions of the total scores in GAD-7 and PHQ-8, the Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic>-test was used to examine the gender differences in the total scores in both scales with the rank-biserial correlation as a measure of the effect size. The moderated regression analyses based on the ordinary least squares linear model were performed to verify whether the impact of the pandemic-related inconveniencies on the total GAD-7 and PHQ-8 scores differed between girls and boys. The sum of these inconveniences, gender, and their interaction were specified as the predictors in the regression models. The dependent variables were transformed by taking the square root of their initial value to avoid the skewness of the distribution of the residuals in the regression models.
