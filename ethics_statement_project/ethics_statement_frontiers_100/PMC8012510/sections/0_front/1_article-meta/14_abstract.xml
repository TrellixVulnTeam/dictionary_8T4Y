  <bold>Background:</bold> In this study we aimed to assess symptoms of anxiety and depression in persons with developmental disabilities during COVID-19 lockdown.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Method:</bold> Soon after school closures related to the pandemic, we conducted telephone interviews with 64 vocational school students with developmental disabilities, the majority of whom had mild intellectual disability, and their parents. The parents were asked about stressful events experienced during lockdown. The students were assessed with screening measures for anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-8).
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Results:</bold> Over one third of the tested students reported mild or more severe symptoms of anxiety and depression, and girls were more affected than boys. The number of experienced lockdown inconveniences predicted the severity of depression symptoms in girls.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Discussion:</bold> The high prevalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression in persons with developmental disabilities indicates the need for screening studies and the provision of psychological help in situations such as the COVID-19 lockdown.
