<p>Microureteroscopy was performed using a MicroPerc set 4.85 F sheath (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). After approaching the ureteral meatus, microureteroscopy was accomplished without placing a safety guide or dilating the meatus in three procedures. The ureteroscopy began with a simple and virtually atraumatic passage through the meatus and intramural ureter. In one patient, high-pressure balloon dilatation was performed because pyeloureteral junction obstruction (PUJO) was observed during microureteroscopy. In this patient, microureteroscopy was performed with safety guide because of passage to renal pelvis was difficult by PUJO. So, it was performed using a hydrophilic guide to avoid damaging the pyeloureteral junction.
