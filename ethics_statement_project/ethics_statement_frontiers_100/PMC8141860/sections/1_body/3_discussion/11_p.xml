<p>The MicroPerc equipment has a higher initial cost than a conventional ureteroscopy.

Furthermore, in our case, the minimum requirement of auxiliary procedures (transient nephrostomy or JJ ureteral stenting) reduced the total cost of the procedure. We think that we will also have less associated morbidity (
