<p>Unlike pediatric ureteroscopes, the microperc sheat is not telescoped. This makes it possible not to obstruct the ureteral meatus when ascending to the renal pelvis, thus reducing the damage caused by renal hyperpressure. Although the image quality is worse than modern videoureteroscopes it is acceptable during lithotripsy. Irrigation serum was passed around the sheath, avoiding high pressure.</p>
