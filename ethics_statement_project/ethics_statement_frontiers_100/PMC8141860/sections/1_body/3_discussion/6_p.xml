<p>We placed double J in two procedures. In one of them, it was placed after pyelo-ureteral junction dilatation by high-pressure balloon due to associated PUJO. In the other case, the patient with bilateral lithiasis, the double J was placed during the first microureteroscopy due to our inexperience with this technique. He was our first patient treated with this approach. Furthermore, a new procedure under general anesthesia was not necessary that double J could be removed 2 months later during the contralateral microureteroscopy. However, we learned with this child that double J was not routinely necessary. We need larger series of patients to obtain more definitive conclusions on this matter.</p>
