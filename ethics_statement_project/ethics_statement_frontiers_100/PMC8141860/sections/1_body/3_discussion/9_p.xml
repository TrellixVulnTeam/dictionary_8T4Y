<p>Many authors use a safety guide during ureteroscopy. However, a safety guide was not usually used during our microureteroscopies. We did not used to place it to facilitate the access to the renal pelvis with the MicroPerc sheath. It was only used in one patient due to he presented PUJO that required high-pressure balloon dilatation. In this patient, the procedure was performed with hydrophilic guidance to avoid traumatizing the pyeloureteral junction. Obviously, we can use a safety guide if we consider it necessary in some patients without interfering with the procedure.</p>
