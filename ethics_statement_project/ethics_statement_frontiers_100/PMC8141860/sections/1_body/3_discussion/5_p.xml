<p>Retrograde endoscopic procedures may present the risk of ureteral injury and difficult access in young children, requiring preliminary double-J stenting to increase the compliance of the urinary tract. We usually perform ureteral meatus dilatation during conventional ureteroscopy in young children. This retrograde renal access showed several advantages than the usual one with an ureteroscope: we did not need dilatation of the ureteral meatus nor the use of a temporary pre-stenting with double J to achieve distension of ureter. In this way, we reduce morbidity associated with renal access (
