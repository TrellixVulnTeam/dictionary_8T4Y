 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> indicates the HR of incident dementia by bedtime and rise time reporting from the participants. Unadjusted HRs and 
 <bold>those from</bold> model 1 were 5.31 (95%CI 2.96–9.51) and 2.72 (95% CI 1.50–4.96). After adjustment for demographics, education, income, BMI, depressive symptoms, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, comorbidities, APOE4 genotype, and baseline MMSE, those with a bedtime of before 9 p.m. were almost three times more likely to develop dementia [HR=2.16 (95%CI: 1.06–4.40)], compared to those going to bed between 9 and 11 p.m. Later bedtime (i.e., after 11 p.m.) showed the opposite but had a non-significant association with dementia risk (unadjusted HR = 0.24, 95%CI 0.03–1.80; adjusted HR in model 1=0.24, 95% CI 0.03–1.81; adjusted HR in model 2 = 0.15, 95%CI: 0.02–1.29). The association slightly attenuated (adjusted HRs in model 3 were 2.00 (95%CI: 0.94–4.29) for earlier bedtime and 0.12 (95%CI: 0.01–1.05) for later bedtime) after further adjustment for sleep duration and efficiency. We did not find an association for rise time and risk of dementia.
