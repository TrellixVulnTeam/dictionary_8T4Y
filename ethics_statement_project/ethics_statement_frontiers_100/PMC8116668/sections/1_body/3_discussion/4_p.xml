<p>Strengths of the current study include a well-representative community-dwelling sample of the Chinese elderly, prospective follow-up for a relatively long period of time, detailed examination of cognitive function, and adjudicated diagnosis of dementia by experts. Our study cannot avoid the following limitations. First, sleep timing and quality were collected by the self-reported PSQI questionnaire, which could include recall bias. Second, even though we followed the participants for an of average 5 years, it may not be long enough to distinguish risk of dementia vs. an early marker of dementia. A longer follow-up can provide a solution for such reverse causality. Third, the relatively high lost-to-follow up rate with fewer incident dementia cases does not allow us to analyze the association with dementia subtypes. Fourth, there are still some potential confounding factors which could not be collected, but may impact the sleep-dementia association, although we tried to adjust covariables as much as possible in our multivariable statistical models.</p>
