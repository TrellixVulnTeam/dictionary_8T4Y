 <p>Central nervous system immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (CNS-IRIS) describes clinical characteristics that may be observed in previously immunocompromised patients during rapid restoration of immunity function in the presence of a pathogen. There have been no reports about CNS-IRIS related to bacterial meningitis so far. Here, we report a 24-year-old pregnant female patient with bacterial meningitis. Her clinical and neuroradiological condition worsened after induced labor despite great effective anti-infective therapy. CNS-IRIS was considered. Corticosteroids were administered, and the patient gradually recovered. We present the first case of CNS-IRIS associated with bacterial meningitis.</p>
