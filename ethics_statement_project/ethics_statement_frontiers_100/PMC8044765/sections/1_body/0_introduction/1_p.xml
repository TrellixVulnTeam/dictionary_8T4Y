<p>Infection of the central nervous system (CNS), usually presenting as meningitis or encephalitis, is linked to high mortality and morbidity rates throughout the world (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). During therapy of CNS infection, clinical deterioration may occur despite evidence of effective treatment. Known as CNS-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (CNS-IRIS), this paradoxical heightened immune response was initially identified in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients following anti-infection therapy and reversal of immune deficiency with antiretroviral therapy (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, it is increasingly found in immunocompromised hosts (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). CNS-IRIS occurs in 9%–47% of persons with HIV infection and CNS opportunistic infection who start antiretroviral therapy and has a mortality rate of 13%–75% (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). These rates vary depending on the causative pathogen. Most common CNS-IRIS events develop in relation to cryptococcus, tuberculosis (TB), and John Cunningham (JC) virus, but several other viruses, mycobacteria, and fungi have been associated with CNS-IRIS.
