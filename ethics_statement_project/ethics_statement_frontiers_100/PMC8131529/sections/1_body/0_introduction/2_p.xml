<p>Recently, a review of 150 group design intervention studies for young autistic children concluded that COIs are likely pervasive, but under-reported in this literature, despite the ubiquity of COI disclosure requirements (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bottema-Beutel et al., 2020</xref>). A limitation of this study is that it excluded single case designs (SCDs), which is the study design used by the majority of research into the effects of applied behavior analysis (ABA) interventions for autistic people (

It is important to explore COIs in this area of research because many autistic adults (including researchers and non-researchers) and non-autistic researchers have expressed serious ethical concerns about the provision of ABA to autistic people (

Autistic people are increasingly setting the agenda for autism research, and this includes critiques of intervention practices they may have received as children, or continue to receive into adulthood. Further, ABA interventions are routinely recommended by primary care providers in the United States to parents seeking support for their autistic children (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Zwaigenbaum et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Hyman et al., 2020</xref>), with more than 60% of autistic children in the receiving some form of behavioral intervention rooted in ABA philosophy (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). As such, it is important to determine if these recommendations are consistent with available literature and not unduly influenced by researcher bias.
