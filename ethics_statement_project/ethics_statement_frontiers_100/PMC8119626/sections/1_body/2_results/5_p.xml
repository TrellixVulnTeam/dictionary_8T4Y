<p>In 10 of the 11 DAT-positive cases, when either the placental sample or the heel stick sample were positive, maternal anti-A or anti-B antibodies coating newborns' red cells were responsible for the positive DAT result. In the one remaining case, both mother and infant had B positive blood type and the antibody screen of the mother's serum was negative. We hypothesize that non-specific IgG antibodies crossing the placenta from maternal circulation gave the positive DAT result in this case.</p>
