<p>Only 1 (1%) sample pair gave a discordant result. This occurred when the placental sample was positive for the presence of an antibody, while the heel stick sample was negative; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.999 for discordance. Interestingly, the positive antibody results were 1+ positive with both screening cells. In contrast, in the case of the discrepant result, only one of the screening cells gave a 1+ positive result with the placental sample.
