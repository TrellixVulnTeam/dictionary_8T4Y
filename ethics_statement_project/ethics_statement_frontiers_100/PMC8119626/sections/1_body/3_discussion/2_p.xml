In 2018, multiple publications were discussed comparing the placental venous blood to the infant's blood for complete blood count (CBC) and blood culture testing. Greer et al. concluded that placental venous blood is suitable for obtaining CBC and differential and it is also an appropriate second source for blood culture with appropriate placental surface cleaning techniques to avoid contamination (

Additionally, on day 1 of the Section on Neonatalâ€“Perinatal Medicine Program meeting at the American Academy of Pediatrics, placental venous blood usage was discussed for neonates being admitted to the NICU. It was concluded that placental venous blood was suitable for obtaining both a CBC and differential and as a second source for blood culture as it yields additional true pathogens (
