<p>The results of this study validated our hypothesis that placental blood samples are suitable for pre-transfusion testing and can replace heel stick samples to reduce blood sample collection from newborns. This study also validated the gel method for ABO and Rh typing of placental blood samples. Based on the results of this study, our blood bank accepts placental blood samples for pre-transfusion testing for term and twins infants. Future studies to further compare the placental blood to infant's blood are needed, especially when significant amount of blood is warranted for accurate testing. A few examples of these tests include screening for syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus, toxoplasmosis, and chromosomal microarray. This would result in our ultimate goal of minimum to no invasive blood draws during a newborn's hospital stay after delivery.</p>
