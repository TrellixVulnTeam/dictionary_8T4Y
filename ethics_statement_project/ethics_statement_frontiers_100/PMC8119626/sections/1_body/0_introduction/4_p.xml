<p>Our group, Aysola et al. (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), concluded in a recent publication in 2018 that the placenta can replace the infant's blood for pre-transfusion testing. In our study, premature infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) underwent comparison between paired placental blood and heel stick blood that resulted in 100% concordance in all pairs. Therefore, in our hospital, the placental blood was validated to be used for pre-transfusion testing using the gel and tube methods in infants &lt;35 weeks gestational age (GA) and &lt;2,000 g weight. However, this study excluded infants who were ≥2,000 g in weight and ≥35 weeks GA, and it also excluded twins.
