<p>In contribution to finding other ways to test infants accurately without the need to invasively collect blood from them, we conducted this study, which is the second phase of the previous study by Aysola et al. (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). This second-phase study aims to validate the placental blood for pre-transfusion testing for singleton and twin newborns ≥35 weeks GA and ≥2,000 g weight. It also aims to validate the tube and gel methodology for placental blood samples.
