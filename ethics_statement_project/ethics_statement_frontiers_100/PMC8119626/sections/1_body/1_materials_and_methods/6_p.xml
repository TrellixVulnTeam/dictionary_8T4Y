<p>We used anti-A, -B, and -D reagents from ALBAclone (Quotient Biodiagnostics, Newtown, PA, USA) to perform ABO and Rh typing in the tube. For the antibody screen, we used Selectogen I and II cells; the cell concentration in the tube was 3 ± 1%, while it was 0.8 ± 0.2% with gel technology. We used Ortho Antigram 0.8% Resolve Panel for antibody identification, while for DAT testing, we used anti-IgG (Rabbit). The screening cells for antibody screen and identification, as well as the ID-MTS gel cards, were all by Ortho Clinical Diagnostics. The technologist decided whether gel tests were done manually or by the automated instrument ProVue (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics).</p>
