<p>Infants who had parental consents had paired blood samples collected. These paired samples were placental samples collected within 30 min of birth, and heel stick samples collected during any time prior to the infant's discharge from the hospital. The heel stick collection for the sake of this study was done only in combination with other tests such as glucose and bilirubin, if needed, or the newborn screen. The blood samples collected from the placenta or from the infant were taken immediately to the blood bank for appropriate processing and testing.</p>
