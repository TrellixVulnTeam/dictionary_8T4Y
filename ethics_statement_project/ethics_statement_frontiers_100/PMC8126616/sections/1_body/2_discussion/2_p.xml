<p>Kounis syndrome is an acute coronary syndrome characterized by coronary artery spasm induced by allergic reactions, accompanied or not accompanied by erosion or rupture of atherosclerotic plaque. Patients who present with angina-equivalent symptoms (such as chest pain and dyspnea) and systemic allergic reaction (such as erythematous rash and wheezing) with or without a history of coronary heart disease should be suspected of Kounis syndrome (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Clinical manifestations and medical history are the main diagnostic basis for Kounis syndrome. Blood biochemical tests (serum histamine, immunoglobulin E, eosinophils, tryptase and myocardial enzymes), echocardiography, ECG and coronary angiography results support the diagnosis of Kounis syndrome (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The half-life of serum histamine is approximately 8 min. Therefore, a negative level of serum histamine does not exclude the diagnosis of Kounis syndrome. The application of immunoglobulin E levels in the diagnosis of Kounis syndrome is unclear, and a normal immunoglobulin E level cannot exclude the diagnosis of Kounis syndrome (
