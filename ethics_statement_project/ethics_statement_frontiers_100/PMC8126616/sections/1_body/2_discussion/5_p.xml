<p>In 2015, Dom√≠nguez et al. first reported type III Kounis syndrome with intravascular ultrasound (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Since then, the use of intracoronary imaging techniques (intravascular ultrasound or optical coherence tomography) in the diagnosis of Kounis syndrome are rarely reported. We believe that intracoronary imaging techniques should be an option in cases such as type II Kounis syndrome, where plaque rupture and thrombosis are expected to be found. Intracoronary imaging techniques can help us better understand Kounis syndrome and guide its treatment.
