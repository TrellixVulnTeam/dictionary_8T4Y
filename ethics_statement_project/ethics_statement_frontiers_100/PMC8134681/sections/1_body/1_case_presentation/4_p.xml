<p>Trio-ES data showed that 97.9% (1168/1193) variants had a BAF higher than 0.95 on chromosome 5, meaning the absence of heterozygosity (AOH), which is inherited from the mother (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Array-CGH showed no copy number variants in the proband but complete UPD(5) by showing AOH across the entire chromosome (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). The sizes of AOH in this patient was 172.48 Mb detected by array-CGH, and 170.95 Mb detected by Trio-ES, respectively. Meanwhile, a homozygous nonsense variant in 
 <italic>PCSK1</italic> (NM_000439: c.238C&gt;T, p.Arg80Ter) was detected in the proband, while her mother was a heterozygous carrier and her father was normal (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). This variant was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). The variant whose site is highly conserved among different species caused a protein truncation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Trio-ES did not identify any other pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants associated with the patient's clinical features or other inherited diseases.
