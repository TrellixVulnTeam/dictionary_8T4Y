<p>The proband was a 7 month-23-day old girl at admission. She was born to a healthy non-consanguineous couple after an uneventful full-term pregnancy and was born without anomalies. But on day 3, the infant began diarrhea with watery stool over ten times a day. When she was 1 month old, she manifested jaundice and cholestasis with mild abnormal liver enzymes. During the first month, different types of infant formulas and breast milk were performed on her, but the diarrhea was not controlled. Then she was fed with amino acid-based formula until 8 months old, with diarrhea persisting. At her 8 months old, the routine stool test of her was not very informative, except for some fat globules existing. The enteric adenovirus, rotavirus, and norovirus were all negative tested by the immune gold standard method. The immunoglobulin, including IgA, IgG, IgM and IgE were normal, meaning that she had no immunity system deficiency. Her liver enzymes were still abnormal, AST 85.6 (normal 13–35 U/L); ALT 129.2 (normal 7–40 U/L), together with asymptomatic hypoglycemia, blood glucose 3.8 (normal 3.9–6.1 mmol/L). However, when she was 10 months old, her liver enzyme and blood glucose turned to normal. From then on, rice porridge was added to her meals with regular infant formula, and she can drink 300–500 ml water and 1,000 ml milk per day. Now she had loose stool twice to five times per day.
