<p>As reported, 88.5 percent (23 of 26) families had a history of consanguinity (Martin et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Pepin et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Among the homozygous pathogenic variants, only one patient (Asn423Lys) was not in consanguinity but inherited from both parents (Martin et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In this study, our patient had the homozygous variant inherited from the heterozygous carrier mother. Both array-CGH and Trio-ES data exclude any genomic deletion in this infant. Using the method to detect UPDs from Trio-ES data in our team (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), we found that variants of the infant on chromosome 5 were 97.9% homozygous and maternally inherited, suggesting it was iUPD(5)mat. It is worth mentioning that there are three imprinting genes- 
 <italic>RHOBTB3, ERAP2</italic>, and 
 <italic>VTRNA2-1</italic> on chromosome 5. All of these regions were paternally imprinted, suggesting that imprinting is not a pathogenic mechanism for our patient. Till now, the reports of uniparental disomy of chromosome 5 due to homozygous mutant expression of recessive diseases are still rare. Our patient was the tenth case of UPD(5), and the fourth of UPD(5)mat. Different from the typical autosomal recessive disease, the recurrence risk for this family is relatively low.
