<p>In conclusion, we report the first case of PC1/3 deficiency caused by iUPD(5)mat with a nonsense homozygous variant of the 
 <italic>PCSK1</italic> gene. Our results highlight that patients, particularly in those families without consanguinity, have the possibility of UPD as a cause of autosomal recessive disorders. The early genetic diagnosis for this girl may avoid unnecessary tests and provided precision treatment in time.
