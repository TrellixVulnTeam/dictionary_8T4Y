 <italic>PCSK1</italic> encodes the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1, which involves the proteolytic activation of polypeptide hormones and neuropeptides precursors. Defects in this gene have been associated with susceptibility to obesity (Ramos-Molina et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and congenital proprotein convertase 1/3 deficiency (PC1/3 deficiency) (Martin et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Pepin et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>)â€”also called obesity with impaired prohormone processing [OMIM: 600955]. Here, we report a new case that suffered from recurrent diarrhea since 3 days old, with a homozygous nonsense pathogenic variant in 
 <italic>PCSK1</italic> (Arg80Ter). The variant was predicted to lead to a premature stop codon. The truncated protein may lose the entire catalytic domain, P domain, C-terminal tail, and part propeptide. This variant was once detected in a family with obesity disorder. The variant was overexpressed in the 293T cell line, and they found that the activity of wild-type PC1/3 was inhibited (Philippe et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, that is an experiment not with tissue/cells from the patient. In addition, truncating protein could be generated when some mRNA escapes nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Therefore, the detection of truncating protein in a cell line does not rule out the possibility of NMD. Further studies will be needed to determine whether NMD occurs for this variant. Besides, all of the heterozygous carriers in the family showed obesity or overweight; the lowest BMI of the carrier was 26.91. The patient's mother in our study show overweight (BMI: 25.4) but not obesity.
