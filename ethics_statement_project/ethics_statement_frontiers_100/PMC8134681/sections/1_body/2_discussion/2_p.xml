<p>We updated the summary of patients with PC1/3 deficiency carrying PCSK1 variants from Lucie Pe'pin's review (Pepin et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The first patient carrying compound heterozygous variants of 
 <italic>PCSK1</italic> gene showing postnatal malabsorptive diarrhea and early-onset obesity was reported in 1997 (Jackson et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). Since then, 26 more cases of PC1/3 deficiency have been reported. Including our study, the 28 cases shared 25 distinct 
 <italic>PCSK1</italic> gene variants (Pepin et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Serra et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). All of the 28 patients had early-onset severe malabsorptive diarrhea, and one of them was firstly diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (Serra et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Among them, 96.3 percent (
 <italic>n</italic> = 26/27) are younger than 1 month (seven patients under 3 days old). Early-onset obesity (before 5 years) was observed in 80% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 20/25). Most of the patients got the genetic diagnosis when they suffered severe obesity and diabetes, or central diabetes insipidus. Our case was diagnosed at 8 months old. She was continually followed-up until 11 months; she could drink milk/water &gt;1000 ml/day. She has not presented obesity or diabetes, but her BMI was increasing. So, diet control was suggested to prevent obesity and to control glucose levels.
