<p>Currently, four genes are reported to be related to enteroendocrine cell dysfunction, including 
 <italic>NEUROGS</italic> (causing congenital malabsorptive diarrhea 4), 
 <italic>PCSK1</italic> (causing obesity with impaired prohormone processing/proprotein convertase 1/3 deficiency, or PCSK1 deficiency) (Younis et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), and genes causing a syndromic disease with diarrheaâ€”
 <italic>ARX</italic> (leading to X-linked lissencephaly 2 or hydranencephaly with abnormal genitalia) and 
 <italic>RFX</italic> (leading to Mitchell-Riley syndrome) (Thiagarajah et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Elkadri, 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Among the above disorders, PCSK1 deficiency is an age-related CDD, with neonatal-onset severe malabsorptive diarrhea, but the intestinal phenotype will disappear later and the patient would even develop obesity with multiple endocrine abnormalities (Jackson et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Frank et al.,
