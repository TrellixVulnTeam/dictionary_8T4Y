<p>Uniparental isodisomy (iUPD), which means both alleles originating from a single-parental homologous chromosome, is an underestimated cause of autosomal recessive disorders (Yamazawa et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Currently, nine patients had been reported with uniparental disomy of chromosome 5 [UPD(5)] with homozygous variants (Park et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Gonzalez-Quintana et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). However, maternal iUPD of chromosome 5 (iUPD(5) mat) with a homozygous pathogenic variant in 
 <italic>PCSK1</italic> has never been reported.
