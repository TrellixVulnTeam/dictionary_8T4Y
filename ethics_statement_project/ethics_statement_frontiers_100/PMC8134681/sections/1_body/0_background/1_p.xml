<p>Congenital diarrhea diseases (CDDs) are a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by watery diarrhea and are the major cause of neonatal mortalities worldwide (Younis et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The World Health Organization defines diarrhea as three or more loose or liquid stools per day or an increase in defecation frequency. Early diagnosis of CDD is critical to prevent the progression of the disease to avoid adverse outcomes. With genetic testing increasingly applied to clinical use, the genetic causes of CDDs were gradually revealed and the candidate of causative genes was accumulating (Elkadri, 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Younis et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). These genes were functionally divided into five different subgroups, including the defects in epithelial nutrient and electrolyte transport, epithelial enzyme and metabolism, epithelial trafficking and polarity, enteroendocrine cell, and immune system (Thiagarajah et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Elkadri,
