 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinomas (PSCs) are a heterogeneous group of non-small-cell lung carcinomas containing five subgroups, namely pleomorphic carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, giant cell carcinoma, carcinosarcoma, and pulmonary blastoma, which comprise 0.1% to 0.4% of all pulmonary malignancies (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Epidemiologically, the average age of diagnosis is 60 years. Because SC is most commonly observed in heavy smokers, there is also a male predominance (
