<p>Anlotinib hydrochloride is a novel multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that has a significant inhibitory effect on tumor angiogenesis and proliferative signaling by selectively targeting VEGFR-2,-3 and FGFR-1,-2,-3,-4 and suppressing the activity of PDGFRα/β, C-has Kit, Ret, Aurora-B, C-FMS, and discoidin domain receptor (DDR1) (
