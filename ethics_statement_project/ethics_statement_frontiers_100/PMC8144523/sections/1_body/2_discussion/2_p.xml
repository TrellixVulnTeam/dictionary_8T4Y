<p>The programmed death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) axis is a classical immune checkpoint pathway. Tumor cells utilize this immunosuppressive co-signal to evade immune defenses in the tumor microenvironment. A blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis has restored effector T-cell function and enhanced antitumor immune activity in preclinical studies (
