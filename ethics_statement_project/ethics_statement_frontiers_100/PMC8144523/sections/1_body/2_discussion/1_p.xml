<p>PSC is a rare malignancy of NSCLC and has a poorly differentiated and aggressive signature (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). At present, there are no standard treatments for the malignancy. Platinum-based chemotherapy for NSCLC has long been used for PSC patients, but prognosis has remained poor and the median OS is no more than nine months for metastatic disease according to previous studies (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In previous clinical practice, we treated some PSC patients using platinum-based chemotherapies such as pemetrexed combined with cisplatin or gemcitabine combined with cisplatin, but the responses were disappointing. We also used gemcitabine and taxanes, which are therapeutic regimens for STS. Unfortunately, the response has still been unsatisfactory. Therefore, it is necessary to identify new active agents to improve the therapeutic effect for PSC patients. Sarcomatoid carcinoma is a malignancy with a combination of epithelial and sarcoma or sarcoma-like components. We therefore used a new chemotherapy agent comprising dacarbazine and cis-platinum. Dacarbazine is a standard anti-sarcoma agent with classically known activity, generally reserved as a later line of therapy, and cis-platinum is a major component of NSCLC treatment (
