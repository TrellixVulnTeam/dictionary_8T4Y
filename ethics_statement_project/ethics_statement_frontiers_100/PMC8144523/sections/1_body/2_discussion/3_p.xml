<p>Recently, several studies have focused on the genetic features of this disease and revealed a wide range of alterations, including TP53, EGFR, KRAS, PIK3CA, STK11, BRCA1/BRCA2, and IDH1 mutations; MET exon 14 mutations; and MET, ALK, EGFR, CDK4, and MDM2 amplifications, some of which are associated with targeted therapy through the MET receptor pathway or MAP-kinase pathway (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In this case, ten somatic mutations including two common mutations, specifically TP53 and KRAS, along with other occasional mutations, specifically BRAD1, EPCAM, EPHA3, FGFR2, RAC1, RAD54L, SMARCA4, and TERT, were found by NGS. Unfortunately, common mutations of EGFR, ALK, and ROS-1 genes were not found.
