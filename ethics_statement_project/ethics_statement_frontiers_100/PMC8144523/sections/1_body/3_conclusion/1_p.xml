<p>In summary, we combined chemotherapy with a small molecular TKI known as anlotinib for a PSC patient and achieved a long PFS and remarkable tumor regression. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of the successful treatment of this disease by using this combined treatment. Future clinical trials are expected to validate these new treatments for PSC patients.</p>
