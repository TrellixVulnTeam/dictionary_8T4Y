<p>Standard economic theory predicts that workers will not exert effort in any setting where effort is unrelated to outcome. However, we propose a moral psychology account to explain when and why people will exert effort in a game of pure luck. Moral psychology relies upon three normative ethical theories as a point of departure for moral judgment: consequentialist ethics, whereby the moral value of an action is evaluated on the basis of its material outcomes; deontological ethics, whereby the moral value of an action is judged on the basis of rules, duties, and obligations; and virtue ethics, in which the individual and not the action is the unit of moral evaluation (

Typical examples include maximizing welfare and flourishing, minimizing resources spent, and maximizing lives saved (

Consequentialist ethics provide little explanation for effortful work in a game of pure luck since the efforts of the worker are, by definition, unrelated to outcomes. Deontological ethical theories state that an action is right or wrong based on whether it violates a set of rules, duties, and obligations that are seen as foundational to morality (

According to this view, an action can be wrong despite bringing about good consequences, and an action can be right despite bringing about bad consequences. Some actions may also be duty-bound even if they are unrelated to outcomes. In a game of luck, a worker should labor intensively if they adhere to a moral norm that states that hard work is an obligation in and of itself, regardless of its efficacy. Based on this assertion, we hypothesize that:
