<p>When the participants entered the lab, they drew a number from a jar that determined their place in the lab and subsequently their role; this also acted as a salient randomization device. An experimenter then read aloud general instructions about the rules, and the participants had 10 min to read the printed instructions carefully before the z-Tree (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Fischbacher, 2007</xref>) program started. The written instructions contained information about the game, but these were not read aloud due to the nature of the treatments (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Appendix A</xref> for full instructions). To verify that they had understood the instructions, workers had to answer correctly four true-or-false questions about the design. Then, their beliefs about how the employer would distribute rewards were elicited. The workers labored for 20 min. After the working period, workers saw their effort and learned their output based on what was drawn by the computer. When the employer made the distribution, we elicited the same beliefs as before the working period to test whether their beliefs had changed during the working period. We also asked the workers how they thought the employer should distribute the money. The responses to these questions were not incentivized.
