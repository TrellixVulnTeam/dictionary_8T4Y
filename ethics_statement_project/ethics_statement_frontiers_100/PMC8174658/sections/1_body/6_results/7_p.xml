<p>In contrast, when effort was not observed by the employer, the role of luck seemed to matter. In EULK and EULU groups, effort was not observed by the employer, and 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> demonstrates that workers labored harder when the employer also did not know that earnings were determined by luck. However, while the mean effort in EULU was roughly 10% higher than in EULK, the difference is not statistically significant. Splitting our data by sex in
