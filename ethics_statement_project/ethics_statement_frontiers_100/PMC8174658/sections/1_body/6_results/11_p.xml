<p>According to Model 4, female workers were significantly affected by whether the employer could observe effort. We did not hypothesize a gender difference at the outset of the experiment, but choose to report it here. In EOLK, female workers solved significantly more decoding tasks than they did in EULK, as shown by the positive coefficient of 13.62 for 
 <italic>Effort observed.</italic> Also, female workers in EOLU solved close to 10 (13.62 + 9.99 – 14. − 5 = 9.56) more decoding tasks compared to those in EULK. This difference is also significant [Wald test: 
 <italic>F</italic>(3, 130) = 3.47, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02].
