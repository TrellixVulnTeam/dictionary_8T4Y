<p>A second observation highlights how workers labored harder if the employer could observe their effort, as compared to when the employer did not see effort. As shown in 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, effort provision when effort was observed and the role of luck was known (59.24) was significantly higher compared to effort provision when the role of luck was known by the employer, and effort was not observed by the employer (48.97). Qualitatively, a similar result was observed when comparing the two treatments in which the role of luck was not known to the employer, and effort was observed (58.43) or unobserved (53.81) by the employer. However, the difference is not significant, with a p-value of 0.106. Focusing only on the effect of effort observability, we combined the two treatments where the employer observed effort (EOLK and EOLU), comparing them to the two treatments where effort was not observed by the employer (EULK and EULU). This yielded a significantly higher effort when the employer could observe effort, with a mean effort of 58.84 compared to 51.51 for the combination of treatments where effort was not observed by the employer (Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic>-test, 
 <italic>z</italic> = âˆ’3.25, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). Thus, effort provision was clearly affected by whether the employer could observe effort. However, even when effort was unobservable to employers, most workers chose to exert effort. This is consistent with social norms advocating that hard work is a moral duty and an obligation in and of itself.
