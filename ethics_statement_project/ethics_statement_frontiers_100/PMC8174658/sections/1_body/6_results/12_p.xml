<p>Interestingly, the positive and significant coefficient for 
 <italic>Luck unknown</italic> demonstrated female workers labored harder if they were paired with an employer who did not observe effort and also did not know the role of luck (EULK≈45 versus EULU≈45+10). This result indicates that female workers were sensitive to whether the employer knew the scenario was a game of luck. However, we only find evidence for such an effect when effort was unobserved by the employer. When the employer could see effort provision, the effort-observability effect seems to dominate, and we observe no significant difference between the treatments where the employer was informed or not informed about the role of luck [EOLK≈59 and EOLU≈55, Wald test: 
 <italic>F</italic>(1, 130) = 0.99, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.32]. One interpretation of this result is that effort observability was less effective for female workers when the employer did not know the scenario was a game of luck. This suggests female workers may labor harder compared to other groups in order to avoid undeserved rewards. Another way of looking at this is by the significant interaction term, which indicates the difference in effort between EOLK and EULK diverges from the difference in effort between EOLU and EULU.
