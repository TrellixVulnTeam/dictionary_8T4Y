<p>Our design seeks to distinguish between two main aspects that could motivate effort: effort observability and employer knowledge about the relationship (or lack of relationship) between effort and outcome. Thus, we employed a two-by-two design with the following four treatments. In the EOLK treatment (Effort Observable, role of Luck Known) effort was visible to the employer, and the role of luck was common knowledge. In EOLU treatment (Effort Observable, role of Luck Unknown) effort was also visible to the employer, but only the workers were told about the role of luck. In EULK treatment (Effort Unobservable, role of Luck Known) effort was not visible to the employer, while the role of luck was common knowledge. Finally, in EULU treatment (Effort Unobservable, role of Luck Unknown) effort was not visible for the employer, and only the worker was informed about the role of luck.</p>
