<p>A 5-year-old male patient was brought to our hospital with complaints of abdominal pain and fever. Physical examination showed a sign of peritonitis, while abdominal X-rays revealed a small-bowel obstruction. We initially diagnosed him with perforated appendicitis and performed an exploratory laparotomy. During the procedure, we found a perforated MD and an inflamed appendix, but it was not perforated. Next, we conducted segmental small-bowel resection, primary anastomosis, and appendectomy. Histopathological findings established MD (
