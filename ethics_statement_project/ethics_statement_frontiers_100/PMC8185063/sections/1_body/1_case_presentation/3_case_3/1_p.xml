<p>A 17-month-old female was referred to us because of severe iron-deficiency anemia. Previously, she had type 3A ileal atresia and underwent ileostomy and stoma closure at 2 days old and 6 months old, respectively, with good outcomes. Since the age of 7 months, she started having severe iron-deficiency anemia without gross gastrointestinal bleeding. Her hemoglobin level decreased continuously by ~2â€“6 g/dL. She routinely received a blood transfusion due to her severe anemia. She presented a positive benzidine test result for occult blood in her feces. She had been checked for etiologies of severe anemia and showed no hemolytic anemia. We performed an upper gastrointestinal (GI) series and found no abnormality in the upper GI tract. We then decided to perform an exploratory laparotomy and found a large MD with a diameter of ~7 cm (
