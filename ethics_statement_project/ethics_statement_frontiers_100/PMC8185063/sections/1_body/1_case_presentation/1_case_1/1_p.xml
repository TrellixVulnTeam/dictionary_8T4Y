<p>A 2-month-old female patient was referred to our hospital with complaints of bilious vomiting and abdominal distention. Plain abdominal X-ray showed small-bowel obstruction. Due to the worsening of the clinical manifestations, the patient then underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy without any further imaging examination. A volvulus of fibrous tissue of the vitelline duct and MD were found (
