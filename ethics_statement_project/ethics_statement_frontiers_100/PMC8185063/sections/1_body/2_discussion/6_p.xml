<p>Since the clinical presentation of MD varies among children, its diagnosis might be difficult, particularly in pediatric populations (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Without early surgical intervention, the symptomatic MD will lead to complications, including intestinal obstruction, bleeding, and perforation (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). For our third case, we failed to definitively diagnose MD using the upper GI series. This might be due to the barrier of the diverticulum entry by edema (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Some supporting examinations have been proposed to establish and confirm the diagnosis of MD, including double balloon enteroscopy and video capsule endoscopy (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Unfortunately, our institution does not have any advanced diagnostic tools for MD, including double balloon enteroscopy and video capsule endoscopy. Accordingly, we decided to perform an exploratory laparotomy for this case. In addition, the persistence of anemia after resection of MD might be the consequence of previous ileal atresia (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) or intestinal malabsorption (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).
