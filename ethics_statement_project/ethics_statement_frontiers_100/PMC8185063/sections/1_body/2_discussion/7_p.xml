<p>There are several surgical approaches for MD, such as segmental small-bowel resection including MD and diverticulectomy only (

Some surgeons prefer to perform segmental small-bowel resection, including MD, because they want to include any possible intestinal ulceration within the resection samples, while other surgeons choose the latter because they consider that the ulcerated ileum is close to the ectopic gastric mucosa (
