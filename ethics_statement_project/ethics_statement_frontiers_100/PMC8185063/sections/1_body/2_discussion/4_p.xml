<p>Our third case suffered from severe iron deficiency anemia. Gastrointestinal bleeding in MD has been proposed because of the damaged intestinal lumen due to the acid produced by ectopic gastric mucosa in MD (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In this case, no gross intestinal bleeding was found, except occult bleeding shown by the positive benzidine test in her feces, and no ectopic gastric mucosa was present. One of the hypotheses of occult bleeding in MD without ectopic gastric mucosa is inverted MD (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), but this was not the case for our patient. Moreover, the presence of MD might be overlooked during the surgical treatment of intestinal atresia.
