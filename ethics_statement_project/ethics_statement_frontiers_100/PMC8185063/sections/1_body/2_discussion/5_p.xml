<p>There are several etiologies of perforated MD (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), such as irritation from a foreign body, pressure necrosis of the MD wall, or spontaneous perforation due to progressive inflammation of the MD wall, as in our second case. We performed appendectomy in this case as well because of the inflamed appendix. A previous report also performed an appendectomy for a mildly inflamed appendix during the surgical treatment of MD (
