<p>Individuals with MD are usually asymptomatic, but they might present with a variety of clinical features, such as small-bowel obstruction, peritonitis, or gross/occult gastrointestinal bleeding/bloody stool (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Due to its various clinical presentations, it can be misdiagnosed, particularly in pediatric patients. Only 11% of patients with MD are correctly preoperatively diagnosed as MD, while about 11% of MD are misdiagnosed as acute appendicitis (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The mortality rate of MD is ~6% and often associated with delayed diagnosis and treatment (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Therefore, it is necessary for pediatric surgeons to recognize its various clinical manifestations early (
