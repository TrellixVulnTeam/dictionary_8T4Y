<p>For the blog genre, a chi-squared test showed a significant association between culture (Chinese and American) and pride (individual, relational, national, and general), χ

 <italic>N</italic> = 2,925) = 278.50, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, Cramer's 
 <italic>V</italic> = 0.31, which is larger than a large effect size (0.29) (Cohen, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>). For both genres, compared with the Chinese corpus, the American corpus contained more items pertaining to individual pride and fewer items pertaining to relational pride (see 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). For national pride, cross-cultural differences showed opposite patterns for the two genres: The Chinese news genre contained more national pride items than its American counterpart, whereas the opposite was true for the blog genre. The remainder category (general pride) also showed opposite patterns—a higher frequency for Chinese blogs than for American blogs but a lower frequency for Chinese news than for American news.
