<p>Theoretically, members of individualistic cultures tend to construe the self as separate from their social context and develop independent self-construal and individual pride, whereas members of collectivistic cultures tend to perceive the self as a constituent of the social context and thus develop interdependent self-construal and collective pride (Markus and Kitayama, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). Indeed, an earlier study indicated that different types of pride were distinctly influenced by cultural backgrounds. Stipek (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>) found that individuals in collectivistic cultures (e.g., China) would experience stronger pride if their children were accepted into a prestigious University than if they themselves were accepted, whereas people in individualistic cultures (e.g., the United States) would experience equal pride in these two circumstances. Through a cultural priming study, Neumann et al. (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) also noted that cultural orientation affected the experience of pride: Interdependent self-construal priming led to greater pride in achievements of others, whereas independent self-construal priming led to greater pride in personal achievements.
