Within the pride items, however, we hypothesized that the frequency of mentions of individual pride would be higher in the American corpus than in the Chinese corpus, whereas the frequency of mentions of collective pride would be lower in the American corpus than in the Chinese corpus. Because previous research showed that emotional expressions differed by the genre of the corpus (Mahdar,
