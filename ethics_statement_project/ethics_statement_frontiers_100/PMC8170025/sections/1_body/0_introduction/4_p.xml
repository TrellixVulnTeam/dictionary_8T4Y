<p>Cross-cultural research on pride remains quite limited. Furthermore, relevant studies have primarily relied on the questionnaire or scenario data, which are subject to social desirability and self-serving biases (Taylor and Brown, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Dunning et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Lindeman and Verkasalo, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Paulhus and John, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Dunning, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Robins and Beer, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). One method to overcome the limitations of self-report data is to use semantic analysis, which can mitigate ethnocentric bias (Gladkova, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) as well as social desirability and self-serving biases (Cohen, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Several scholars have examined cultural differences using corpus-based methods (Gladkova, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Apresjan, 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). For example, Apresjan (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) found that Russian speakers tended to express more passive emotions (e.g., fear) than English speakers, whereas English speakers tended to express more active negative emotions (e.g., anger).
