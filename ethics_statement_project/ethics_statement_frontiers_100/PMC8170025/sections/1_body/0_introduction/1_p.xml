<p>Pride is a basic human emotion and refers to a self-conscious emotion derived from one's achievements. Depending on whether such achievements are attributable to oneself or to a group to which one belongs, the sense of pride is labeled as either individual or group/collective pride (Berkowitz and Levy,

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Liu et al.,

Previous research has documented cross-cultural differences in pride in general and in individual pride and collective pride in particular, but no study has examined cultural differences in individual pride and collective pride using text corpora.
