The COCA contains more than 1.0 billion words of the English text (20 million words per year from 1990 to 2019) and is equally divided among spoken language, fiction, magazines, newspapers, academic texts, web pages, blogs, and TV/movies. The spoken genre mainly included conversations from TV and radio programs in the United States, and the fiction genre included short stories and plays from magazines. Magazines and newspaper genres were from nearly 100 different magazines and newspapers from across the United States.
