 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Lu and Coxhead, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). To improve comparability of the two corpora, namely, blogs and news, we selected English blogs (only available for the year 2012) and Chinese blogs (only available for the year 2013). The news genres covered the years from 1990 to 2019 for both Chinese and English corpora.
