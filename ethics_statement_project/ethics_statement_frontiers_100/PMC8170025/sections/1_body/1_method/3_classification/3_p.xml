<p>The frequency results were analyzed using a chi-squared test. To determine which type of pride differed significantly between the two corpora, we calculated the adjusted standardized residuals (
 <italic>z</italic>-score) by standardizing the difference between observed values and expected values (Sharpe, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The absolute value of adjusted residuals &gt;2 is considered to be significant at Î± = 0.05 (Haberman, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">1973</xref>).
