<p>Several limitations of this study and their implications for future research need to be mentioned. First, we relied on limited cultural corpus samples (Chinese and American), to represent individualistic and collectivistic cultures. We did not include other major varieties of English language such as British and Australian English, which have been found to involve different cultural scripts in emotional expressions (Goddard, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Future research should replicate our finding using corpora from other varieties of the English language as well as other languages representing individualistic cultures (e.g., German and French) and collectivistic cultures (e.g., Japanese, Korean, Mexican, and Spanish). Second, we did not analyze temporal changes in individual pride and collective pride. Several recent studies have indicated that cultural patterns can shift over time (Twenge et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Hamamura and Xu, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Zeng and Greenfield, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Future research should consider time-series analysis. Such an approach may also reveal the importance of single events on national pride (c.f., the role of sporting events in national pride, Kavetsos, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Finally, our text analysis can be complemented by cross-cultural experiments that would reveal relevant cognitive and emotional mechanisms.
