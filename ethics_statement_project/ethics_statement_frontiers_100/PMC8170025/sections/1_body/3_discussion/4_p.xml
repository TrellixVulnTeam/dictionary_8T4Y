<p>Expressions of individual pride in interdependent cultures may be decreased or avoided to minimize potential interpersonal conflict and maintain social harmony (Scollon et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Matsumoto et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Indeed, individual pride may be associated with negative emotions in Asian cultures (Stipek, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Scollon et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Chinese individuals may also be more modest than individuals in Western cultures, especially in terms of individual pride (Heine et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). However, relational pride is encouraged in Eastern cultures; several studies have suggested that collective culture promotes pride for others (such as one's family, friends, and team) (Stipek et al., 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Neumann et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Liu et al.,
