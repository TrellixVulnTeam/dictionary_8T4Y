  <italic>Nocardia</italic> genus is an aerobic, gram-positive, and opportunistic pathogen, which mainly affects cell-mediated immunosuppressed patients. Early diagnosis and treatment greatly improve prognosis. However, the limitation of golden standard-bacterial culture exists. Here, we report a 61-year-old male with pneumonia, sepsis and intermuscular abscesses induced by 
  <italic>Nocardia farcinica</italic>. Venous blood culture reported negative results. Former improper diagnosis and treatment did not improve his condition. With the assistant of metagenomic next-generation sequencing, the pathogen was identified as 
  <italic>Nocardia farcinica</italic>. He was then applied with accurate treatment and had a remarkable clinical and radiological improvement.
