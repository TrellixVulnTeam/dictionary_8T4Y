Considering the patient's clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and the history of corticosteroid drugs use, this patient was firstly considered as the infection of opportunistic pathogens. A treatment with linezolid intravenous 0.6 g twice a day and piperacillin/tazobactam intravenous 4.5 g three times a day was initiated to control the infection.
