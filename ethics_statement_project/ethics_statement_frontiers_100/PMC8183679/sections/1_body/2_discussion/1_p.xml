 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), such as patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), chronic granulomatous disease (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), transplant recipients (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and with drug-induced systemic immunosuppression (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). It is also found that one-third of nocardiosis patients are immunocompetent (
