<p>The traditional diagnostic method of nocardiosis is culture. A culture of 
 <italic>Nocardia</italic> usually takes 2–7 days, which may delay establishing the diagnosis. Moreover, most patients with nocardiosis may receive antibiotic treatment before samples collection, reducing microbial culture sensitivity (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In 2005, 16S rRNA–based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was reported to detect 
 <italic>Nocardia</italic> on clinical samples, with high sensitivity and specificity (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), whereas the method requires the pre-considerations of 
 <italic>Nocardia</italic> infection by clinicians. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is a new approach with characteristics of high sensitivity, rapid detection and less affected by prior antibiotics usage (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). This is an unbiased method and can theoretically detect all kinds of pathogens, which is suitable for difficult and atypical infectious diseases (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The former study reported mean time to diagnosis was 42 days, which may lead to poor clinical prognosis especially in immunosuppression patients (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In this case, mNGS only took 2 days to detect pathogens and significantly reduced hospital days. A recent study revealed that 14 samples were identified to be 
 <italic>Nocardia</italic> spp. positive by mNGS, whereas only five of them obtained positive results of culture (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). This patient's negative blood culture may due to the influence of prior antibiotics usage.
