<p>Treatment of nocardiosis is individualized (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Sulfonamides were initially used as nocardiosis treatment (

 <italic>Nocardia</italic> nowadays is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Linezolid and carbapenem are also used in nocardiosis (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In this case, previously carbapenem use did not control the infection, whereas treatment of TMP-SMX and linezolid provided symptomatic improvement.
