 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> was also detected by mNGS in BALF. Carbapenem was applied at local hospital but without response. It could be deduced that the 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> of the patient responded less sensitive to carbapenem. There was another possibility that 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> was hospital-acquired infections in ICU of our hospital. Before the detection of 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, the therapy of linezolid, piperacillin/tazobactam and TMP-SMX greatly relieved the patient's symptoms. Actually, linezolid and piperacillin/tazobactam also had clinical efficiency with 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Therefore, the former treatment was not changed and then patient completely recovered. 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> in this case may be more sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam, or a combination of these drugs.
