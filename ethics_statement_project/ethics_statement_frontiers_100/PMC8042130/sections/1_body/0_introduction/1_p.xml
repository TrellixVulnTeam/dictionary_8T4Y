<p>The era of geriatric surgery has arrived (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). With a rapidly aging global population, increasing numbers of surgical operations are being performed on older adults. While several surgical risk factors increase with age, increasing age itself independently predicts postoperative morbidity and mortality (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Older patients who undergo surgical procedures present great challenges in the perioperative management. To improve the outcomes after geriatric surgery, intensive efforts are required, including careful preoperative risk assessment, treatment for comorbidities, optimal surgical techniques and anesthesia management, and implementation of enhanced recovery after surgery.
