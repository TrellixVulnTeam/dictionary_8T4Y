<p>Therefore, the present study aims to determine the effects of withholding vs. continuing ACEIs/ARBs before non-cardiac surgery in older hypertensive adults. The primary outcome measure of this study is the incidence of perioperative hypotension that occurs during surgery and in a post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). The secondary outcome measures include duration of perioperative hypotension, intraoperative use of fluids and vasopressors, and hypotensive events within postoperative 3 days, as well as neurocognitive function, cardiocerebral outcomes, and mortality within 30 days after surgery. We will mainly test the hypothesis that the withholding of ACEI on the day of surgery will decrease the number of perioperative hypotensive events in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.</p>
