<p>At each study center, an independent preoperative investigator who is not involved in patient care or data management will screen patients' admission records to identify potentially qualified participants. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria and provide their written informed consent will be included in this study. According to the sample size estimation, a total of 2,036 eligible patients who plan to undergo non-cardiac surgical procedures will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to an ACEIs/ARBs continued group or an ACEIs/ARBs withheld group. Patients can withdraw their consent at any time during this study. The patient recruitment started on November 1, 2020. The expected date for completion of recruitment is December 2023. The flow chart of participants is shown in
