<p>Data distribution and normality will be assessed with Shapiro-Wilk test. Continuous variables will be presented as mean Â± standard deviation or median (interquartile ranges), depending on their distribution. Categorical variables will be presented as number (percentages). All analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle, which includes all participants after randomization and excludes the patients who drop out of the study due to withdrawal of informed consent or cancellation of surgery. The per-protocol analysis will be carried out as a sensitivity analysis, which includes all participants with planned interventions and minimal protocol violation. As we expect that the missing data will be uncommon in our dataset, there will be no plan for imputation of missing data.</p>
