<p>The sample size calculation was performed using the PASS software (version 11.0.7, NCSS, LCC, Kaysville, UT, USA). Based on an international prospective cohort study of 4802 patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, the incidence of intraoperative hypotensive events was 28.6% in the ACEIs/ARBs continued group (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). We hypothesize that the suspension of ACEIs/ARBs before surgery would reduce the incidence of hypotension by 20%, that is, to a hypotension rate of 22.88%. To detect such a difference with Î± = 0.05 and power = 80%, 916 patients per group are needed. We estimate a drop-out rate of 10%, and thus 1,018 patients will be enrolled in each group.
