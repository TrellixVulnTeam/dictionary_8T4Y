<p>In the operating room, patients will receive a standard monitoring including heart rate (HR), non-invasive blood pressure, and pulse oximetry. Induction of general anesthesia will be performed with sufentanil 0.2–0.4 μg/kg and etomidate 0.2–0.3 mg/kg. Tracheal intubation will be facilitated with rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg or cisatracurium 0.2 mg/kg. Mechanical ventilation will be performed with a tidal volume of 8–10 ml/kg, frequency of 12–18 breaths/min, adjusted to maintain end-tidal CO
 <sub>2</sub> values within 30–40 mmHg. General anesthesia will be maintained with propofol infusion titrated to bispectral index (BIS) values within 40–60, or with sevoflurane inhalation titrated to end-tidal minimal alveolar concentration within 0.8–1.3. To provide adequate intraoperative analgesia and neuromuscular blockade, additional doses of sufentanil and rocuronium (or cisatracurium) can be administered. Body temperature will be maintained at 36–37°C with a nasopharyngeal probe by using a warming blanket and/or an infusion heating device. Other perioperative management will be left to the discretion of the attending anesthesiologists according to the routine practice of each study center. After tracheal extubation, patients will be transferred to the PACU. When a modified Aldrete score ≥ 9 is achieved, patients will be discharged from the PACU to the surgical wards.
