<p>To our knowledge, this is the first multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with an adequate power to assess the impact of ACEIs/ARBs management strategies on the occurrence of perioperative hypotension and major complications in older patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. The second strength of the present trial is that, to increase the precision of statistical estimates, the primary analysis of perioperative hypotension will be adjusted using a multivariate logistic regression model for a number of baseline covariates, based on the knowledge of the association between each variable and patient outcome. Next, to explore whether the effects of study interventions will vary for several variables, subgroup analyses for the primary outcome will be performed using a logistic regression model.</p>
