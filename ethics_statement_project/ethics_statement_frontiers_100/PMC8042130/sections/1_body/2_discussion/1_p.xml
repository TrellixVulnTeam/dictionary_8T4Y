<p>In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of older hypertensive adults undergoing noncardiac surgery, the primary objective is to evaluate the effects of withholding vs. continuing ACEIs/ARBs before surgery on the incidence of perioperative hypotensive events which occur during surgery and in the PACU. In addition, we will analyze the duration of perioperative hypotension, intraoperative use of fluids and vasopressors, hypotensive events within postoperative 3 days, and the rates of PND, MACEs, and mortality within 30 days after surgery. This trial will follow the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guideline (
