<p>There are also some limitations. First, the primary outcome of this trial is the incidence of perioperative hypotensive events, and we designate postoperative cardiovascular and cognitive complications and mortality within 30 days after surgery as the secondary outcomes. This study would be even more impactful if a composite of cerebral and cardiovascular complications is designated as the primary outcome. However, that would increase the sample size to more than 5,400 patients in order to detect a 20% decrease in the incidence of a composite of stroke, myocardial injury, or death (Î± = 0.05, power = 80%), based on the previous study (

Next, we include older adults with ASA physical status II and III, and thus the effects of withholding or continuing ACEIs/ARBs strategies on patients who are sicker (i.e., ASA status IV) need to be assessed in future studies. Last, we exclude very elderly patients who are &gt; 80 years old in this study, because we believe that further investigations on this extremely vulnerable patient population should be carried out carefully, on the basis of the results of our present study.
