<p>Afterwards, to understand the effect of aura in our VSS group itself, we compared VSS patients with migraine with aura (VSSMwA; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 7) and VSS patients with migraine without aura (VSSMwoA; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 5). There was again a significant main effect of SOA interval (rmANOVA: Greenhouse–Geisser 
 <italic>F</italic> 6.31, 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) with a significant suppression of visual accuracy at 100 ms (VSSMwoA: 48.2 ± 31.89 vs. VSSMwA: 60.85 ± 20.21) compared to 40 and 190 ms, but also no significant main effect of group (rmANOVA: 
 <italic>F</italic> 0.40, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.57).
