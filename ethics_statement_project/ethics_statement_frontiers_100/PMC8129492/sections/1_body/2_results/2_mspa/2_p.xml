<p>There was a significant main effect of SOA interval (rmANOVA: Greenhouse–Geisser 
 <italic>F</italic> 31.75, 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01) with a significant suppression of visual accuracy at 100 ms compared to 40 and 190 ms. There was no significant main effect of group (rmANOVA: 
 <italic>F</italic> 0.70, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.47). Additionally, we performed an explorative subgroup analysis beginning with comparing the same control group only with VSS patients without migraine aura, showing almost identical percentages of correctly recognized trigrams at 100 ms (C: 46.40 ± 34.26 vs. VSS: 46.67 ± 27.99), again without significant group differences (rmANOVA: 
 <italic>F</italic> 0.261, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.77).
