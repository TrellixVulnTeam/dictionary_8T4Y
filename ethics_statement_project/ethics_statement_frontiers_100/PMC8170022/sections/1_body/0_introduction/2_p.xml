<p>The idea for a campaign that focused on handwashing was born from many students saying they wash their hands more often after an early laboratory introduced them to the frequency of bacteria around them, the chemistry of handwashing, and a review of proper handwashing techniques. The recent coronavirus pandemic hopefully reminded us all that our hands are important transmission factors in the spread of both respiratory and gastrointestinal infections; thus, the best way to limit pathogen access to our bodies is through good hand hygiene (

Vaccinations were included within this project primarily because the university was changing their policy regarding vaccinations, requiring the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine for all degree-seeking students and the meningococcal vaccine for all students living on campus; however, this is a major medical issue as anti-vaccine campaigns continue to increase. Vaccines were once proclaimed lifesavers by parents, but the number of vaccine-hesitant parents is growing at an alarming rate. It is estimated that 15% of children are under-immunized with parents doubting the effectiveness of vaccines and having concerns regarding the amount of vaccines children are given before the age of two (
