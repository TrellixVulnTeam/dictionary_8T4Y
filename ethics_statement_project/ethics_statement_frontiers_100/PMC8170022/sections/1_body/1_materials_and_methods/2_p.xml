<p>Once the main activities were determined, a strategy was needed to get passing-by students to participate in the campaign. Students wanted to use a food that required participants to use their hands rather than a utensil and decided on popcorn. It was also decided that a freebie item, a syringe pen, would be awarded to those who successfully answered a trivia question. In this strategy, a student assigned as the Go-Getter, would boldly walk up to students, ask them to fill out the surveys, and upon completion, receive a bag of popcorn. Popcorn machines were borrowed from the athletics department and student government association. Another student assigned as the survey collector would instruct students to drop their surveys into a covered box and instruct the participant that they could get their popcorn after they washed their hands. Students assigned as the handwashing police would supply Glitterbug potion and keep the time of handwashing. After properly washing their hands, students were given their popcorn from the student assigned as the popcorn distributor. The student assigned as the trivia host would then ask the student a question for their chance to win a syringe pen. Questions were presented to students in large bold print on a standard piece of paper within a page protector in which the host could read the question and the answer choices were displayed to the participant. For the campaign, microbiology students (6â€“10) were stationed at two high-traffic areas within our campus and were wearing T-shirts with the campaign logo. Each student had a designated role and participated in the campaign for 2 h, while the event occurred at both sites simultaneously for 4 h.</p>
