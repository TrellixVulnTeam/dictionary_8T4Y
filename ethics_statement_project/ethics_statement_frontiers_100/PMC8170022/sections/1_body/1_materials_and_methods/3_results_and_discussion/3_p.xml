<p>Given the importance of handwashing and vaccinations, this service-learning project could be repeated each year. To add flexibility and allow students more control in the planning, venues could be rotated to include elementary classrooms, after-school programs, and senior care facilities. Since a significant amount of data was collected in the campaign, a compilation of the data was undertaken by several students as part of an undergraduate research experience and presented at a local Sigma Xi conference. The results of this campaign have been used to apply for a few internal grants that have allowed for the continuation of the campaign, purchase of our handwashing station to use in outreach events, an increase in the number of public hand sanitizer stations, and inspired a few students to further understand hygiene behaviors specifically within the campus workout facility.</p>
