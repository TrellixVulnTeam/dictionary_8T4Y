<p>To assess the impact of the campaign on microbiology students (
 <italic>n</italic> = 34), they were provided ten questions which were adapted from questions asked in a published study assessing the inclusion of a service-learning project within a microbiology course (
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Webb, 2016</xref>). Questions were scored on a scale from 1 to 5 (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows student gains (score &gt; 3) were reported for depth in knowledge, development of better public speaking skills, and greater respect for volunteers suggesting that the campaign was beneficial. Little effect was shown on student career choices which may not be surprising as this course is typically taken in their third or fourth year when they have started focusing on specific career goals. Thus, it might be helpful to include service-learning projects earlier within the curriculum, perhaps even during a program-specific first-year seminar experience.
