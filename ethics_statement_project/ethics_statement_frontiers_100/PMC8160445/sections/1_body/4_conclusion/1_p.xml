<p>A granular bone graft has a shorter bone graft fusion time compared with a transverse process bone graft in one stage posterior debridement, bone graft fusion, and internal fixation for single-segmental thoracic TB. The two methods may both achieve satisfactory clinical efficacy in appropriate cases. Due to the potential limitations, prospective randomized studies with a large sample size and long follow-up period are needed to validate our findings.</p>
