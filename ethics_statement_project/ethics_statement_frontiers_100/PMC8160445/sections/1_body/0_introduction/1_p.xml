<p>Spinal tuberculosis (TB) is the most common osteoarticular TB, which can cause vertebral body collapse, kyphosis deformity, and even compression of the spinal cord or nerve to cause paralysis in severe cases (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Chemotherapy and surgery are the main treatment for spinal TB (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The aim of the surgery is to relieve the compression of the spinal cord or nerve, reconstruct spinal stability, and correct kyphosis deformity (

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), but the vertebral defect is often left after the debridement, thus a bone graft is of great importance to restore the height of the vertebral body and rebuild the spinal stability (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). At present, the most commonly used bone graft methods in spinal TB surgery are iliac bone grafts and titanium mesh bone grafts (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), but the concerns of autologous bone donor site complications and titanium mesh subsidence get more and more attention (
