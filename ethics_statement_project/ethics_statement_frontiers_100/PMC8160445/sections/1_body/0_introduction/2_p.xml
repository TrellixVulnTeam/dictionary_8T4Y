<p>In recent years, it has been reported that granular bone grafts can achieve satisfactory clinical efficacy and safety in spinal TB surgery (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Our previous study also found that granular bone grafts had a shorter operation time, less operation blood loss, and faster bone graft fusion than structural bone grafts for single-segmental thoracic TB (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Moreover, we also proposed a new bone graft method in thoracic TB surgery, namely transverse process bone grafts. It was reported that transverse process bone grafts could obtain good clinical efficacy for single-segmental thoracic TB with an average bone graft fusion time of 5.85 months without serious complications (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Besides, the transverse process bone graft was found superior to the iliac bone graft and titanium mesh bone graft in surgical trauma, postoperative recovery, and complications (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Therefore, in our previous studies, both granular bone grafts and transverse process bone grafts showed satisfactory clinical results in thoracic TB surgery and thus have a good application prospect.
