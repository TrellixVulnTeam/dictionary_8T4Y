<p>(a) Cobb angle: the angle between the upper endplate of the upper vertebral body and the inferior endplate of the inferior vertebral body. (b) Bone graft fusion time: according to the CT scan bone graft fusion was evaluated by the criterion reported by Bridwell et al. (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Grade I: Fused with remodeling and trabeculae. Grade II: Graft intact, not fully remodeled and incorporated though; no lucencies. Grade III: Graft intact, but a definite lucency at the top or bottom of the graft. Grade IV: Definitely not fused with resorption of the bone graft and with collapse. Grade I and Grade II were defined as bone graft fusion in this study.
