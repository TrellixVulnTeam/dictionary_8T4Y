<p>The patient was placed in a prone position after general anesthesia, and a C-arm X-ray was used to locate the lesion segment. Bilateral paraspinal muscles were subperiosteal detached via a posterior median approach. For a unilateral TB lesion, an inter-muscular approach was applied as per our previous research (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The spinous process, lamina, articular, and transverse process of the lesion segment, and the adjacent normal vertebrae were all exposed. Then pedicle screws were implanted into one or two normal vertebrae above and below the lesion segment and the titanium rod was temporarily locked. Bilateral vertebral plates were resected to decompress the spinal canal, and caseous necrosis, intervertebral disc, and dead bone were all completely stricken off by different types of curette. Then, the proper pressure was applied to the posterior screw system to correct kyphosis and a C-arm X-ray was used to confirm the kyphosis correction. Then, bone grafting was performed: (a) Granular bone graft: harvest the vertebral plate, spinous process, and articular process and make them into 3â€“5 mm granular bone. Then implant the granular bone into the intervertebral space and tamp them down. Finally, put a gelatin sponge containing isoniazid to cover the posterior margin of the granular bone to prevent them from entering the spinal canal (

(b) Transverse processes bone graft: cut off one or two transverse processes of the adjacent segment and trim it to create a columnar cage with annular cortical bone on the sides and cancellous bone at both ends. Then implant it into the intervertebral space (
