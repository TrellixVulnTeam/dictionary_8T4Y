<p>To our knowledge, there are only a few reports of transverse processes bone grafts for repairing spinal TB bone defects so far. Anatomical studies show that the average length of the transverse process of the thoracic vertebra is 17.4 mm, thoracic vertebral height is 14.1–22.7 mm (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), and the height of the thoracic intervertebral disc is 2–6 mm (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). So when the destruction of the two adjacent vertebral bones is less than half of the vertebral body height, a transverse processes bone graft can meet the needs. Moreover, Thanapipatsiri and Chan (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) studied the relationship of the transverse process and its adjacent structures (including local blood vessels, nerve) and concluded that no important blood vessels, nerves, muscles, and tendons would be injured during the transverse process harvesting as long as the subperiosteal dissection was strictly followed with gentle movements. Located in the surgical segments of TB debridement and internal fixation, transverse processes are easy to expose and harvest and has little effect on spinal stability after resection (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and thus radical debridement, decompression, bone grafts, and internal fixation can be performed in only one incision, which reduces surgical trauma and shortens the operative time (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).
