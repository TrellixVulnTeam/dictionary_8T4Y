<p>At the last follow-up, the VAS score, ESR, CRP, and ASIA grade of the two groups were all significantly improved compared with preoperative measurements, this is due to the following reasons: (a) All patients received long-term and effective anti-TB chemotherapy (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). (b) Radical debridement of the TB lesion, effective decompression of spinal canal, correction of kyphosis, and rigid posterior internal fixation during the surgery (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). (c) Bone graft fusion was obtained in all patients at the last follow-up. In this study, the postoperative complications after spinal TB mainly included hepatic function damage, sinus formation, and pulmonary infection, which may be due to the long-term anti-TB chemotherapy, long hospital stay, and low immunity of TB patients. However, no difference in complication rate was found between the two groups, and all the complications were recovered through active treatment. This also indicated that both the granular bone graft and transverse process bone graft were safe in thoracic spinal TB surgery.
