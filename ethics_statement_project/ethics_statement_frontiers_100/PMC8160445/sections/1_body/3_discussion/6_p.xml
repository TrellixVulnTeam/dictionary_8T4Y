<p>In our opinion, the granular bone graft and transverse process bone graft have similar indications for single-segmental thoracic TB (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The indications were as follows: (a) Deterioration of neurological dysfunction or paralysis. (b) Progressive spinal instability or kyphosis deformity. (c) Single-segmental thoracic TB with vertebrae destruction &lt;50% of the vertebrae height. (d) The TB lesion was mainly in the former column and the posterior column was not involved. Transverse process bone grafts may be a good alternative method when the volume of granular bone is not enough to meet the requirements of intervertebral bone grafting in spinal TB surgery.
