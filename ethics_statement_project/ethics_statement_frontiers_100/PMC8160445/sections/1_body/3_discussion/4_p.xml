<p>In this study, we also found that the Cobb angle loss of the granular bone graft group was more obvious than that of the transverse process bone graft group during the follow-up, which may due to the potential disadvantages of granular bone such as smaller diameter, weak supporting force (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and ease in which it can be completely absorbed (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Although a granular bone graft is prone to Cobb angle loss after surgery, the loss was slight (&lt;3Â°), and our previous study already has concluded that mild Cobb angle loss after STB surgery did not affect bone graft fusion, spinal stability, and clinical symptoms (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). There was no significant difference between the granular bone graft and transverse bone graft in alleviating clinical symptoms and complications, and this may indirectly confirm the above views.
