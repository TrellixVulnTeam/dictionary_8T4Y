<p>This study found the bone graft fusion time of the granular bone graft was shorter than the transverse process bone graft, which may be related to the promoting osteogenesis effect of granular bone for the following reasons: (a) granular bone has a large contact area with the vertebral body and it is conducive for nutrient infiltrating and neovascularization growth (
