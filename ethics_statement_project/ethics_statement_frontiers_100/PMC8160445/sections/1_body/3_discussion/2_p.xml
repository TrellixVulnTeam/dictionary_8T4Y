<p>Previous studies found that both granular bone grafts and transverse process bone grafts have the advantages of shorter operation time and less intraoperative bleeding compared with iliac bone grafts and titanium mesh bone grafts (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). But no differences were found in operative time, operative blood loss, and hospital stay between the granular bone graft and transverse process bone graft. We thought this may be due to the following reasons: (a) Although the decompression, bone graft, and internal fixation could be done in one incision in the transverse process bone graft group, the bone grafting beds needed to be prepared (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and the harvested transverse process bone had to be trimmed to fit the size of the intervertebral space defect (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). (b) Although the granular bone is small and convenient to implant and does not have a high requirement for the condition of a bone grafting bed (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), surgeons still need to crush the lamina, and undergo the spinous process and articular process to make bone pellets (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). (c) Similar surgical trauma of the two groups may lead to no difference in the hospital stay.
