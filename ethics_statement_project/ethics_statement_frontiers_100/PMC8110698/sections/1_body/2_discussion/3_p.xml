<p>However, it is striking to note that 8 patients with an unusual infection (prosthetic infection), randomly chosen or consecutively treated for classical infection presentation present the same type of immune deficit. The analogy with animal models seems difficult to establish but it appears logical to think that partially missing or inefficient cells involved in immune response to an aggression by 
 <italic>Pasteurella</italic> spp. will favor infection. As in animal models, an increased CD8+ T lymphocytes count should be observed in humans, in reaction to bacterium. However, it is only possible if these cells are sufficient in number and with the possibility to react. Unfortunately, we were not able to challenge CD8+ T cells of patients with their bacterial strain, to observe an activation of these latter.
