<p>Although pathogenicity of 
 <italic>P. multocida</italic> relies on several virulence factors among which its capsule, adhesins or toxins (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), immunity against 
 <italic>Pasteurella</italic> spp. is not well-known in humans (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Antibody secretion was demonstrated against capsular and somatic antigens, however its real impact is not well-established (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In veterinary medicine an increase of CD8+ T lymphocytes after a challenge with 
 <italic>P. multocida</italic> has been demonstrated (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These studies were performed with lung infection models in three different types of animals: swine (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), calves (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and pigs (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These studies indicate that at least concerning animals, the inflammatory response is mediated via lymphocytes activation and particularly CD8 + T cells.
