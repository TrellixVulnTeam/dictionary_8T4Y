 <italic>P. multocida</italic> is the most commonly isolated pathogen after dogs or cats' bites; however it is unusual to develop an infection. Nevertheless, it is difficult to assess whether people are not infected because of their immune system (efficient CD8+ T lymphocytes for example) or because of local treatment, antibiotics or the absence of such bacteria in animals' mouth.
