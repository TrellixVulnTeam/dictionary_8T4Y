<p>In conclusion, we are aware that this study does not demonstrate the link between T CD8+ lymphocytes deficit and the occurrence of infection with 
 <italic>Pasteurella</italic> spp., but our observations question the nature of immunity against 
 <italic>Pasteurella</italic> spp. and the likely role of CD8+ T cell lymphocytes. Yet, other studies will be necessary to understand whether only people with a deficit can develop such an infection and to study the exact role of CD8+ T lymphocytes. However, such a study is difficult as many factors are involved such as antibiotic use before cares and bacteriological samples, the presence/absence of the bacteria in animals' mouth and its transmission.
