  <bold>Background:</bold> Immunity against 
  <italic>Pasteurella</italic> spp. is not well-known for humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Methods:</bold> We've tested T CD8+ lymphocytes in a patient with a chronic prosthetic joint infection due to 
  <italic>Pasteurella</italic> spp. to search for a deficit which could have favored her infection. As this deficit was found, we've searched for such a deficit in other patients with 
  <italic>Pasteurella</italic> spp. Infections, either acute or subacute.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Results:</bold> Eight patients were tested and all had a persistent T CD8+ lymphocytes deficit. This is striking as these cells are involved in the response to this type of infection in animal models.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Conclusion:</bold> The authors suggest that a deficit in CD8+ T lymphocytes can be one of the causes for the onset of infections with 
  <italic>P. multocida</italic>.
