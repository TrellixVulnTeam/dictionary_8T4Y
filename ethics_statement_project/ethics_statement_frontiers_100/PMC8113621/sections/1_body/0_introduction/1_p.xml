<p>Primitive neuroendodermal tumors (PNETs) are small round-cell malignancies originating from the neural crest. PNETs can occur at any age but are most common among adolescents and adults under the age of 35 (

PNETs arise more frequently in the bone and soft tissue and are very rare in other parts of the body. However, there have been reports of PNETs in the kidney, liver, urinary bladder, myocardium, adrenal glands, pancreas, and female genital tract (

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) first reported a PNET that occurred in the chest, which is currently referred to as Askin's tumor. However, cases of pulmonary PNETs without chest wall or pleural involvement are extremely rare worldwide. Herein, we report a case of a large pulmonary PNET in an adult female who gave birth just 1 month prior to the diagnosis.
