<p>The patient received preventive antibiotic and supportive treatments after the operation. The chest tube was removed on the fourth day after the operation. Postoperative pathology confirmed that the tumor was a small round-cell malignancy with a cross-section of 12 × 11 cm. The tumor was adjacent to the visceral pleura, and a bronchial tangent and nodes were not found in the tumor. One of the lymph nodes showed extensive necrosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the tumor cells were positive for creatine kinase (CK), Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI-1), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), CD99, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). The cell proliferative index (KI-67) was ~50%. The tumor cells were negative for cytokeratin 7, P40, thyroid transcription factor-1, CD56, chromogranin A, vimentin, CD30, CD43, α-inhibin, myeloperoxidase, S-100, and CD138 (
