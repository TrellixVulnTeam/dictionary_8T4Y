<p>During surgery, the left lower lobe of the lung was found to have adhered to the thoracic cavity, and a hard mass involving the entire left lower lobe and inferior pulmonary veins was present, without metastatic nodules in the pleura. To excise the upper and lower pulmonary veins, we opened the pericardium and successfully resected the total left lung and cleaned the 4, 5, 7, 9, and 10th nodes (

The bleeding volume was 500 mL, with a 400-mL blood transfusion. The operation lasted for ~4 h. Because the patient was young and not at risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases before the operation, she was directly transferred to the general ward after operation.
