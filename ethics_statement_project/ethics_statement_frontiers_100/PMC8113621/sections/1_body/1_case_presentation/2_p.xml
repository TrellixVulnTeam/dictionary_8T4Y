<p>Physical examination revealed that the breath sounds in the left lung field were weakened. Laboratory studies showed that her white blood cell count was 12.4 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L; the hemoglobin level was 97 g/L; and the platelet count was 555 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L. D-dimer level was 8.37 mg/L. Tumor marker analysis showed that the squamous cell carcinoma antigen had increased to 3.4 ng/mL, and her CYFRA211 level had increased to 90.2 ng/mL. Pulmonary function test showed maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) was 67.98 L, accounting for 63.1% of the predicted value; forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) 2.09 L, accounting for 72.3% of the predicted value. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans revealed a large soft tissue mass in the lower left lobe of the lung; the maximum cross-section was ~11.7 × 15.4 cm. The density of the mass was uneven and showed inner crumb calcifications. The solid parts of the mass were enhanced with moderate heterogeneity. The bronchus of the lower lobe of the left lung was truncated. The bilateral axillary lymph nodes were enlarged, and multiple enlarged lymph nodes were observed in the left hilus of the lung. Pleural effusion was observed on the left side of the chest cavity. CT results are considered as left lower lobe tumor with mediastinal and left hilar lymphadenopathy. Chest radiography showed a patchy shadow in the lower lobe of the left lung. The left hilus of the lung was expanded, and there was a left pleural effusion.
