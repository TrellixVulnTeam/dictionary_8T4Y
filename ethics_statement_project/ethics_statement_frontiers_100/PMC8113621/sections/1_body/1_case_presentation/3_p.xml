<p>To identify the location and the type of the tumor, a bronchoscopic examination was performed. Bronchoscopy showed that the basal segment of the lower lobe of the left lung was entirely blocked by a tumor, which had a cauliflower-like appearance. The remaining bronchial mucosa of the lower lobe of the left lung was slightly congested, and the ridge was widened. Brush detection revealed a few cells with large bodies, arranged in groups, which is may be considered as lung cancer. A bone scan and abdominal ultrasonography showed no metastases, and the cardiopulmonary function of the patient was adequate; therefore, we performed surgery. The patient provided informed consent and signed the consent form.</p>
