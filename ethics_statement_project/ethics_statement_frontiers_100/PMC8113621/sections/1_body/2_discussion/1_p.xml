 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Until now, only few pulmonary PNETs have been reported in the literature (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Common clinical manifestations include chest pain, cough, and fever. CT scans often detect large lumps. Our case was mainly characterized by cough and chest pain; the tumor diameter, as shown by CT, was ~12 cm.
