<p>Currently, the most commonly used chemotherapy drugs to treat PNETs include cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, etoposide, and ifosfamide (

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) reported a patient who was treated with thalidomide because of the poor effect of conventional therapy and who was in a good condition, without disease progression for 15 months. To date, no successful pneumonectomy of such a large pulmonary PNET has been reported. Our patient underwent radical tumor excision and lymph node dissection. However, because of financial problems, she did not receive follow-up chemoradiotherapy and was discharged 7 days after the surgery in good condition. For large pulmonary PNETs, pneumonectomy may be a safe surgical method, worthy of further application in clinical practice.
