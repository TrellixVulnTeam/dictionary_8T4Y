<p>Pulmonary PNETs have no specific symptoms or imaging manifestations, and the diagnosis mainly relies on pathological and immunohistochemical findings or genetic techniques. Pathologically, PNETs are composed of differentiated or poorly differentiated small, blue, round cells that are diffuse, leaf-shaped, or nested and separated by fibrous vessels. Necrosis, hemorrhage, and cystic changes often occur. Some tumor tissues can be observed in the Homer–Wright or Flexner–Weinsteiner structure. PNETs are often strongly positive for CD99, which is a cell-surface glycoprotein encoded by the heterochromatin 
 <italic>CD99</italic> gene (also known as 
 <italic>MIC2</italic>) (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In addition, studies have found that NSE, CD56, and vimentin can be present at different levels (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and that the FLI-1 protein may also be of great value in diagnosing PNETs (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). At least two of these markers should be positive to diagnose a tumor as a PNET (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Genetic diagnosis involves the detection of the 
 <italic>t</italic>(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation, which is present in 90–95% of PNET cases (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Our case was positive for CD99, FLI-1, and NSE. No tumor was discovered elsewhere, and therefore, the diagnosis was a pulmonary PNET.
