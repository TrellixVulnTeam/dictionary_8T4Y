<p>Variable numbers of columnar epithelial cells of the respiratory tract were present on all slides and are part of the normal collected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). They occur singly or in palisading arrangements. They have a round, basal nucleus, with fine chromatin. Their cytoplasm is lightly basophilic and, when well-preserved, cilia can be observed on the apical border.
