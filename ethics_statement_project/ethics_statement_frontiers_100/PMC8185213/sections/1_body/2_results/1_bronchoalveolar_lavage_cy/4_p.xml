<p>Lymphocytes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) were the second most represented population. They are small round cells with a high nucleocytoplasmic ratio. The nucleus contains dense chromatin. The cytoplasm is scant and usually reduced to a one-side crescent. However, it is important to check for the presence of cytoplasm to avoid counting naked nuclei as lymphocytes.
