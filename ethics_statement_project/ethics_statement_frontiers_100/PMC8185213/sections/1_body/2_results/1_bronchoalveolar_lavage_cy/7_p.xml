<p>A single macaque exhibited a single mastocyte in its BAL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Mastocytes are round cells with an unsegmented, round to ovoid nucleus. The cytoplasm is moderately abundant and filled with azurophilic granules. With May-Gr√ºnwald Giemsa staining, the granules frequently obscure the nucleus. With the modified Giemsa stain, granules typically appear faint. This data was not included in statistics.
