<p>Neutrophils (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>) and eosinophils (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2B,C</xref>) may be difficult to differentiate in macaques, as neutrophils contain pale pink granules in their cytoplasm. However, eosinophils have more distinct, roundish, and brighter pink granules. Also, neutrophils usually exhibit multiple segmentation whereas eosinophils are more often bilobed. Rare unsegmented eosinophils were also observed.
