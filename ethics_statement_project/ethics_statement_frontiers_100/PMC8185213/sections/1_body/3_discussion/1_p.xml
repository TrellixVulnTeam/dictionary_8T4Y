<p>This study proposes reference intervals for BAL fluid differential cell counts, generated from 30 healthy female cynomolgus macaques. Alveolar macrophage was the predominant cell type to be identified, with a reference interval percentage between 55.8 and 93.7%. Lymphocytes were comprised between 1.8 and 37.1%, neutrophils between 0.4 and 8.7%, and eosinophils between 0.4 and 9.8%.</p>
