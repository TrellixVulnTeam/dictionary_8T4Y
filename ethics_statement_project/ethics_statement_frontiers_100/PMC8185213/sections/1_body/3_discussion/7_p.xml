<p>Of note, the homogeneity of the macaque population investigated in our study could introduce a bias. Indeed, the reference sample group is composed exclusively of females of approximately the same age. Females are easier to handle and as such represent a significant subset in preclinical studies. We, therefore, considered our macaque population as representative of middle-age specimens investigated in most preclinical studies. However, a specific study would be interesting to investigate the effect of gender on BAL composition.</p>
