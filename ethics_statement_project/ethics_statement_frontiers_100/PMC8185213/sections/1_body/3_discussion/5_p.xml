<p>In the present study, we took advantage of the presence of both, non-contaminated and slightly contaminated samples (blood and oropharyngeal contaminants)—which from our experience reflects reality—to evaluate the impact of such contaminations on differential cell counts. As expected, our results provide further evidence that these minor contaminations do not impact differential results in an extent that would alter clinical interpretation. Still, statistically significant differences were observed in macrophage and lymphocyte percentages with the presence or absence of blood. Because lymphocytes are the predominant nucleated blood cells in macaques, the higher lymphocyte percentage in blood-contaminated samples was primarily attributed to the blood contamination. However, subtle lymphocytic inflammation, resulting in increased fragility of capillaries and increased susceptibility for hemorrhage, cannot be formally excluded. We believe that it is preferable not to hemolyze to assess the extent of blood contamination.</p>
