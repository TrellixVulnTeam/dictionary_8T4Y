<p>The purpose of the present study was therefore to establish further reference values and to document an atlas from healthy cynomolgus macaques to provide a practical base for further research on respiratory tract disorders and related BAL modifications. This would include understanding the inflammatory response upon exposure to a respiratory pathogen, as the increase of certain cell types in BAL can predict the severity of the disease or the clearance of the pathogen, or even the risk of disease enhancement after vaccination (e.g., Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Coronavirus, etc.) (
