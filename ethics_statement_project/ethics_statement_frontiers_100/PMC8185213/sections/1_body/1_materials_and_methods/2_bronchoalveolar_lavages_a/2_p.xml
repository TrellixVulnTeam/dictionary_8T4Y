<p>BAL fluids were collected in 15 mL-tubes (Falcon) and were placed at 4°C until staining (less than 1 h). Tubes were centrifuged at 400 x g for 7 min at 4°C to pellet cells and mucus. BAL pellets were resuspended with 20 μL of PBS to prepare smear slides. Slides were stained with a commercially available modified Giemsa stain (Differential Quik Stain Kit - Polysciences). Following the coloration steps, the slides were rinsed in distilled water, quickly dehydrated in 100% EtOH, and dipped in methylcyclohexane before being mounted with a synthetic resin.</p>
