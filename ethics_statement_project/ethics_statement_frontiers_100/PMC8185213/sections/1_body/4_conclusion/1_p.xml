<p>This study provides a useful baseline for the assessment of BAL cytological data in cynomolgus macaques. Before differential cell count, it is advised to assess the sample for the presence of blood and oropharyngeal contamination. This study also indicates that a few superficial squamous cells and up to 10 RBCs/field at objective 100X can be tolerated.</p>
