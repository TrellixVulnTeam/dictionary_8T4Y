<p>Clinical utility denotes the ability to combine different sources of knowledge to find the optimal treatment in real-life settings. In addition, clinical utility includes economic factors. Leaving economic factors aside, it should be clear that that the definition of an optimal real-world treatment is by no means straightforward. There is a large number of fact and value entanglements in psychotherapy practice making the notion of utility equivocal. Clinical practice concerns itself with the unique individual patient. The most relevant question when facing an individual is whether one has the knowledge, skill and resources to help that very individual. If the clinician has knowledge about effects that do not pertain to that very individual, lack the skill to convert knowledge into practice and/or do not have the resources to provide the treatment, knowledge about a given form of treatment is irrelevant. In that sense, knowledge about treatment efficacy qua treatment efficacy is useless for clinical practice. It is useful if and only if it leads to clinical utility. Thus, insofar that evidence-based practice in psychology aims at regulating psychotherapy
