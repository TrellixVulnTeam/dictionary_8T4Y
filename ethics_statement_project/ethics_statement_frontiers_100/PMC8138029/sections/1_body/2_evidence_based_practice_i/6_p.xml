<p>If randomised controlled trials are preferred for evaluating treatment efficacy for specific interventions, the notion of specific intervention in psychotherapy needs clarification. A specific intervention is not the same as a specific technique (e.g., exposure-therapy or behavioural experiment) (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Horvath et al., 2011</xref>), the intervention is specific, but it does not necessarily involve a specific technique. If every intervention with a given aim is defined a specific intervention, most therapist interventions are indeed specific. It follows that the evidence-hierarchy applies to every therapeutic action, in the widest sense of the word. Thus, randomised controlled trials are preferred to indicate efficacy. Consequently, randomised controlled trials are as dominant in evidence-based practice in psychology as in evidence-based medicine, only with the disadvantage of being dominant in a somewhat opaque manner.
