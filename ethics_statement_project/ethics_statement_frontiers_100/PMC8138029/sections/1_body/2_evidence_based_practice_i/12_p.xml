<p>The proper understanding of efficiency comes with a major caveat. The sound use of scientific research in psychotherapy practice depends on the conceptualisation of psychotherapy. The propositions of psychotherapy research are value-laden and the various psychotherapy schools and interventions merges with ethics (

As an example, the normative aim of existential psychotherapy differs from that of cognitive-behavioural therapy. Any consideration of research findings for clinical practice has to take this facet of psychotherapy into consideration. Empirical research cannot determine the nature of the good. The good and the right are the subjects of normative ethics. Thus, there is an inherent and principal limitation in scientific research when informing psychotherapy practice.
