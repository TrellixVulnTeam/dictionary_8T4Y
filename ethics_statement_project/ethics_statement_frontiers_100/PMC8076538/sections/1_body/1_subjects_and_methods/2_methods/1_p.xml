<p>oVEMP were measured using the Eclipse system (Interacoustics, Middelfart, Denmark). Active electrodes were placed just beneath the lower eyelid while a reference electrode was placed on the chin. The ground electrode was placed on the nasion. Tone bursts (500 Hz, rise/fall time: 2 ms, plateau time: 2 ms, and 70 dB nHL) were presented at a rate of 5.1 Hz using a B81 bone conduction transducer (Radioear, New Eagle, USA). The bone conduction transducer was fitted with the standard steel spring headband and placed on the area just anterior to the helix at the level of the eyes. For the recordings obtained beneath the right (left) eye, the bone-vibrator was placed on the preauricular area on the opposite side to the recording site. Placement of the transducer was performed to be symmetrical as accurately as possible. One hundred responses were bandpass-filtered (10â€“1,000 Hz) and averaged. During the recordings, the subjects were asked to maintain a 20-degree upward gaze. To confirm the reproducibility of the results, two runs were performed for each ear. The N1-P1 amplitude was measured, and the mean of two runs was used. In addition to the recordings obtained without occlusion of the external auditory meatus, recordings involving occlusion of the external auditory meatus, which was achieved using an earplug made of urethane foam, were obtained. Recordings with and without occlusion were performed in random order. Insertion and removal of an earplug were performed without touching the transducer. The placement site was chosen to enable an examiner to insert or remove an earplug without touching the transducer.</p>
