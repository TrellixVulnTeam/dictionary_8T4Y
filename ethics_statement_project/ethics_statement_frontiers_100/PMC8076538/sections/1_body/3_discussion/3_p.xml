<p>As for the patients with vestibular disease, 4 of the 14 patients showed no oVEMP responses on either side in the recordings obtained without occlusion. Among them, two patients showed unilateral responses and two patients demonstrated bilateral responses in the recordings obtained with occlusion. In other words, the bilateral absence of oVEMP responses in tests performed without occlusion seems to be a false positive. These results suggest that occluding the external ear canal improves the reliability of oVEMP testing performed using the B81 bone conduction transducer.</p>
