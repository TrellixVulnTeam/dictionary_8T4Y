<p>The fact that occluding the external auditory meatus lowers the hearing threshold for BC sound has been known as the occlusion effect since the 19th century (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). As 500-Hz tone bursts are usually used for recording VEMP, occlusion of the external ear canal seems to be beneficial for inducing VEMP responses although it depends on the mechanism underlying the occlusion effect.
