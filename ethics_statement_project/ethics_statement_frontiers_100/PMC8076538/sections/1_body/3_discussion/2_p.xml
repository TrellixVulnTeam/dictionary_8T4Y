<p>The site of the stimulator is very important for recording of oVEMP. Therefore, we tried to place it on the same place as accurately as possible. The site of the B81 bone conduction transducer is different from the usual site. This place was chosen to do all recording without touching the transducer. The site of the reference electrode is also unusual. It is due to the limitation of the device. However, these factors will not affect the results of this study, the superiority of BC oVEMP with occlusion to without occlusion.</p>
