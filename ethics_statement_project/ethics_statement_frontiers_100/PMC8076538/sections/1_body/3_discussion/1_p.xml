<p>This preliminary study showed that occlusion of the external auditory meatus produced a significant increase in the N1-P1 amplitudes of BC oVEMP recorded with the B81 in healthy subjects. The standard error (deviation) of N1-P1 amplitude obtained with occlusion was smaller than that obtained without occlusion. These findings mean that performing oVEMP tests with occlusion results in a narrower normal range than conducting them without occlusion. Large SE (SD) would be due to unclear (almost absent) responses. This would probably lead to an improvement in the sensitivity of such testing.</p>
