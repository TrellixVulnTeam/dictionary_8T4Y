<p>There are some limitations in this study. This is a small-sized pilot study. The significance of the external auditory meatus should be confirmed in a larger study. Then, the relationship between the site of BC stimulation and the extent of occlusion effect should be also investigated because the stie of BC stimulation has large effects for amplitudes (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Then, the occlusion effect in midline stimulation will be investigated. Asymmetry of occlusion might have some effects. This point should be also studied in the future study.
