<p>We assumed that occlusion of the external auditory meatus using an earplug could also facilitate the recording of BC oVEMP induced using bone conduction transducers, such as the B71 and B81. Although the outputs produced by the B81 are stronger than those produced by the B71 (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), they are not always sufficient to produce stable oVEMP responses. The preliminary results of the current study support our assumption. It might be beneficial to add occlusion of the external auditory meatus to the protocol for BC oVEMP recordings performed using the B81.
