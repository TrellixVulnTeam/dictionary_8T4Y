<p>Rotem Betito et al. (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and Handzel and Himmelfarb (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) reported that external auditory meatus occlusion improved the BC cVEMP responses of healthy subjects. Rotem Betito et al. also found that the effect of occlusion on BC cVEMP was not observed in ears filled with water, but was seen in ears that had been occluded using earplugs. This suggests that earplugs may prevent bone vibrator-induced sound pressure in the external auditory meatus from escaping and reinforce the sound pressure transmitted to the inner ear.
