<p>It is known that occluding the external auditory meatus lowers the hearing threshold for bone-conducted sound. This is known as the occlusion effect (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The occlusion of the external auditory meatus improves hearing thresholds by 10â€“20 dB at frequencies of 250 and 500 Hz (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Therefore, occluding the external auditory meatus might improve VEMP responses. Handzel and Himmelfarb (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) reported that cVEMP responses could be augmented by occlusion. We applied this method to oVEMP recording in order to obtain stable oVEMP responses using the B81.
