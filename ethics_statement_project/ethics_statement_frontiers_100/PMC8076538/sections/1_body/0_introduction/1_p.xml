<p>At present, two types of vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP) are examined in the clinical setting. The first is cervical VEMP (cVEMP), which are recorded in the sternocleidomastoid muscle in order to test saccular function. The other is ocular VEMP (oVEMP), which are recorded beneath the lower eyelid in order to test utricular function (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), recording oVEMP using ACS is harder. For this reason, bone-conducted vibrations (BCV) have been used to record oVEMP (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). A mini-shaker (BK4810) is widely utilized to induce BCV. However, it is heavy and hard to calibrate accurately. The B71 conventional bone conduction transducer (RadioEar) was tried as an alternative. However, the output of the B71 is not always sufficient to for measuring oVEMP responses (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). A new bone conduction transducer, the B81 (RadioEar), has recently become available. The B81 has a higher output than the B71 (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Although the B81 evokes better responses than the B71, the associated oVEMP responses are still unstable. Therefore, some ingenuity is required to obtain stable oVEMP responses using the B81.
