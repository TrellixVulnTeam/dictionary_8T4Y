  <p>An example of the responses of a vestibular patient (a 36-year-old female, right probable Meniere's disease). Although oVEMP responses without occlusion were not clear enough, the recording obtained with occlusion showed clear reproducible responses on the left side stimulation. No response was obtained on the right side stimulation even with occlusion. Recording to the right (left) side stimulation was performed beneath the left (right) eye.</p>
