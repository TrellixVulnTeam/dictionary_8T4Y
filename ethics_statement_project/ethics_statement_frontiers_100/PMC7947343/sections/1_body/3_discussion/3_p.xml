<p>Values are gradually established over an individual's lifetime as he or she accumulates knowledge and life experiences, but once the individual's values have been established, they provide a certain level of stability, producing set value orientations and behaviors that are difficult to change. Evidently, when an individual possesses both Machiavellianism and ethical values simultaneously, for a time he or she will hold conflicting values before a stable value system is established and re-prioritization occurs, and therefore internal conflicts are inevitable.</p>
