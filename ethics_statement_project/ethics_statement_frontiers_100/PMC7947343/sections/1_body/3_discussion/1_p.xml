<p>Machiavellianism is not only a personality trait, it is a value. It can affect one's relationship with others, happiness, and psychological well-being (Aghababaei and BÅ‚achnio, 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). When faced with a dilemma involving value conflicts between Machiavellianism and ethical values, individuals will experience inner conflict, which manifests as an increase in anxiety. Ethical values also increase levels of anxiety. However, there is one other interpretation of our results: moral dilemmas are more distressing for those who do not have clear ethical values (i.e., who do not have a strong moral identity paired with low Machiavellianism). This is a very interesting hypothesis that needs to be examined in future studies.
