<p>We further investigated the interactive effects of Machiavellianism and ethical values using ANOVAs. The results revealed that among participants with low ethical values, the STAI levels of participants with high levels of Machiavellianism (
 <italic>M</italic> = 14.00) were not significantly different from those with low levels of Machiavellianism (
 <italic>M</italic> = 13.10) [
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>(1,111)</sub> = 0.82, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.368]. However, among participants with strong ethical values, the STAI levels of those with high levels of Machiavellianism (
 <italic>M</italic> = 13.71) were significantly higher than those with low levels of Machiavellianism (
 <italic>M</italic> = 10.91) [
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>(1,111)</sub> = 13.79, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001]. In other words, for participants with strong ethical values, their psychological stress or anxiety increased as their level of Machiavellianism increased, while participants with weaker ethical values did not experience such an effect. Therefore, this evidence supports hypothesis H3.
