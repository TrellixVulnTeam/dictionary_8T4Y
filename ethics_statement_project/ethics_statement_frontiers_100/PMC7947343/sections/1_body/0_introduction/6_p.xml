<p>Schwartz (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>) identified 10 types of values, namely hedonism, achievement, power, stimulation, self-direction, universalism, benevolence, tradition, conformity, and security, which he placed within a circumplex model. These value types were partitioned and arranged according to two broader categories: self-enhancement vs. self-transcendence (self-directed vs. other-directed) and openness to change vs. conservation. In this model, adjacent value types are mutually complementary and harmonizing, while those situated opposite from each other have opposing and conflicting relations. Schwartz's circumplex model of values clearly depicts the structural relationships between the various types of values, as can be seen in
