<p>There is no consensus on the definition of NSCLC-to-SCLC transformation and its differences from primary SCLC. In our two patients, the initial biopsy showed no neuroendocrine features, and histological findings in favor of SCLC were found on re-biopsy, which was prompted by radiological signs of disease progression. Two independent pathologists reviewed the pathological sections. The histological transformation of lung adenocarcinoma to SCLC has been found in 3–14% of patients treated with EGFR-TKIs (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, there are only a few published cases of histological transformation to SCLC in patients receiving PD-1 inhibitors, and retrospective studies are lacking. Sehgal and Imakita reported disease progression in a patient who received nivolumab monotherapy as second-line therapy; re-biopsy showed transformation to SCLC (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). lams reported that transformation to SCLC could be a mechanism of resistance to nivolumab in KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Similarly, histological transformation to SCLC has also been reported with pembrolizumab therapy (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).
