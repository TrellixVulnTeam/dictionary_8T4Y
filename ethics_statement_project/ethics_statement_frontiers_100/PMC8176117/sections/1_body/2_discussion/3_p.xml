<p>In conclusion, we reported two cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, which transformed to SCLC during immunotherapy with PD-1 inhibitors. Phenotypic transformation to SCLC is a potential mechanism of resistance to immunotherapy in squamous cell carcinomas of the lung. Clinicians should be aware of this transformation and consider re-biopsy after PD-1 therapy for NSCLC, especially in patients with disease progression.</p>
