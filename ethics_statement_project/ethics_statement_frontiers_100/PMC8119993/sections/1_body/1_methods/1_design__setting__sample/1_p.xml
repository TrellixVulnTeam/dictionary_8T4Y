<p>We developed and administered a cross-sectional online survey targeting international IS experts and invited a purposive sample of 56 from Australia, Europe, and North America to participate.

Since implementation scientists are disproportionately concentrated in the US and Europe, we included experts with guidance from the articles' authors, to ensure international geographic representation and balance the sample to the extent possible. While there are many complementary disciplines, e.g., improvement science, our research objective focused specifically on identifying IS literature. Therefore, we engaged experts working specifically in IS. The reporting of this study adhered to the STROBE Statement as well as the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-surveys (CHERRIES) (
