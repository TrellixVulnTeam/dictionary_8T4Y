<p>Since IS rapidly develops, terminology evolves and further journals will arise. Our approach to access relevant IS evidence should be further developed or alternative approaches considered. Testing those approaches against each other will help to quantify differences in effectivity. As subjectively derived search strings (expert based) are often prone to methodological criticism, the development of objectively derived search strategies (research based) could be an alternative approach to identify IS journals (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). This approach entails a four-step process: first, a subset of IS journals is generated, of which a search strategy is developed in a second step to identify this subset journals. Third, the developed search strategy is validated against a validation set containing different journals and finally the process is documented (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). However, key for developing empirical search strings is the availability of papers relevant to the studied topic in order to achieve sufficient sensitivity (close to 90%).
