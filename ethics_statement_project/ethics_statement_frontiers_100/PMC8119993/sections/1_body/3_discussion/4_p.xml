<p>Another challenge in identifying IS-relevant evidence is the heterogeneity and fragmentation of IS across research fields and disciplines which is highlighted by the variation of journals identified in our survey (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Our experts also noted and reflected on this, as evidenced by their comments and journal recommendations. As IS is inherently multidisciplinary, articles can be published in diverse journals and databases. This is reflected in the wide and growing range of journals publishing special IS issues. This heterogeneity and rapidly increasing complexity are not only major challenges to IS researchers, but indicators of the barriers other clinical researchers also encounter daily in their fields. And if these challenges impede researchers' access to effective evidence, then the first crucial step of research—identification of that evidence—is impossible.
