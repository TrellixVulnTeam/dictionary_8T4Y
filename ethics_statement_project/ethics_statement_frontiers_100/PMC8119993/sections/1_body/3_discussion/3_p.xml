 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), providing an overview of the 20 journals in which researchers focusing on dissemination and implementation most frequently found IS articles. Of Norton et al.'s 20 journals, 13 were also considered relevant by this study's experts (

Our study shows that some studies' perceived relevance depends on the experts' geographical location, which might be related to geographic differences in IS operationalization.
