<p>Challenges in developing precise IS search strings are also described in other systematic reviews (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and similar to our own experience in an ongoing mapping review project, the ImplemeNtation science State of research ProjECT (INSPECT) (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). INSPECT involves a group of experts in nursing, health services research, implementation science, public health and health policy who guided the formation of an extensive search string intended to capture the existing status of IS as a scientific discipline. In contrast to previous work, this INSPECT concerns the total IS literature identified through our search string. However, similar to prior reviews, the INSPECT project is affected by limited sensitivity and specificity which challenges the identification of relevant IS literature.
