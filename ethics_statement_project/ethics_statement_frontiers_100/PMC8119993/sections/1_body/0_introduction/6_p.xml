<p>In order to access relevant IS literature published before 2019 (and probably also after until some congruence in labeling is adopted internationally), a more targeted approach is needed. One pragmatic step in this targeted direction is to compile a list of relevant journals for IS search strategies, which will help to narrow the search. Further, as studies in various fields have demonstrated that articles published in special issues are often published more quickly and with higher impact (citation rate per article) than regular articles, (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) these special issues might be particularly useful to help identify relevant evidence.
