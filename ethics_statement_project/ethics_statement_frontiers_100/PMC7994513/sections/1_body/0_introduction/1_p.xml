<p>Thyroid metastases from breast cancer are unusual, accounting for less than 0.2% of thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). It is well known that the most frequent distant metastases of breast cancer are bone and visceral organs (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Generally, the common origins of thyroid metastases seem to be breast cancer and lung cancer in autopsy cases (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, in clinical cases, the most common primary site is the kidney, followed by the breast (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Recently, with the advent of advanced diagnostic methods such as FNAB and immunohistochemistry (IHC), thyroid metastases have been reported increasingly. Although FNAB can help evaluate benign and malignant thyroid lesions, it may be inefficient in differentiating metastatic thyroid lesion by FNAB.
