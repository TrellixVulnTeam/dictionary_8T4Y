<p>It has been documented that immunohistochemical stains can play a critical role in differentiating between thyroid metastases and primary thyroid cancer (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). As noted, primary differentiated thyroid cancer commonly is TG, TTF-1 and PAX8 positive (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Calcitonin, involved in the parafollicular cells, is associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In contrast, above immunohistochemical markers were negative for thyroid metastases (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). On the other hand, considering the history of breast cancer, the immunoprofile of breast cancer such as ER, PR, HER2, GATA3, and GCDFP15, should be used to confirm the origin from breast cancer metastasis. Previous studies have demonstrated that GATA3 and GCDFP15 expression were positively associated with breast carcinoma and breast cancer metastasis (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). GATA3 is superior to GCDFP15 in determining the breast origin (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Ghias et al. (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) reported that thyroid metastases cells were positive for ER, GATA3, and were negative for GCDFP, TTF-1, TG, and calcitonin. Similar result is also observed in our case. Bourcier et al. (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) showed thyroid metastases from the breast cancer was positive for ER, PR, and GATA3, but negative for HER2, TTF-1, PAX8, and calcitonin. In additon, GATA-3 (+), ER (+), PAX-8 (-), and TTF-1(-) in thyroid metastases cells were reported by Magers et al. (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).
