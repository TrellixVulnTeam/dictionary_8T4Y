<p>To the best of our knowledge, the thyroid is an uncommon site of metastatic cancer. This may be attributed to the fast blood flow of thyroid, abundant oxygen and iodine (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The incidence of thyroid metastases ranges from 1.25% to 24% in autopsy studies (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). But the incidence of thyroid metastases was lower in clinical series than autopsy studies (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). It has been demonstrated that breast was the secondly frequent primary cancer site for thyroid metastases (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Currently, the etiology of thyroid metastases from primary carcinoma is not clarified. One study speculated that decreased oxygen and iodine resulted by local thyroid diseases (i.e., thyroiditis and goiter) may contribute to the genesis of thyroid metastases (
