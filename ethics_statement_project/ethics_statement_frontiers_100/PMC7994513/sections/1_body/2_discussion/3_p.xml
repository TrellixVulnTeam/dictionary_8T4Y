<p>Cytologic examination using FNAB is highly sensitive and specific in demonstrating a malignant thyroid nodule. But it is sometimes difficult to show the origin of the metastatic cancer (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Owens et al. (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) reported that FNAB of thyroid metastases from breast cancer demonstrated malignant epithelial cells with enlarged nuclei and irregular nuclear contours, but in the absence of intranuclear grooves and pseudoinclusions. Magers et al. (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) found that metastatic thyroid cancer from breast cancer can cytologically and morphologically mimic primary thyroid cancer on FNAB. Additionally, metastatic breast cancer cells in the thyroid, which mimicked C cell hyperplasia and medullary thyroid carcinoma, were observed in the case of Ghias et al. (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In our case, FNAB of thyroid showed malignant cells with enlarged nuclei.
