<p>The clinical presentation of thyroid metastases from breast cancer were similar to primary thyroid cancer, such as no symptoms, palpable neck mass, thyroid lesions detected on imaging examination and compression symptoms. Some studies reported that patients with thyroid metastases from breast cancer were symptomless and presented malignant thyroid nodules by ultrasound (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Similar clinical manifestations were reported by Owens et al. (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and Pensabene et al. (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In our case, the patient also presented no symptoms related to the thyroid disease. Other studies showed patients with thyroid metastases from breast cancer demonstrated dysphagia and dyspnea (

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In addition, the US features of thyroid metastases from breast cancer are not specific. Zhou et al. (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) reported that six patients showed heterogeneous echogenicity with scattered microcalcification, and two patients had hypoechoic solid nodule on US. Pensabene et al. (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) reported that one case showed enlarged thyroid with thyroid nodules on US. Similar thyroid nodule on US was reported by Magers et al. (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), Lacka et al. (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and Owens et al. (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Above US features also seen in our case and have been described previously. Therefore, there are no specific properties that clinically distinguish thyroid metastases from primary thyroid cancer.
