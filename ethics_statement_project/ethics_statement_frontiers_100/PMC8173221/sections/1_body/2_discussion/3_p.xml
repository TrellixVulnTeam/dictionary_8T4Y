<p>Two kind of separations could be performed in Area Iâ€”i.e., the rectus abdominis and posterior sheath, and the posterior sheath and peritoneum. The peritoneum is usually extremely thin and adheres tightly to and could not be separated from the posterior sheath. However, we attempted to confirm that the space between the peritoneum and posterior sheath can be separated, thus laying a foundation for TEP repair of parastomal hernia. The long midline incision on the abdomen in patients with a history of abdominal surgery makes it difficult to separate the peritoneum, which must be opened for the operation. Additionally, an open peritoneum allows observation of the intestine within the abdominal cavity, which can reduce the risk of accidental injury. Most hospitals have been able to implement laparoscopic transperineal rectal cancer surgery to reduce the use of abdominal incisions; this facilitates the creation of the extraperitoneal space and reduces the difficulty of the operation.</p>
