<p>An intraperitoneal approach is typically used in laparoscopic parastomal hernia repair surgery, which involves the placement of an anti-adhesion mesh with a special coating that is in contact with the bowel. However, there is a risk of intestinal adhesion or fistula, and it can be life-threatening (
