<p>In our case, the peritoneum separation time by laparoscopy was just 115 min, which was shorter than expected. With more patients and the accumulation of surgical experience, the operation time will decrease. The repair method of placing the mesh outside the peritoneum effectively avoids intestinal adhesion incidents and allows the use of ordinary mesh, thus reducing costs. At 48 h post-surgery, the patient was discharged with no post-operative complications such as pain, bleeding, or sepsis.</p>
