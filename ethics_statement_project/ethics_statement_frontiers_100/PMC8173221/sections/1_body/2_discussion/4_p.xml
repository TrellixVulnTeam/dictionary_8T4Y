<p>The mesh was placed after closing the defect at the end of the separation. We considered three ways to place the mesh, i.e., lap-TES-keyhole, lap-TES-sugarbaker, and lap-TES-sandwich (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In our patient, the sigmoid colon was short, causing it to adhere to the ventral wall with a certain tension. We therefore selected the keyhole-like method. The sugarbaker method is considered optimal; when a sugarbaker-like placement is used, the bowel at the stoma is treated in the same manner as the spermatic cord in inguinal hernia surgery. As in the case of the lap-TES-keyhole method, it is possible that TEP sugarbaker and sandwich surgical methods will be established in the future.
