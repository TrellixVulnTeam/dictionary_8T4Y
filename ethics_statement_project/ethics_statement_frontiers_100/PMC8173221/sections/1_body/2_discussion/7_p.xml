<p>Stoma necrosis, bowel obstruction, and/or perforation were observed during long-term follow-up in a study that used the retromuscular sugarbaker technique to repair a parastomal hernia (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The lack of data on long-term outcomes and technical difficulties are some shortcomings of the TEP endoscopy technique; additionally, the clinical efficacy, recurrence rate, and late complications must be confirmed in more cases with long-term follow-up.
