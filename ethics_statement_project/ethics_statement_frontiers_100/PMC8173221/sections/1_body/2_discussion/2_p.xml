<p>While operating, it is critical to move along the abdominal wall. On the abdominal wall, there are several easily separated spaces (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Area I lies between the rectus abdominis and posterior sheath of rectus abdominis. Area II includes the Bogros space, which extends between the transversalis fascia and parietal peritoneum and is a commonly used zone in urologic surgery. Area III comprises the Retzius space (located posterior to transversalis fascia and anterior to the urinary bladder) that is an extension for TEP operation in the lower abdomen. Area IV, between the linea alba and peritoneum, is easy to separate because it contains a large amount of adipose tissue. This area is divided into upper and lower parts by the umbilical region, which also needs to be separated. There is no connection between these spaces because of their different anatomic levels. In order to connect all of the abdominal spaces, three major partitions and the umbilical area must be penetrated (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The partitions are as follows: (A) between the lateral edge of the posterior sheath of the rectus abdominis and transverse abdominal muscle; (B) between the medial border of the posterior sheath of the rectus abdominis; and (C) between the transverse fascia of the abdomen extending downward and thickening at the outer edge of the arcuate line. This partitioning makes the separation of the extraperitoneal space very straightforward.
