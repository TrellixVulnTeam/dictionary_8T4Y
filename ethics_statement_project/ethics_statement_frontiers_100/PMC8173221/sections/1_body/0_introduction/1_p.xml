<p>Parastomal hernia, a frequent late complication following colostomy, involves protrusion of the abdominal viscera through a defect in the abdominal wall around the stoma; it has a high incidence rate (30–50%) (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Parastomal hernia of the sigmoid colon through the abdominal wall and perineum after radical resection of rectal carcinoma is common. The incidence of parastomal hernias is increasing with the prolongation of patient survival after this surgery; in severe cases, incarceration or intestinal obstruction may be life-threatening.
