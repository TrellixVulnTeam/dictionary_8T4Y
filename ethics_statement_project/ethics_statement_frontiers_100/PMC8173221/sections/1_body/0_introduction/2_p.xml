<p>Surgical repair is the treatment of choice for parastomal hernia (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Surgical approaches commonly employed in the past such as pure fascia repair and stoma relocation have been abandoned as they yielded poor results. Repair with a prosthetic mesh can significantly reduce the post-operative recurrence rate. However, there are many mesh-related complications such as intestinal fistula caused by mesh erosion and intestinal obstruction resulting from adhesion of the mesh to the intestine (

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). A laparoscopic approach (e.g., sugarbaker, keyhole, or sandwich procedures) combined with mesh repair has gained popularity in recent years for the treatment of parastomal hernia (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, this technique requires expensive anti-adhesion mesh with a specialized coating that still adheres to the intestines. Extraperitoneal mesh placement by laparoscopy can improve the surgical results and achieve a better clinical outcome while reducing the overall cost of treatment. The totally endoscopic sublay (TES) technique has been previously described (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and extraperitoneal/sublay parastomal hernia repair has been explored in open, laparoscopic, endoscopic, and robotic surgeries (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Here we present a case of a 74-year-old patient with parastomal hernia and a history of open radical resection treated with a totally extraperitoneal (TEP) endoscopic approach, with a good clinical outcome. We discuss the feasibility and possible operative approaches for endoscopic repair of parastomal hernia with the TEP technique.
