<p>An incision of 1.2 cm through the skin and subcutaneous adipose tissue was made at the right iliac region. The incised subcutaneous tissue was separated using a pair of retractors to expose and dissect aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle. Hemostatic forceps were used to separate the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles. The primary extraperitoneal space was created using a finger. To create the preperitoneal space, 2 sets of 5-mm trocars were inserted at the site of surgical incision using the retrograde puncture technique (
