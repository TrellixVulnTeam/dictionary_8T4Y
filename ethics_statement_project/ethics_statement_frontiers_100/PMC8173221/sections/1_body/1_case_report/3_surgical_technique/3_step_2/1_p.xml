<p>The further extraperitoneal space was created under direct endoscopic guidance down to the pubic floor and up to the bladder, where it was easier to create. We then moved to the contralateral side of the abdomen; as the long midline incision in the abdomen made it very difficult to separate the peritoneum, the membrane was cut while avoiding damage to the tissue at the middle of the incision, thus weakening the abdominal wall. When performing cephalad dissection, we targeted the space between the rectus abdominis and posterior sheath. To create the space, we opened the lateral edge of the posterior sheath to penetrate the extraperitoneal space between the lateral and mid-abdomen. The TEP technique was used for this separation. The dissecting plane of the lateral space was the extraperitoneal space between the peritoneum and parietal plane. During separation, the peritoneum was dissected and observed to avoid damage to the bowel around the stoma. Through the space that was created by separation, we enlarged the extraperitoneal space within a 15- to 20-cm radius around the stoma, providing a large field for mesh placement (
