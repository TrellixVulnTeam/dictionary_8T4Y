<p>Our analysis revealed that the women interviewed largely remained supportive of fracking due to its economic benefits while minimizing its potential links to their personal reproductive struggles. CDT Theory helps to explain our findings, as these themes indicate dissonance between cognitions about the economic benefits of fracking, potential harmful links between fracking and reproductive health, and a community identity rooted in part in the oil and gas industry. Overall, interviewees reduced dissonance by downplaying potential links between fracking and their personal reproductive health, thus enabling the cognitive maintenance of fracking as beneficial and unrelated to their health challenges.</p>
