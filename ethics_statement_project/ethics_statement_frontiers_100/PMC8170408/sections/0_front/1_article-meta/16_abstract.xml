 <p>Large‐volume central lymph node metastasis (large-volume CLNM) is associated with high recurrence rate in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients. However, sensitivity in investigating large-volume CLNM on preoperative ultrasonography (US) is not high. The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical factors associated with large-volume CLNM in clinical N0 PTC patients. We reviewed 976 PTC patients undergoing total thyroidectomy with central lymph node dissection during 2017 to 2019. The rate of large-volume LNM was 4.1% (40 of 967 patients). Multivariate analysis showed that male gender and young age (age&lt;45 years old) were independent risk factors for large-volume CLNM with odds ratios [(OR), 95% confidence interval (CI)] of 2.034 (1.015-4.073) and 2.997 (1.306–6.876), respectively. In papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC), capsule invasion was associated with large-volume CLNM with OR (95% CI) of 2.845 (1.110–7.288). In conventional papillary thyroid cancer (CPTC), tumor diameter (&gt;2cm) was associated with large-volume CLNM, with OR (95% CI) 3.757 (1.061–13.310), by multivariate analysis. In ROC curve analysis on the diameter of the CPTC tumor, the Area Under Curve (AUC) =0.682(p=0.013), the best cut-off point was selected as 2.0cm. In conclusion, male gender and young age were predictors for large-volume CLNM of cN0 PTC. cN0 PTMC patient with capsule invasion and cN0 CPTC patient with tumor diameter &gt;2cm were correlated with large-volume CLNM. Total thyroidectomy with central lymph node dissection may be a favorable primary treatment option for those patients.</p>
