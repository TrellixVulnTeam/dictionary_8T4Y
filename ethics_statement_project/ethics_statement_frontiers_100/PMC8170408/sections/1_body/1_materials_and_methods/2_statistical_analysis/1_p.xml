<p>Statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS statistics 26.0 software. The relationships between large-volume LNM and clinicopathologic characteristics were investigated by the X
 <sup>2</sup> test or one-way ANOVA to test univariate analyses. The multivariate analysis was performed on the variables that achieved P &lt;0.05 in the univariate analysis and predictive factors for large-volume LNM were tested by the logistic regression analysis and the data was presented as the mean Â± SD. P values&lt; 0.05 (two sided) were considered statistically significant.
