<p>In univariate analysis, young age (&lt;45 years), male, multifocality, nodule goiter and ETE were significantly associated with a high prevalence of large-volume CLNM (

 </xref>). However, bilateral tumors, marked hypoechoicity, irregular margin and non-well-defined shape were not correlated with the large-volume CLNM. In multivariate analysis, young age [odds ratio (OR): 2.034, 95% confidential interval (CI): 1.015-4.073, P =0.045] and male (OR: 2.997, 95% CI: 1.306â€“6.876, P= 0.010) were still significant predictive factors for large-volume CLNM (
