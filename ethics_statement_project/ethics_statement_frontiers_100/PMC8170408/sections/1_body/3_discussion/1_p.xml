<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that male sex, age, multifocality, tumor diameter&gt;0.5cm and ETE were independent risk factors for LNM in PTMC patients (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In this study, univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that age &lt;45 years and male gender are independent predictive factors for large-volume CLNM in cN0 PTC patients. In addition, capsule invasion is independent predictive factors for large-volume CLNM in cN0 PTMC, while tumor diameter &gt;2cm predicts large-volume CLNM in in cN0 CPTC.
