<p>Tumor size is considered as an important factor in TNM staging for PTC, and larger tumors tend to be more aggressive (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Recent studies reported that tumor diameter &gt;0.5 cm was independent risk factors for large-volume CLNM in cN0 PTMC (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, Shen et al. (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) demonstrated that the tumor diameter &gt;0.5 cm was not significantly different between the large-volume CLNM group and non- large-volume CLNM volume group. We were also unable to investigate the relationship between tumor diameter and large volume metastasis in cN0 PTMC. However, in CPTC, we found that tumor diameter higher than 2cm is associated with large-volume CLNM. Ito et al. (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and Ma et al. (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) reported that tumor diameter of &gt;2cm is the strongest predictor of CLNM and lymph node recurrence in PTC. Compared with tumor diameter &lt;2cm, tumor diameter &gt;2cm was correlated with the five times higher risk of recurrence in PTC patients aged ≥55 years old (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). ROC curve analysis was used to determine the cutoff point of tumor size for predicting large-volume metastasis and found that tumor diameter higher than 2cm was the strongest predictor of large-volume CLNM in cN0 CPTC. Therefore, tumor diameter higher than 2cm should be evaluated carefully for possible large-volume CLNM of PTC. In addition, careful prophylactic central node dissection should be recommended for N0 CPTC with a large tumor diameter (tumor diameter &gt;2cm).
