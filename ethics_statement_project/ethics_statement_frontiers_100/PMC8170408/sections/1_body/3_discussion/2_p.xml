<p>Age is regarded as the most important prognostic factors for thyroid cancer. 45 years is widely adopted as clinically important prognostic marker in PTC patients. Our study demonstrates that the rate of large-volume CLNM was higher in patients &lt; 45 years than that â‰¥45 years (13.6% 
 <italic>vs.</italic> 6.9%, P = 0.046). Multivariate analysis shows age &lt; 45 years was independent predictor of large-volume CLNM inpatients with cN0 PTC. Similarly, previous studies have reported that CLNM was more likely to appear in PTC patients with age &lt; 45 years, which may be due to rapid tumor diameter growth in young patient during surveillance period (
