<p>Male gender has been identified as a risk factor for thyroid carcinoma (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Similarly, recent studies have revealed that men exhibited aggressive behavior and poorer prognosis than women among PTC patients (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Among PTC patients who did not undergo prophylactic central neck dissection, male gender is a risk factor for further recurrence (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). This study also showed male gender as the predictive factor for large-volume CLNM in cN0 PTC. Therefore, male patient with cN0 PTC should be evaluated carefully and complete central neck dissection may be favorable.
