<p>With the increased diagnosis of PTC, a growing number of patients with PTMC have been detected. PTMC appears to account for the majority of the increased incidence of thyroid cancer (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Capsule invasion is considered as aggressive behavior of PTMC, which is correlated with CLNM, even with lymph nodes posterior to right recurrent laryngeal nerve metastasis (LN-prRLN) (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In PTMC, previous studies did not demonstrate the clear relationship between capsule invasion and large- volume metastasis. A novel finding in our study is that capsule invasion is more likely to present with large-volume metastasis. (P=0.029, OR =2.845, with 95% CI: ranged from 1.110-7.288). The incidence of large-volume CLNM in capsule invasion and non-capsule invasion were 23% 
 <italic>vs.</italic> 5.6%, with a P value &lt;0.05 in multivariate analysis. It might be expected that the PTMC with capsule invasion more likely showed extrathyroidal metastasis potential to lymph node and distant organs, which significantly accounted for the high incidence of large-volume CLNM and high recurrence rate.
