<p>In the previous study, young age and male sex have been highlighted with large-volume CLNM in PTMC patient, suggesting surgery may be the primary option for young male patients (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). PTMC with multifocality, tumor diameter&gt;0.5cm and extrathyroidal extension (ETE) also tends to have large-volume CLNM (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, the clinicopathologic factors associated with large-volume CLNM in CPTC are not well-established (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Sensitivity of ultrasound examination for central neck lymph node metastasis was not high (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Therefore, identifying risk factors for large-volume CLNM in clinical N0 PTC patients might be helpful in deciding on a management strategy in PTC patients.
