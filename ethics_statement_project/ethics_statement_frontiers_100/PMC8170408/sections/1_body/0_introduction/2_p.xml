<p>PTC has a high metastasis rate especially central lymph node metastasis (CLNM), approximately 30%-80% of PTC patients have CLNM (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). It has been reported that 30% to 65% of patients with cN0 PTC are detected CLNM (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The recurrence rate of patients with CLNM mainly depends on the number of involved lymph node and the size of the largest lymph node (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Patients with large-volume lymph node metastasis (&gt;5 involved lymph nodes) can significantly increase the risk of recurrence during long-time survival, associated with 20% recurrence rates, while small-volume metastasis (â‰¤5 involved lymph nodes) accounts for 5% recurrence rates (
