<p>In conclusion, age&lt;45 years and male gender are independent predictors of large-volume CLNM metastasis in patients with cN0 PTC. Total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection may be a favorable option for surgeons when treating young male patients with cN0 PTC. Besides, cN0 PTMC patient with capsule invasion and cN0 CPTC patient with tumor diameter &gt;2cm have higher prevalence of large-volume CLNM. Therefore, these factors should be considered by the surgeons when evaluating the risk of large-volume CLNM of PTC. Follow-up visits for post-operative patients with these pathologic characteristics should be regarded.</p>
