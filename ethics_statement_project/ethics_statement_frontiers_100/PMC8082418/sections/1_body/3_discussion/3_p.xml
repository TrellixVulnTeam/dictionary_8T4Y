<p>All patients adhered to the home care support program and continued treatment without interruption and side effects. The quality of life measured with a short questionnaire showed a positive change after three months of home therapy. The patients reported being less stressed undergoing treatment at home, burdening less on their family and friends, and feeling less interference with their personal and family life. It should also be considered that some patients lose days of work or study to carry out the therapy at the hospital, while at home it can be carried out before or after work/study.</p>
