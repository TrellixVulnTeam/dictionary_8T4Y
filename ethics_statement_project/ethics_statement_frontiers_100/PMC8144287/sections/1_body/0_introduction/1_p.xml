<p>The SARS-CoV-2 [Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID19)] pandemic has posed new challenges to the global cardiovascular community. The goals of any tertiary cardiac center are 2-fold: limit transmission of the infection to the public and healthcare personnel while providing timely and safe care to patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Conventionally, the role of cardiovascular computed tomography (CCT) in ACS has been minimal as the majority of these patients commonly undergo an early invasive strategy. COVID19 created a new reality in many healthcare systems where an invasive strategy is limited by the availability of healthcare workers, personal protective equipment (PPE) and beds. In this study we review the evolving role of CCT in ACS in a tertiary cardiac center in Saudi Arabia during the COVID19 pandemic.</p>
