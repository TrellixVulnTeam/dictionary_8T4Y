<p>COVID19 presented a unique opportunity for CCT to assist in providing anatomic risk stratification for those with ACS allowing expedited discharge of those with low risk anatomy and preserving beds during the outbreak. It also reduced invasive procedures and exposure of catheterization laboratory personnel with conservation of PPE in lower risk patients. Nevertheless, individualized case by case decisions are still necessary to ensure patient outcomes for the higher risk categories. This snapshot warrants exploring the role of CCT in ACS further through larger randomized studies. It is in keeping with the latest ESC NSTEACS guidelines.</p>
