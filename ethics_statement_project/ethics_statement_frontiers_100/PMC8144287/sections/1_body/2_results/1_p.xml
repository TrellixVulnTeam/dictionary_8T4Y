<p>This cohort comprises the first 27 patients evaluated in the emergency room immediately after the COVID19 lockdown in Jeddah, March 15, 2020 who presented with acute onset chest pain consistent with angina of which 13 had a positive high sensitivity troponin I assay. The results are summarized in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The mean age was 52 years (range 20–73 years). Fifty-two percent were women. Six patients had no known atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk factors and seven had 3 or more risk factors. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 50% (range 15–65%). All CCT images were interpretable with no limitations or significant artifact. CCT identified critical disease in 7 patients (26%) all of whom had presented with a NSTEMI, normal epicardial coronary arteries in 11 (41%) and mild to moderate disease in 9 (33%). All patients with normal or mild to moderate disease were assigned to a conservative strategy and discharged within 24 h. Those with a NSTEMI and critical anatomy were assigned to an additional invasive evaluation of which four underwent ad

Examples of obstructive disease detected by CCT and treated by PCI are illustrated in
