<p>Patients' COVID19 status and the results of the CCT were then used to determine the treatment strategy as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Patients who had a negative COVID19 PCR and a normal CCT were discharged home immediately. Those with critical anatomy were admitted for an invasive coronary angiogram. Critical anatomy was defined as stenosis &gt;70% in major epicardial coronary vessels or Left main stenosis. Those with mild or moderate distal or branch vessel disease were discussed with the main responsible physician and patient to consider medical therapy and early discharge. As for those who were COVID19 positive or under investigation, normal or mild to moderate coronary disease on CCT allowed discharge of the patients to an isolation facility. Critical anatomy required hospitalization in an isolation unit. A case by case discussion ensued in a heart team format to determine the most appropriate course of action (conservative, surgical or percutaneous revascularization).
