<p>All elective admissions to the cardiac center were canceled. Only patients requiring acute cardiac care were transferred from outlying hospitals provided the COVID19 screen was negative. Patients presenting to KFAFH's emergency room with an ACS were screened for COVID19 symptoms in particular fever, cough and shortness of breath. If there was no suspicion of COVID19, the usual guideline directed ACS protocols were adopted. However, those with a suspicion based on symptoms or referral source were placed in isolation and a screening test was requested. The COVID19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was sent to an on-site laboratory and results were obtained in 3â€“4 h. The ACS CCT protocol adopted is defined in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Those with chest pain or an ACS were risk stratified according to the GRACE Score and hemodynamics. If patients were unstable, had an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or had prohibitive renal dysfunction, they were excluded and did not undergo a CCT. Stable patients with chest pain or an ACS underwent CCT. The precautions employed for those with a COVID19 negative screen were standard universal precautions. Those under investigation or positive for COVID19 underwent CTA in a dedicated Seimens 128 Flash CT Scanner with special precautions. During the CCT study, staffing in the room was minimized to the nurse who placed the electrodes, connected the intravenous cannula and positioned the patient. The nurse wore PPE as recommended by the WHO including an N95 mask. The imaging expert and radiographer remained in the control room. The patient was transported with a regular surgical mask directly to the one designated CT scanner bypassing the holding and recovery areas.
