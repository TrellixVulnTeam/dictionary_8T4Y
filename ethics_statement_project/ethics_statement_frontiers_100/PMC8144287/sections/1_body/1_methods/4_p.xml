<p>The CCT study was performed using standard imaging protocols for coronary evaluation and included the lung fields. Two-dimensional maximum intensity projections and multiplanar reformatted images as well as three-dimensional images were evaluated on a Syngo Via workstation by an imaging expert. Coronary artery calcium score, coronary stenosis and the lung parenchyma were all assessed and reported. Quadruple rule outs for pulmonary embolism, myocardial perfusion, coronary anatomy and parenchymal lung involvement were employed whenever possible.</p>
