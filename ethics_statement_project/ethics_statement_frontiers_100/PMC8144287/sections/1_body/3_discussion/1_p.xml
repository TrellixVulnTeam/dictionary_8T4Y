<p>CCT has an established role in the assessment of patients with stable coronary syndromes which has been validated in multiple randomized clinical trials (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). It's role in the evaluation of patients in the emergency room has also been studied in several randomized trials the most notable being the ROMICAT I and II trials (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, the patients in these trials were low to intermediate risk with negative initial cardiac serum markers and electrocardiograms. In the ROMICAT cohorts, both the feasibility and safety of such a strategy were confirmed. The average length of stay was significantly reduced with no increase in major adverse cardiac events at 28 days.
