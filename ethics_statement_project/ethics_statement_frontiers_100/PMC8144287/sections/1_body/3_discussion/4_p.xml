<p>There is ample evidence that the negative predictive value (NPV) of CCT exceeds 90% sensitivity and specificity of 96.5 and 72.4% respectively. It is noteworthy that the NPV is not impacted by the clinical risk scores (

The utility in low risk ACS has been added to the European Society of Cardiology's Non-ST elevation Myocardial Infarction Guidelines (ESC NSTEACS) elaborated in August 2020 suggesting a wider role for this technology in select patients. Our experience during the COVID19 adds to the growing experience with streamlining care using CCT in low risk ACS (

Intracoronary imaging and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging have been recommended in the evaluation of those with myocardial infarction and non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA). Establishing protocols that permit expeditious inpatient or outpatient assessment of such cases is important.
