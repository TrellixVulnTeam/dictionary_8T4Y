<p>During the current COVID19 pandemic, utilization of healthcare resources including beds and PPE in addition to exposure of HCW to COVID19 is a priority (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). This must be balanced against a timely designation of the treatment strategy for ACS patients. We, therefore, included those with positive serum markers who had either confirmed or suspected COVID19 infection. The results of this snapshot study indicated that 80% of patients were discharged within 24 h, the majority directly from the emergency room signifying very efficient bed utilization. Fifty perchantage of those were discharged the same day and carried a low Grace Score. The overall low Grace Score of the study population, including those who presented with a NSTEMI, suggests such a strategy of non-invasive assessment of the coronary arteries and rapid discharge planning may be applicable only to a low or intermediate risk populations. This is in line with the previously mentioned ROMICAT studies enrolling similar populations and excluded high risk, STEMI and patients in shock. There was a marked reduction in invasive angiography and subsequently less consumption of PPE and exposure of catheterization personnel. None of the staff in the CCT department or catheterization laboratory were infected.
