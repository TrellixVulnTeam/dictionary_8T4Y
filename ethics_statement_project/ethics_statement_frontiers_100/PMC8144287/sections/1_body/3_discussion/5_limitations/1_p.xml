<p>This is a snapshot study with a small number of patients. The study only serves as a pilot that requires further validation through large scale randomized trials. There is no long term follow up available. However, during such an outbreak the goal of all centers is to provide acute care for a surge of COVID19 patients that can overwhelm the system. Furthermore, it should be noted that the ROMICAT trials reported outcome data at 28 days only. The purpose of pathways that include CCT is to enable cardiac centers to further risk stratify patients and allow early discharge. CT scanners are often shared by the cardiology and radiology services. Therefore, adoption of these pathways would require coordination between the departments. In addition, during such an outbreak it is necessary to prioritize studies for all patients with both cardiac and non-cardiac needs.</p>
