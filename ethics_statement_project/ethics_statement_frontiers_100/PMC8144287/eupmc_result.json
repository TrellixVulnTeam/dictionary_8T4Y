Several trials evaluated CCT in low and intermediate risk patients presenting to the emergency room (ER) and noted that it was both safe and feasible. During the COVID19 pandemic, it is imperative to adopt a pathway for the evaluation of ACS that permits early discharge, reduces invasive coronary angiography and limits exposure of healthcare workers.
