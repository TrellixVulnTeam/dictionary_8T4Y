It is surprising yet unfortunate that the number of teenage suicide deaths and teenage infections of gonorrhea have increased over the years, becoming serious public health concerns in Taiwan. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of an education course on teenagers' understanding of adolescence and their attitudes toward life, sex, gender equality, and mental health. <b>Material and Methods:</b> Participants were comprised of Taiwanese students in Grades 5 to 9 who completed a Life-Sex-Emotions course, titled \"Sailing through Adolescence.\" The effect of the course was measured using pre- and post-test scores on the Perception Index of Life-Sex-Emotions Education (PILSEE) instrument.
