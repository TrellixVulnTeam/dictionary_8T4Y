<p>The 20-item PILSEE instrument was developed to assess students' attitudes about aspects of adolescent life. The PILSEE was designed by the same three experts that developed the education course and is comprised of seven subscales: value of Life (three items), Secrets of Adolescence (three items), Gender Roles (three items), Friendship and Love (three items), Myths of the Media (two items), Adolescent Sexuality (three items), and Views of Marriage and Sex (three items). Each item is scored on a Likert scale from 1 to 5; item scores range from 1 to 5. Subscale scores are the sum of the item scores; the total score ranges from 20 to 100. Higher scores indicate a more positive attitude toward adolescence. Data collected from students in 2014 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8,693) examined validity and reliability of the scale. The face validity was 4.86â€“4.98; the CVI for content validity was good (81.67%). The Cronbach's alpha assessing for internal consistence for each of the seven subscales was from 0.733 to 0.898; the Cronbach's alpha for overall was 0.956. For confirmatory factor analysis, the factor loadings for 18 out of 20 questions were over 0.7, and the remaining two questions were 0.692 and 0.591. GFI was 0.953, AGFI was 0.933, and both NFI and NNFI were over 0.9. Overall, this questionnaire had good reliability and validity and could serve as an evaluation tool.
