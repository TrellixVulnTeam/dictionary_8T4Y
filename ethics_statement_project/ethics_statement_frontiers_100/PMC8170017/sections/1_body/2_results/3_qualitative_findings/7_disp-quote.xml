  <italic>The boy liked to play house so his classmates bullied and laughed at him in the film. He was very unhappy and sad. However, his teacher found that he was a responsible boy and would help his mother. We should not have gender stereotypes of traits or hobbies. For example, my dad is a sushi chef and a cook. We should respect the hobbies and traits of others</italic>.
