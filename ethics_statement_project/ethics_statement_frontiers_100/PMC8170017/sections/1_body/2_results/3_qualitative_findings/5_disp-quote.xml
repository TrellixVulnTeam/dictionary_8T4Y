  <italic>I think this course has helped me understand myself better as well as the changes during adolescence, and how to prepare for them. It also helped me to know that those changes are normal and there's nothing wrong with me. We should be thankful that we are healthy. We must cherish and accept ourselves, and we need to be more confident and accept challenges in adolescence and in life</italic>.
