  <italic>I think confession should be from one's heart and should be sincere. We should not judge others by their looks, but instead, we shall focus on the beauty of peoples' personalities. We should not make friends with people only for their good looks, as some good-looking people could be rude. There are many kinds of people on the Internet. Don't talk to anyone you are not familiar with on the internet, because you don't know him/her quite well</italic>.
