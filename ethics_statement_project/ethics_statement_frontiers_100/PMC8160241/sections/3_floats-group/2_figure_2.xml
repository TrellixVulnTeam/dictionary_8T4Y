  <p>Brain MRI findings from the third and fourth scans. Third MRI scan (on day 22): axial FLAIR showed reduced meningo-cortical lesions that were still clearly observable (
   <bold>Kâ€“O</bold>, arrows). Fourth MRI scan (on day 37): axial FLAIR showed that the meningo-cortical lesions were further resolved (
   <bold>P</bold> and 
   <bold>Q</bold>, arrows), but new lesions were present in the right parietal cortex and right cerebellar dentate nucleus (
   <bold>R</bold> and 
   <bold>S</bold>, arrows). T1-weighted postgadolinium-enhanced image showing left optic nerve thickening and obvious enhancement (
   <bold>T</bold>, arrow).
