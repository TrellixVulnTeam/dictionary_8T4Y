  <p>Brain MRI findings from the first and second scans. First MRI scan (on day 2): axial FLAIR hyperintensity was seen in the sulci of the bilateral frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes (
   <bold>A–D</bold>, arrows). Corresponding meningo-cortical enhancement was also seen on axial T1-weighted postgadolinium-enhanced images (
   <bold>E</bold>, arrow). Second MRI scan (on day 7): meningo-cortical lesions on axial FLAIR were mildly regressed, but abnormalities were still observed (
   <bold>F–I</bold>, arrows). T1-weighted postgadolinium-enhanced image showed a corresponding meningo-cortical lesion with no enhancement
