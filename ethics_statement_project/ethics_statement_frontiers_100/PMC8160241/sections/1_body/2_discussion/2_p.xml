<p>Here we described a case of MOGAD presenting with the MRI feature of bilateral meningo-cortical involvement. The exact correlations between meningeal and cortical involvement are not fully clear, but there are two possible mechanisms. One suggests that primarily meningeal lesions spread to the cortex, while the other proposed that both meningeal and cortical lesions appear simultaneously (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Unlike the other common phenotype of MOGAD, cases involving cortical lesions do not exhibit distinct pathologic demyelination features and have only mild inflammatory changes (

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). One perspective is that MOGAD with cortical lesions should be considered as a new disease associated with anti-MOG antibodies (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Other recent studies have indicated that anti-MOG antibodies may not be directly associated with the cortical lesion phenotype or may not even be involved in this phenotype (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Although no evidence of other auto-antibodies has been detected in FLAMES-related phenotypes so far, an unknown auto-antibody might be involved in disease pathogenesis (
