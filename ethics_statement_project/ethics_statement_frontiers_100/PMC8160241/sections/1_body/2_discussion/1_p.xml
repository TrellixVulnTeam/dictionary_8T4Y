<p>In 2017, Ogawa et al. (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) first reported a rare MOGAD phenotype with unique unilateral cortical encephalitis properties. Budhram et al. (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) more thoroughly characterized these unique clinico-radiographic syndrome and referred to this entity as FLAMES. Although initially described as a unilateral cortical encephalitis, it can also manifest as bilateral cortical lesions with or without leptomeningeal involvement (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) or even isolated unilateral leptomeningeal enhancement (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). FLAMES is more likely to be misdiagnosed as other CNS diseases such as viral meningitis, carcinomatous meningitis, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. In our case, the patient initially presented with fever, headache, and cerebrospinal fluid findings similar to those associated of viral meningitis. We were unaware of the possibility of bilateral meningo-cortical MOGAD manifestations, which delayed the diagnosis. Given that the FLAMES phenotype is highly steroid-responsive, increased knowledge and appreciation of these symptoms is critical to facilitate timely treatment.
