<p>Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-immunoglobulin G (IgG) associated disorder (MOGAD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings often involve the white matter, thalamus, pons, optic nerve, and spinal cord (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Notably, the phenotype of unilateral fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)-hyperintense lesions in anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-associated encephalitis with seizures (FLAMES) has distinct radiographic manifestations (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) that are different from other common phenotypes. To date, only a few cases of FLAMES have been reported in the literature, and there are limited longitudinal MRI data regarding this entity. This case report covers the complete trajectory of MOGAD findings from initial meningo-cortical involvement to consequent MRI changes.
