<p>On June 16, 2020, a 39-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital following 2 days of seizures that were preceded by 15 days of fever and headache. The patient denied having any prior psychiatric or other diseases. His neck was slightly stiff, and there were suspiciously positive bilateral Kernig's signs. On day 2 of hospitalization, the initial MRI examination showed FLAIR hyperintensities in the cortex and meninges of the bilateral frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes; the abnormalities were also clearly visualized on T1-weighted post-gadolinium-enhanced images (

The patient was considered to have developed a central nervous system (CNS) infection and was given empiric antibiotic and antiviral therapy, but his condition steadily worsened, suggesting that there may be other underlying etiologies (e.g., autoimmune encephalitis or tuberculous meningoencephalitis). After considering the pros and cons, we administered high-dose immunoglobulin treatment, and the patient's symptoms rapidly improved. The second MRI examination on day 8 demonstrated mildly regressed meningo-cortical lesions, but abnormalities were still observed (

 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) supported the existence of autoimmune encephalitis or a CNS infection. We did not prescribe corticosteroid therapy due to concern about unknown infections. After further observation, the third MRI examination conducted on day 24 showed that the meningo-cortical lesions had decreased but were still clearly observable (
