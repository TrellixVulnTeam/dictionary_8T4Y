<p>On August 9, 2020, he was followed-up at our outpatient clinic and reported that the vision in his left eye was severely impaired. This symptom first manifested ~1 month earlier, but it was mild and he did not seek medical help. A fourth MRI examination was immediately conducted and showed that the meningo-cortical lesions were reduced compared, but new lesions were present in the right parietal lobe, right cerebellar dentate nucleus, and left optic nerve (

The patient refused hospital re-admission, further examinations, or further high-dose immunoglobulin therapy due to economic reasons, so we prescribed low-dose corticosteroid therapy. The patient's visual acuity was considerably improved after treatment, which he decided to discontinue after ~1 month. On December 19, 2020, the patient complained that his left visual acuity had again deteriorated, and he was re-admitted to the hospital. A fifth MRI examination showed that the original lesions were diminished, but new lesions had developed around the deep white matter (

The patient accepted high-dose corticosteroid treatment, and his left visual acuity gradually improved. The sixth and final MRI examination was conducted on January 8, 2021 and showed substantial reductions in the original lesions without new lesion formation (
