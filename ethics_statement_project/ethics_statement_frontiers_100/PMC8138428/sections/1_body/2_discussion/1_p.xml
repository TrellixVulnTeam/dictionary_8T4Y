Due to the delay in time, the diagnosis is sometimes difficult, especially for patients with a history of lumbar disc herniation and imaging with nerve compression in the corresponding segment. So it is necessary for us to pay attention to the possibility of sciatic HZ about 2 weeks from the onset of lower limb pain.
