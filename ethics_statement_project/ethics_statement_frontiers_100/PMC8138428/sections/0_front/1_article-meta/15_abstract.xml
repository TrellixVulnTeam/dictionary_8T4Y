  <bold>Background:</bold> The symptoms of sciatic herpes zoster are sometimes difficult to distinguish from sciatica caused by lumbar disc herniation. We describe a case of suspected lumbar disc herniation with sciatic herpes zoster to reduce the rate of misdiagnosis.

  <bold>Case Report:</bold> A 55-year old man, male, developed low back pain after carrying heavy items 20 years ago. Characteristics of symptoms: 1. Symptoms were aggravated in the upright lumbar forward flexion position; 2. The VAS (leg) score was 8â€“9 points and the VSA (lumbar) score was 0 point; 3. It can be relieved when rested in the supine position; 4. It came on intermittently with radiation pain in the right lower limb. There were several attacks every year. One month ago, there was radiating pain in the right lower limb. The pain was from the back of the right hip, behind the thigh, in lateral crural region, to the back of the foot. And Symptoms worsened for 10 days. The VAS score was 8 points. Pain could not be relieved by rest or changing posture.
