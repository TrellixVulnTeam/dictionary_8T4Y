<p>Etiological detection is the most important basis for the PTB diagnosis (

So far, there has been little discussion to improve the diagnosis of clinically diagnosed PTB and less attempted to incorporate new molecular predictors, which always have an insufficient sample size (TB sample size range: 22–114) and without an independent validation cohort (
