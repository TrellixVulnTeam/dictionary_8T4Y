<p>To some extent, our prediction model avoids these deficiencies and has the advantages of prospective, relatively sufficient sample size, satisfactory performance and independent validation cohort validation. In this study, we establish a new approach to assist the identification of PTB patients via three main steps. First, the candidate biomarker, lncRNA n344917, is confirmed to be down-regulated in clinically diagnosed PTB. Second, a novel rapid universal and comprehensive prediction model combining the molecular biomarker, EHR and laboratory variables, is constructed. This will make up for the deficiency of the detection method and enhance the identification of clinically diagnosed PTB from more aspects. Third, the prediction model is encapsulated as a user-friendly web-based application and externally validated.</p>
