<p>Verification results show that the performance of our model still has a compelling predictive effect in the independent validation cohort, including PTB patients with an aetiological evidence, clinically diagnosed PTB and non-TB DC, which indicates the reliability, robustness and broad universality of our model. Relatively high AUC and calibration curve with a good fitting effect indicate that the model has good discrimination and consistency. The DCA curve demonstrates that the prediction of our model has relatively high net benefits when the threshold probability falls between 20 and 80%. DCA was first invented by Vickers and co-workers in 2006 and has been widely used to assess the net benefits of diagnostic testing, as well as the impact of under- and over-treatment (

Given that DCA is more concerned with the consequences of predictive information and may complement the deficiency of previous evaluation that only focuses on accuracy, it has been recommended by top clinical journals and used in various clinical fields (

In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of our prediction model are 88.89 and 86.43%, while the positive predictive value is 85.61% and negative predictive value is 89.63%. Hence, through the earlier anti-tuberculosis treatment, given according to the diagnostic results of our proposed model, it is hoped that the disease damage and infection rate can be effectively reduced, thereby ultimately ending PTB transmission globally.
