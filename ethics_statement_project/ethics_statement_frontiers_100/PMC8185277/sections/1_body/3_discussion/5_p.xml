<p>Several studies have documented that diagnostic applications have great potential in providing diagnostic definitions. Therefore, the model is encapsulated as an open-source and free predictive web-based application for the actual clinical application. It is free, user-friendly and relatively simple, such that it does not need any programming foundation to be operated. Both clinicians and patients can directly obtain the probability of PTB by entering the necessary information as input, providing effective support for automated medical diagnosis, especially in low- and middle-income countries with constrained resources and high prevalence of PTB. It can also help doctors to compare the results with other information in order to reach a comprehensive conclusion, which represents an enhancement for assessing difficult-to-diagnose PTB to medical diagnosis. With the popularization of digital medical and mobile terminals, we believe that our research can provide better diagnostic services now and in the future.</p>
