<p>The experimental scheme referred to the preceding exploration of our research group (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bai et al., 2019</xref>). Peripheral blood samples were collected from the participants and isolated to obtain PBMC. Total RNA was extracted according to the Trizol reagent specifications, and its concentration and quality were measured using a spectrophotometer. Then, the RNA was reverse transcribed into complementary DNA using the Takara Prime Script
 <sup>TM</sup>RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara, Japan). The expression level of n344917 was detected using qRT-PCR according to the SYBR method. The reaction system was as follows: 5 μL of Mix (2 × KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Master Mix2 Universal), 0.2 μL of specific forward primers, 0.2 μL of specific reverse primers, and 1 μL of reverse transcripts.
