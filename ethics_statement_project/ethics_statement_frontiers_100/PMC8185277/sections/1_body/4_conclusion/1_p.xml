<p>In conclusion, this study reveals lncRNA n344917 as a potential molecular biomarker for the clinically diagnosed PTB. We constructed and validated a prediction model combining n344917, laboratory and EHR variables to enhance the identification of PTB and encapsulated it as an open-source and free predictive web-based application for the actual clinical application. In the future, we plan to optimize and validate our model among different ethnic groups. Achieving better understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying the association between n344917 and disease development and progression will be needed to improve the early diagnosis of PTB.</p>
