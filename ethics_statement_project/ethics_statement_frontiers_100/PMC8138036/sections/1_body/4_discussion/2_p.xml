<p>Nursing practice is guided by a professional code of ethics, which is applicable wherever and whenever nurses are working. The code allows nurses to identify ethical issues and provides guidance on how to take ethical decisions and actions when providing care. In certain circumstances, nurses are allowed to choose not to provide patient care. The safety of nurses and other frontline healthcare workers is a pressing ethical concern, as they are often asked to work under conditions that pose substantial and inadequately understood risks to their overall health and well-being. In addition, nurses may choose not to provide patient care if they lack the support they need to meet their personal and family needs or if they are also worried about the moral, professional, and legal protection when providing nursing care.</p>
