<p>The nurses in the current study reported that it was their duty to care for patients regardless of their medical condition or diagnoses. They expressed that this was part of their professional ethics, which are framed by standards of human rights. Since the nurses were aware that their profession is directed toward the care of patients and the community, they believed that they had a national/community commitment to not refuse to provide care for any patient. In addition, the most common ethical issues among the majority of the nurses in the current study were related to the protection of patients' rights, since this is one of the founding principles of nursing practice. The value of beneficence, professional advocacy, and serving the best interests of patients is emphasized by both national and international nursing standards of ethical behavior.</p>
