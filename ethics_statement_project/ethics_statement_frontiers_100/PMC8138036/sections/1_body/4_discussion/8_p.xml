<p>The nurses in the current study had volunteered to work with patients with COVID-19, as they believed that it is part of nurses' responsibility to take care of patients regardless of their diagnoses. Nonetheless, the participating nurses expressed that working with COVID-19 patients should not be obligatory, as some nurses may be incapable of providing the required care in unexpected and unclear circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, some nurses may be sick or may have social obligations such as caring for children or elderly family members. The participating nurses felt that it is the obligation of employers to foster work environments wherein the health and well-being of healthcare professionals are ensured. This may include the provision of immunizations and adequate personal protective equipment, in addition to other operational protocols. Moreover, it is impossible to follow the ethical requirements of clinical practice without adequate staffing. Understaffing and other systematic challenges could impede nurses from performing many of their primary duties, such as maintaining the needs of particular patients and families, alleviating pain, and maintaining their own honesty.</p>
