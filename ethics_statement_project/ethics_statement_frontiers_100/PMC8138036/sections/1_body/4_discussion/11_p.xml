<p>The study has a few limitations. A small sample size (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10) may not represent all nurses working with COVID-19 patients, but this number is sufficient for no new themes to emerge. Also, there was repetition in the information provided and reached saturation. Another limitation of this qualitative study's findings is not intended to be generalized but rather to be used to gain an understanding of the experiences of nurses working with COVID-19 patients.
