<p>Study participants filled out a questionnaire that was specifically developed for this study (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Appendix 1</xref>), received an intervention directly afterwards in the form of a written text informing them about vaccination (in particular, the concept of herd immunity), and were asked some questions related to this text. A neutrally formulated text (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Appendix 2a</xref>) published by the Federal Centre for Health Education (BZgA), which is a specialist authority within the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Health in Germany aiming to promote health education (e.g., in terms of guidelines, training, and coordination) at the national level, was compared to a text written by Dr. Eckart von Hirschhausen, a famous cabaret artist and comedian, which used humorous elements in the form of a fairytale (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Appendix 2b</xref>). The texts are both written in the German language, include the same arguments, and are comparable in length (439 vs. 426 words). The authors of the texts are not mentioned. One of the two texts was randomly allocated to each study participant. For the paper-and-pencil questionnaire, the randomization took place at the level of kindergartens (with the parents of children within one kindergarten all receiving the same intervention), and for the online questionnaire at the individual level (with random allocation). No compensation was provided for participation.
