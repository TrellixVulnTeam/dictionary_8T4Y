<p>An experimental study was conducted among parents having at least one child of kindergarten age (up to 6 years old). Recruitment took place in kindergartens in Bielefeld (a city with about 330,000 inhabitants in Germany) and using social media (Facebook). The sample was primarily collected in kindergartens in Bielefeld, because it can be assumed that within the different kindergartens—according to the residential area and the funding body—the heterogeneity in terms of sociodemographic characteristics of all parents is represented. Therefore, we expected to reach an almost representative sample representing the majority of parents of small children in Bielefeld. Paper-and-pencil questionnaires were used in the kindergarten setting, while the same questionnaire was used in an online format for the participants recruited via social media.</p>
