<p>Although some studies have already explored the advantages of narrative texts, they are obviously not suitable for conveying every subject. Narratives do not usually contain explicitly formulated arguments for or against a fact and are therefore less instructive (

However, it should be borne in mind that people who read a text on vaccination for information purposes want to see arguments and facts to facilitate their decision for or against vaccination. This is particularly important in relation to the autonomy of parents. Since parents want to decide autonomously about the welfare of their children, patronizing information can lead to a rejection of the issue. There is a risk that a narrative story will distract from the relevant information if the plot and the information to be conveyed are not sufficiently closely linked (
