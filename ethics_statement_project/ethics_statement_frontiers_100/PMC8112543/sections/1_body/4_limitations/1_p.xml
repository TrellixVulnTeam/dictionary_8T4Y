<p>This study faces several methodological limitations. First of all, the results are based on a small sample size. The sample lacked a denominator, so we were not able to calculate a response rate. It needs to be emphasized that all the information gathered is based on the self-reported judgement of the study participants themselves. The results should be interpreted with caution due to ceiling effects: the understandability of both texts was very high. Therefore, one cannot investigate the impact of different text styles on comprehensibility, which might affect knowledge and/or behavior. Future research in this area might assess the functional health literacy related to this topic. The ceiling effects might, therefore, have led to an underestimation of effects, particularly because—according to the self-reported appraisal—the humorous text was not judged to be equally as credible as the neutral text.</p>
