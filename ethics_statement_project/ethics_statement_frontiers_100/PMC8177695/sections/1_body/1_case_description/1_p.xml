<p>A 54-year-old nulligravida female had a 10-year history of nocturia, urinary frequency and recurrent urinary tract infections which had been managed with short courses of antibiotics. On presentation, physical examination revealed a firm hard mass along the anterior vaginal wall. Her examination was otherwise unremarkable and specifically no evidence of bony dysplasia of her limbs. Despite the length of symptoms, she had not undergone any investigations for her long-standing urinary symptoms until a computed tomography (CT) scan of her pelvis was organized and a large pelvic mass emerging from her pubis was noted, prompting specialist sarcoma service referral. The patient consented to the production of this report and it was approved by our ethics committee.</p>
