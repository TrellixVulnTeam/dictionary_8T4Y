<p>Functional imaging including both thallium-201 and technetium-99 pentavalaent dimercaptsouccinic acid (DMSA V) scintigraphy were utilized and demonstrated minimal metabolic activity within the tumor. A CT scan of the chest was performed which excluded pulmonary metastatic disease. Following these investigations, a CT-guided tissue biopsy targeting an area of increased metabolic activity demonstrated a cartilaginous lesion with mild atypia and some focal calcification. This case was discussed at a multidisciplinary meeting involving sarcoma specialist surgeons, radiologists and pathologists. Given the size and histological nature of the lesion, the decision was made to manage this lesion as an atypical cartilaginous tumor.</p>
