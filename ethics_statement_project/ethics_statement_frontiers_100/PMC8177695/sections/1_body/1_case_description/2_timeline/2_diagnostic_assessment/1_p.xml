<p>In addition to an abdominal and pelvic CT scan, the patient underwent further staging studies. These included a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which demonstrated a large heterogenous T2 bright lesion measuring 9 Ã—6 cm emerging from the posterior aspect of the right body of the pubis. The mass projected postero-superiorly with a large, 1 cm thick cartliagenous cap and an underlying stalk that communicated with the medullary cavity of the pelvis. There was also significant effacement of the bladder with compression of the right ureter and resulting hydronephrosis. There was no infiltration of any surrounding structures.</p>
