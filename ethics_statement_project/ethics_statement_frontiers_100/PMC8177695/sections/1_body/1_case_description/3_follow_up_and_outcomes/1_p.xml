<p>Post-operatively, the patient was allowed to fully weight bear and had a post-operative course consistent with a grade II Clavien-Dindo surgical complication (i.e., minor alteration to management) (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). She was successfully treated for a post-operative urinary tract infection, presumably related to her Foley catheter, with culture-specific oral antibiotics. Post-operative scans demonstrated adequate positioning of the graft with no immediate complications (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The resected retropubic mass was confirmed to be a grade one chondrosarcoma/atypical cartilaginous tumor on histopathological analysis. There was a &gt;1 mm clear margin circumferentially around the tumor which was completely intact with a thick fibrous capsule. She was discharged from the acute surgical ward to a local rehabilitation hospital on day 7. At the time of discharge home from the rehabilitation ward, the patient was able to ambulate independently with a frame for 30 meters and rise from supine to standing independently At the 2-week post-operative mark her surgical wounds were healing well with no signs of infection. At the 6-week post-operative mark, the patient was ambulating well with two crutches and had normal bowel and urinary continence. She still described some pain and discomfort at her pubis with a sense of decreasing movement and discomfort of the grafted area. At 6-month follow-up there was no clinical or radiological evidence of tumor recurrence and she was able to ambulate independently (
