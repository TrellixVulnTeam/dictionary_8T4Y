<p>Chondrosarcomas are malignant tumor of mesenchymal origin whose cells produce osteoid-free chondroid matrix and can arise 
 <italic>de novo</italic> or secondary to a pre-existing benign cartilaginous neoplasm (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). They are the second most common primary bone tumor, after osteosarcoma, and are most commonly found within the pelvis and proximal femur (

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Chondrosarcomas exist along a continuum of severity with low grade lesions exhibiting an indolent growth pattern, whilst high grade lesions readily metastasize and have a poor prognosis (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Patients almost always present with insidious and progressive pain, usually for months to years and especially at night (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Other common presentations include a palpable lump, pathological fracture and mass-effect symptoms including nerve impingement (
