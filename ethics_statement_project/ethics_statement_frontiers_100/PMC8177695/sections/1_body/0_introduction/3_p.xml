<p>Herein, we report on a novel technique in the surgical management of a large pelvic atypical cartilaginous tumor via anterior hemipelvectomy with iliac crest graft reconstruction. The tumor was classified as an atypical cartilaginous tumor emerging from the posterior aspect of the pubis causing significant displacement and obstruction of the pelvic viscera without any local infiltration. Due to the large mass resected, there was a need for reconstruction to prevent herniation which was achieved via computer-navigated resection followed by computer guided iliac crest autograft harvest. This case highlights key principles in orthopedic oncology as well as providing a unique approach to the management of a complex case.</p>
