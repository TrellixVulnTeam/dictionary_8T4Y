<p>Since my surgery I have observed reduced urinary frequency to only 2â€“3 times nightly and therefore much improved sleep. Also, I have much improved ease of bowel movements. My pain post-surgery was minimal and the use of strong pain medication only lasted 8 days. Additionally, after only 4 weeks, even with the extent of the surgery, I was able to move around the house unaided and walk for about 600 m in 20 min with the aid of my wheelie walker. Now, after 8 weeks I am walking over 1 km in 30 min also with the aid of my walker with current physio advice to start walking this distance unaided which I see as quite achievable.</p>
