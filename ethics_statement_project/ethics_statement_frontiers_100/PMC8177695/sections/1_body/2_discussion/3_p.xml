<p>Type 3 hemipelvectomies are relatively uncommon and account for ~10% of internal hemipelvectomies (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Traditionally, it was considered unnecessary to reconstruct following type III hemipelvectomies given the preserved continuity of the weight bearing axis and the potential complications associated with reconstruction (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). However, Imanshi et al. in 2015 reported two case reports of type 3 internal hemipelvectomies in which bladder herniation was noted to be a significant concern following pubic resection and recommended reconstruction with a non-bony material (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Similarly, von Rundstedt et al. and Arkoulis et al. both reported on cases of bladder herniation following type 3 internal hemipelvectomies (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The concern rising from these case reports is that previous reconstruction methods which relied on soft tissue have not provided enough rigidity or durability to prevent herniation. Whilst bone graft with internal fixation could be considered an option, the natural human pubic symphysis permits motion up to 2 mm of shift and 1 degree of rotation which would promote metal stress and potentially implant failure (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Therefore, we opted to use the iliac crest as bone graft and fix it via thick fiber wire sutures to allow sufficient post-operative movement to achieve a fibrous union much in the same way that the symphysis pubis is a fibrous joint. Computer navigation and preoperative 3D planning facilitated not only the planning and execution of the pubic osteotomies but also the accurate and safe harvest of iliac bone to reconstruct the defect.
