<p>This case report provides an insight into the diagnosis and management of pelvic chondrosarcoma as well as a novel approach in its surgical resection and reconstruction. It has been well-established within the literature that pelvic chondrosarcoma is difficult to diagnose pre-operatively (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Firstly, whilst there are characteristic radiological appearances, it is difficult to distinguish chondrosarcomas from benign chondroid lesions (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Crim et al. demonstrated only a 21 and 58% sensitivity of plain radiographs and MRI for accurately diagnosing grade 1 chondrosarcomas (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Additionally histological diagnosis, especially in regards to pelvic chondrosarcoma, can be error-prone due to sampling misrepresentation and lack of consensus amongst experts (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Tsuda et al. estimated this error margin to be as high as 63% (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In our case, the initial histology and radiological investigations tended to favor a more benign cause such as osteochondroma. However, given the size and location of the tumor there was still a high index of suspicion that this tumor represented an atypical cartilaginous tumor and thus the treatment was tailored to this diagnosis.
