<p>Pelvic chondrosarcomas also represent a surgical challenge, with local recurrences rates being higher and the tumors conveying a poorer prognosis than peripheral bone chondrosarcomas (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). There are few anatomical barriers to extension within the pelvis and therefore the tumors are often exceptionally large and with higher grade behavior (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). With our resection we achieved a wide surgical margin (i.e., &gt;1 mm in all directions) for this grade 1 chrondrosarcoma/atypical cartilaginous tumor, whilst minimizing morbidity. In a multicenter study by Tsuda et al. this margin was considered the desired outcome for all pelvic chondrosarcomas as they can often be prone to inaccuracies in diagnosis and high local recurrence rates (
