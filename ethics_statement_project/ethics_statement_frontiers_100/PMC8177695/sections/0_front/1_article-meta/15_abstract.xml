<abstract>
 <p>We report on a case of a large atypical cartilaginous tumor of the pelvis and its novel surgical resection with an anterior hemipelvectomy and reconstruction with an iliac crest graft. Surgical intervention is the mainstay treatment of pelvic chondrosarcomas. However, there have been reports of concern regarding preventing pelvic visceral herniation and adequately reconstructing the pelvis. This report is unique within the literature and has yielded good functional outcomes whilst achieving satisfactory surgical margins and minimizing morbidity.</p>
