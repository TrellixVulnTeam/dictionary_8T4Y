<p>PLX4032-DR and Matrigel glue were mixed at a ratio of 1:1 and then subcutaneously injected into the left and right sides of 20 nude mice. When the tumor grew to a size large enough for further experiment, the mice were divided into 4 groups, namely, UMMD group, ultrasound group (US), micro Bubble group (MB) and control group (CON), with 5 mice in each group. According to a previous study (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), MBS was prepared, except for those in the US group and the CON group, each mouse was injected with MB suspension directly into the tumor, while the mice in the US group and the CON group were injected with the same amount of normal saline. Ultrasound treatment (1 mhz, 100% DC, 2.3W/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, 10s) in US group and UMMD group was performed on day 7, 8, 9, 11 and 13 after the MB perfusion. Tumor volume was measured and recorded once every 4 days after ultrasound treatment (V=0.5*longest axis*shortest axis
 <sup>2</sup>, mm). The mice were sacrificed 25 days after the perfusion, and the tumor volume and weight were carefully measured and calculated. The animal experiment was conducted strictly in accordance with the guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and was approved by the Ethics Committee of our hospital.
