<p>CCK-8 kit (Beyotime, C0037) was employed for examining the survival of PLX4032-DR. Specifically, the cells were inoculated into 96-well plates at 5*10
 <sup>4</sup>/well. After culturing for 24h, 48h, 72h, 96h, 10Î¼L CCK-8 reagent was added to each well. After 1-h incubation, the absorbance was measured at 450nm with a microplate reader.
