<p>RNA extraction kit (GBCBIO, R3105) was used to separate and purify RNA in the CMM tissues collected. M-MLV 4 reverse transcription kit (Biomed, MT403) was applied to synthesize first strand cDNA from RNA templates. TransScript
 <sup>Â®</sup> Green Two-Step Kit (Trans, AQ201) was employed for QPCR amplification. GAPDH served as an internal reference. See
