<p>Cavitation is a common mechanisms resulting in MB rupture in UMMD (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). At present, studies have found that the cavitation effect of UMMD can significantly reduce the survival of melanoma cells and improve the therapeutic effect of tumors (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). During the process of cavitation, when the oscillating MB gathers on the surface of cells or tissues, shear stress will be generated, leading to the deformation of MB or even rupture, and enhancing the temporary permeability of the cell membrane (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). When cells receive mechanical stress such as shear stress, they can regulate F-actin and AMOT in the cell to promote YAP1 dephosphorylation, successfully entering the nucleus and activating transcription (

On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that in EMT or metastatic cancer cells, the activation of YAP1 will up-regulate a variety of irons including acyl-CoA synthase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL 4) and transferrin receptor. Death regulators increase the sensitivity of cells to iron death (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Affected by cell density, YAP1 could act as a new determinant of iron ptosis, while by promoting cell resistance to apoptosis, YAP1 will greatly increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to iron death and may be resistant to YAP1 activated drug-resistant metastatic tumors, thus showing a therapeutic potential in cancers (
