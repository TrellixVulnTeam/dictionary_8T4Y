<p>The transcription of YAP1 and TAZ in the Hippo signaling pathway plays a critical role in mediating the resistance of major cancer treatment drugs, and is considered to play a major driving role in the development of resistance of BRAF- and KRAS- mutant cancer cells (

However, in this study, the mRNA expression of YAP1 in tumor tissues was irrelevant to the clinicopathological characteristics or the survival of CMM patients. To explain such results, we speculated that on one hand, mRNA expression YAP1 cannot accurately reflect the transcriptional activity of YAP1, on the other hand, the specific role of YAP1 in CMM still remains unclear. Kim etÂ al. (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) analyzed the clinical data of 88 local patients with uveal melanoma on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and discovered that YAP1 activity is irrelevant to tumor size, tumor stage, gene mutation or other clinicopathological characteristics. The YAP1 nuclear-positive patients did not show a lower survival rate, which also supports our speculation that YAP1 activity was not a carcinogene as strong as described in other studies. A recent study also found (
