<p>In summary, our research showed that the expression of YAP1 may not significantly promote the growth of CMM tumors. However, UMMD can greatly inhibit the growth of CMM tumors, and such an effect seems to be highly related to the expression of YAP1 in Ribo-seq. UMMD could promote YAP1 to enter the nucleus and increase the sensitivity of cells to iron death, thereby exerting a therapeutic effect, but the specific mechanism still requires further investigation in depth.</p>
