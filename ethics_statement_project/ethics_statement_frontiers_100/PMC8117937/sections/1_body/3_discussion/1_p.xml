<p>Ultrasound and contrast agent technologies have made significant progress. Ultrasound technologies such as tumor ultrasound imaging and UMMD witnessed an increasing application in disease monitoring, diagnosis and treatment (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). US promotes pressure and temperature through cavitation, sonoporation, or thermal effects, which further enhances self-generated or exogenously introduced MB to rupture after expansion in the target area, resulting in changes in the permeability of tissues and cells (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In the past, UMMD was often used to mechanically dissolve thrombus substances in cardiovascular diseases such as ischemia/reperfusion injury, myocardial infarction, and hypertension, in addition, as a carrier of drugs and nucleic acids, it is expected to become an adjuvant therapy for the treatment of patients with heart disease (

Latest advances showed that UMMD, which focuses on the target area with high precision and non-invasiveness, can significantly reduce the dose and toxicity of drugs, improve the efficiency of drug and gene delivery, showing a high effectiveness in treating specific cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma (

 <italic>in vivo</italic> animal model followed by ultrasound treatment can hinder tumor growth and improve the survival rate of mice (
