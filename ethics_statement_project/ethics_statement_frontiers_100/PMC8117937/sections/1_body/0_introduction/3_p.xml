<p>Ultrasound-mediated microbubble destruction (UMMD) is an effective technology with minimal invasiveness. By combining low-frequency ultrasound with microbubbles, cavitation, that is, pushing and pulling or shock waves, will be generated in the body. Cavitation is expected to provide a safe and effective new anti-cancer therapy for the clinical practice, because it can produce a biological barrier penetration, improve the efficiency of drug or gene delivery into tumor tissues, and activate the anti-tumor immune response (
