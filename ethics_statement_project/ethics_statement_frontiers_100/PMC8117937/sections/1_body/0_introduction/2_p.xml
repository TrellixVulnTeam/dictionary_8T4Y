<p>Recent studies have demonstrated that the activation and promotion of the core transcription factor YAP in the hippo signaling pathway (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) enhance drug resistance in anti-cancer treatments. Under PLX 4032 treatment, drug-resistant melanoma cells shows a higher level of YAP nuclear localization and transcription activity (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Previous study also points out that the increase of YAP1 in tumors with BRAF
 <sup>V600E</sup> mutation is a biomarker indicative of poor early response of patients (
