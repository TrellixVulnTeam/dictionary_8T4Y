<p>This experiment was the first to explore the clinical significance of YAP1 in CMM. The tumor tissue samples were collected from CMM patients, and we constructed a CMM animal model with PLX 4032 resistance to analyze the effect of UMMD treatment on YAP1 expression 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Noticeably, in addition to conventional RNA-seq and QPCR, this study also performed ribosomal blot sequencing (Ribo-seq), which directly detects protein translation at the gene level (
