<p>Further analysis of the relationship between the survival of CMM patients and YAP1 mRNA expression showed that although the 5-year survival rate of patients with high mRNA expression of YAP1 was slightly lower than that of those with low YAP1 mRNA expression, there was no statistical difference (Hazard Ratio (HR)=1.422, 95%) CI of ratio: 0.6043 to 3.347, 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.422), indicating that the survival of CMM patients is irrelevant to the level of YAP1 mRNA expression (
