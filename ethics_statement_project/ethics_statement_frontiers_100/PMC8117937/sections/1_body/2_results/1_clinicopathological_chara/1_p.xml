<p>The YAP1 mRNA expression level in the tumor tissues of 64 CMM patients was determined to be 1.264 Â± 0.105. According to the median expression level, the 64 patients were accordingly divided into high and low YAP1 mRNA expression groups. By comparing the relationship between mRNA expression of YAP1 and clinical pathological characteristics of the patients, we observed that YAP1 mRNA expression was irrelevant to the age, gender, lesion site, or cell subtype, etc. of CMM patients (
