<p>CCK-8 method was applied to detect the tumor cell growth, and the results showed that 1Î¼M PLX4032 did not affect the cell viability of PLX4032-DR A375 (
 <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05), indicating a successful establishment of the drug-resistant CMM cell line, which was then adequately mixed with Matrigel and injected into the skin of the nude mice. Subsequently, the corresponding treatment was carried out. The data revealed that compared with the CON group, the MB group showed limited effect on the volume and weight of tumors (
 <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05). However, the tumor volume and weight of the US and UMMB groups were significantly lower than those of the MB and CON groups (
