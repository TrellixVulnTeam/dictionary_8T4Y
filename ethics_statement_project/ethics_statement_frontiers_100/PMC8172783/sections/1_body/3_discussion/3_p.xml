<p>This study investigated the family dynamic structural features of intergenerational and non-intergenerational rearing families and their association with the anxiety and depression emotional characteristics of grandparents. The results revealed no significant differences in the family dynamic features and anxiety and depression between the two groups. The systemic logical dimension was inversely related to the total score of the depression and anxiety scales. The disease concept dimension was positively correlated with the total score of the depression and anxiety scales. The lower the score on this dimension, the lower the scores on the two scales. If elderly family members link disease and rehabilitation to self-response and subjective effort instead of regarding themselves as victims of diseases, depression and anxiety are unlikely to occur.</p>
