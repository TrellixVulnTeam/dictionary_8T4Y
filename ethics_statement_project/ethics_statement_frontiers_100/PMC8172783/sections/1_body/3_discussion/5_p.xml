<p>This research was unable to clarify the differences in the family dynamic structure between intergenerational and non-intergenerational rearing and the impact of the former on the elderly, the current study provided evidence for an association between the family dynamic structure and the elderly's depression and anxiety. The influence of family on the psychological health of the elderly cannot be disregarded because it is the most important living environment for aging individuals. Intergenerational rearing problems need to be considered in different respects In the future, more research effort should focus on the relations between family dynamics and elderly people's mental health conditions. Limitations As the research focused on the elderly, for whom the concepts of family dynamics were relatively abstract, it was challenging to avoid the occurrence of bias in their responses. This resulted in some interference with the findings. The representativeness of this research is limited because the sample comprised elderly individuals belonging to the same community. Therefore, to improve the investigation, the sample needs to be extended to different areas, and the quality of the survey questionnaires should be strictly controlled. Additional targeted research conclusions will be explored after an in-depth analysis of the results.</p>
