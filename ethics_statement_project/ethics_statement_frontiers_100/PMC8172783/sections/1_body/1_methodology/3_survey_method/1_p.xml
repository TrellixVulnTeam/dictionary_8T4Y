<p>The survey comprised an on-site questionnaire conducted by several professional evaluators who underwent a standardized training. They briefly explained the questionnaire through standard instructions prior to the survey; it was later completed by the participants independently. The evaluators provided appropriate explanations to those individuals who had any related queries. All the survey forms were collected immediately; the data were checked, and entered using Epidata version 3.1; a logical test was performed in order to exclude invalid questionnaires.</p>
