<p>The GDS (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), which is aims at depression assessment of elderly people aged over 56 years, was developed in 1982 by Brank et al. It evaluates their most relevant feelings over a 1-week period, and contains 15 columns. The scores reflect the state of depression, with 0–4 points referred to as normal, and 5–8, 9–11, and 12–15 points as mild, moderate, and major depression, respectively. The Cronbach's coefficient is 0.64 for GDS in the current research.
