<p>The 20-item SAS is a self-rating measure including 20 items (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). It evaluates the user's subjective feelings during the last week, and the scores are divided into 4 degrees. The first, second, third, and fourth levels refer to no, sometimes yes, frequently yes, and almost yes or yes, respectively. The cut-off score of 41 may indicate an anxiety condition. The Cronbach's coefficient is 0.77 for SAS in the current research.
