<p>Non-participant observations were made following a structured observation scheme. The focus was on the question how CESS members fulfilled their role during consultations and how they introduced and described themselves and their role. When possible, the observer also took notes of the CESS members' impressions of the consultation subsequently. All notes were protocolled manually and transcribed within the same day. The cases were observed in two different psychiatric hospitals and a psychiatric long-term care facility in western Germany.</p>
