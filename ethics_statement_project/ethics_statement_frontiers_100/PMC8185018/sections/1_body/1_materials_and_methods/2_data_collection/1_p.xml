<p>We chose an explorative qualitative approach triangulating different data sources (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Triangulation of different data sources can be used to mitigate bias and increase saturation. It is especially suitable for novel research questions and exploratory studies in which small sample sizes are to be expected and little is known about the phenomena in question. Data were collected from interviews with mental health professionals and CESS members. In addition, we conducted non-participant observations of ethical case consultations in different mental healthcare institutions.
