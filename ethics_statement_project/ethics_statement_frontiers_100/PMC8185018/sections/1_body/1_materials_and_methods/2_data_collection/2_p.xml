<p>The interviews followed a semi-structured guideline comprising three main parts: The first part aimed at learning more about the participants' professional expertise and their experiences with CESS.

Cards were iteratively supplemented with participants' suggestions and included 20 different properties and skills an ethics consultant might be equipped with to fulfill his/her professional role. All participants were invited to rank the importance of the properties or skills on a five-point scale while commenting on their decisions. Interviews were conducted from January 2018 to June 2019 in four different psychiatric hospitals in two different federal states in western Germany.
