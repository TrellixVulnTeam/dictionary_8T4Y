<p>Preliminary categories were constructed by the main author (JH) based on the first interviews and observations. The initial coding was presented within the research group and discussed during several presentations. These categories served as a basis for the analysis of the remaining material. Finally, all categories were generalized through axial coding. The emerging themes were discussed with several external experts and then presented to national and international experts from the field of clinical ethics consultation or psychiatry and to interview participants on several occasions. Data analysis was used to inform conceptual analysis from a normative perspective. The data analysis was ended after theoretical saturation, that is, the point during the study at which essential changes in the coding by the emergence of new data material was deemed to be unlikely by the researchers.</p>
