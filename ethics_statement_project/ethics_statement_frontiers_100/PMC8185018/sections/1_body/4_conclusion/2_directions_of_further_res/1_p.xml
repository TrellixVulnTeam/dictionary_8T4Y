<p>Our study warrants further research regarding the ethical problem types in psychiatry and the professional role of an ethicist, putting ethical expertise at its core. The findings concerning the typology of ethical problems show, firstly, a need for research concerning the handling of triangular problems. So far, ethics in psychiatry has devoted comparatively little attention to the question of what an ethically justified distribution of burdens might look like in these cases. Accordingly, there are few points of reference that could help CESS members to translate these difficult theoretical questions into practical counseling processes and ethical recommendations. Secondly, the handling of intersystem problems raises questions concerning the conceptual nature of CESS as an initially clinical intervention that focuses on the relationship between professionals and patients. In mental healthcare – more than elsewhere – CESS members are confronted with ethical challenges that go far beyond this relationship. The fact that this type of ethical problem often cannot be resolved satisfactorily within the limits of CESS and that it can result in non-optimal ethical recommendations can compromise the acceptance of CESS among mental health professionals and the implementation of CESS in mental healthcare institutions. Further research is needed to investigate the quality and quantity of the occurrence of such cases in clinical contexts. In addition, existing strategies of handling and communication need to be reconstructed by means of social science research to generate starting points for the implementation of targeted and practical recommendations for improvements.</p>
