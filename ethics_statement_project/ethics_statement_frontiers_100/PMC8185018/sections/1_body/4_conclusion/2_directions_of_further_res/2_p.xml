<p>Regarding the roles of ethical experts and the professional roles of CESS members in psychiatry, a more systematic development of the professional role of ethics consultants is needed. The role of an ethicist is poorly defined compared to other professional roles in healthcare. However, this is not only because these roles are still at an early stage of development but is due, above all, to the special nature of ethical expertise, which seems to differ from other forms of expertise. There are currently only a few approaches in the theoretical literature to a consistent conceptualization of the specific roles of ethics consultants, which urgently need to be developed further.</p>
