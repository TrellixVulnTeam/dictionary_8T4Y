<p>Qualitative research enables the exploration of complex social phenomena and underlying assumptions, such as typologies of ethical problems and concepts of expertise, within their native social horizon. In our study, the qualitative data form the basis of a normative and conceptual analysis. This has the strength of ensuring that the theoretical work on concepts is grounded in empirical data and is, hence, both practically relevant and real-world oriented. It creates the opportunity to generate generalizable hypotheses on the challenges highlighted above and sketch ways to improve CESS in psychiatry.</p>
