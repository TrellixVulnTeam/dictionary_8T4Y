<p>Limitations to be considered in qualitative research concern, 
 <italic>inter alia</italic>, representativity and transferability of the results. It must be stated clearly that results gained in this study cannot be representative due to the qualitative methods applied. Furthermore, the relatively small sample size limits the transferability of our results. In addition, the fact that we gathered our data in the specific German mental healthcare context reduces the scope of our results. We neither want nor are able to make any statement concerning a correlation between a certain institutional or societal context and the occurrence or frequency of any type of ethical problem. These limitations may also influence our normative analysis in terms of the accuracy of the conceptual model as its grade of detail corresponds with the explorative approach of the study. However, this does not limit the applicability of the model itself as a helpful tool for the further advancement of CESS in mental healthcare and especially in psychiatric hospitals.
