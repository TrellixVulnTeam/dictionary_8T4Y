<p>Dyadic problems are directly connected to the doctor-patient relationship between individual patients and mental health professionals. They often develop between patient autonomy, on the one hand, and duties to beneficence in medical care, on the other. Although these cases raise serious ethical questions and require careful consideration, our data show that existing structures, including CESS, can deal with them adequately. Cases of this type have, therefore, rarely been a cause for concern in our sample.</p>
