<p>Although this tension might be ubiquitous in CESS and may never be released completely due to its conceptual nature (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), we suspect its practical emergence to be more typical in mental healthcare. One of the reasons could be the flatter hierarchies in many psychiatric settings. These make it easier to question the status and role of experts and expert knowledge. Another reason could be the relatively small number of case consultations in psychiatry. This implies that there is less experience among professionals and the development of stable professional roles might be still at an early stage. We suggest, however, that this tension needs to be acknowledged as a practical fact that may lead to severe frustration and misunderstanding in CESS members. It should, at least, be mitigated as far as possible in clinical practice to avoid feeling torn apart between the two poles of this professional role. As a starting point, this requires CESS members to be aware of the special difficulties of their expert status and to include constant reflection of one's own position into the training and education of CESS members. A deeper understanding of the typology of ethical problems, as we have developed it here, is an important component to be able to assess the possibilities and the limits of one's own expertise better. It should, therefore, be taken into account in the training and further education of CESS members in psychiatry. A second measure, here, is to emphasize not only the differences and individuality of CESS in psychiatry but also the similarities with somatic medicine. In essence, the question of professional identity concerns all ethical experts. A stronger exchange, for example, through interdepartmental consultations, would contribute to a further development of existing roles on all sides and make it possible to create additional opportunities for exchange and experiences.
