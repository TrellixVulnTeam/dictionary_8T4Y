<p>Triangular problems also emerge from the relationship between patients and professionals but involve a third party as the bearer of burden whose interest is at stake. Triangular problems pose a certain challenge for the practice of CESS in psychiatry for two reasons. Firstly, these cases are more complex in structure than dyadic problems. There are, for example, more stakeholders whose indirect involvement may be more difficult to assess and evaluate. Secondly, triangular problems raise a need for further theoretical clarification, especially regarding the underlying ethical questions. In many cases, triangular problems are concerned with the fair distribution of burdens. Should, for example, an individual coercive measure (such as seclusion or mechanical restraint) be applied against the will of a person under involuntary commitment who poses a danger to self or to others and repeatedly tries to abscond from an open ward, in order to maintain an open door for all other patients? Such a measure would mean a much stronger restriction of freedom for this individual person while it might benefit others (

Or vice versa: Do all other patients in this case have to accept a stronger restriction of their freedom than needed in order to minimize the burden for their fellow patient as far as possible? Problems of this kind have rarely been discussed in the literature of ethics in psychiatry. As a consequence, there is a lack of concrete ethical approaches concerning the question of how the burdens could be distributed in an ethically justifiable manner to which CESS could refer.
