<p>Consequently, this would change the nature of CESS significantly compared to their original direct clinical focus. It also requires careful and resource-intensive training of the CESS members and, once again, underlines the importance of ethical expertise as the core of CESS. Our data show a strong inner tension regarding this core of a professional ethicist's role. On the one hand, ethical experts are understood to be neutral people equipped with skills and knowledge to detect and analyze ethical problems. These people's task is to bring together all perspectives on an equal footing. On the other hand, professional ethicists are expected to give advice and guidance and defend ethically justified options in consultations to pave the way for further actions. The CESS members struggle with this role, feeling torn apart between its poles and sometimes even feel unable to satisfy the demands from both sides. Data show considerable inconclusiveness in statements about the professional identities of CESS members. This inconclusiveness of participants' statements mirrors a conceptual problem. As Iltis and Sheehan (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) rightly note, there is a considerable clash between being an expert and exercising advice in the domain of ethics: Expert recommendations give strong reasons to act in accordance with them and experts are mostly appreciated for this guiding force. However, the special character of ethics that assigns moral responsibility to the acting agent seems to preclude giving such authority to others over one's own ethical decisions (
