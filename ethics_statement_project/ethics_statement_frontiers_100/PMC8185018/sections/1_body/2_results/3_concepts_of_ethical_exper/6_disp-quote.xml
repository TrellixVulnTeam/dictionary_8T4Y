 <p>I just remembered; I was at law school. Once I was at a court hearing where a judge pronounced a judgement and afterwards, when the students were there, he gave himself time to explain why he had just made that decision. And I found that incredibly helpful, because from the outside, his considerations, which he took into account, that was for me, ehm, I could understand this decision much better and I think maybe in such things the issue simply overlaps a bit.
