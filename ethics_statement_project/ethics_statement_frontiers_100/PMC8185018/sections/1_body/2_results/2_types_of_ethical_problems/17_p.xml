<p>These problems evolve around different parts of the healthcare system. These different actors (e.g. different wards, hospitals or services outside the institution, such as ambulance services) often follow different rationales concerning the use of different resources to fulfill their purpose. Study participants were severely concerned about problems in which, for example, a different prioritization of resources led to a clash between two or more actors. Regarding the latter quote: While there seem to be ethically justified reasons to adopt an open-door policy to reduce coercion, such an approach might stress the resources of the ambulance services as some patients absconded from the ward and then had to be brought back. As was recalled by the interviewee, the paramedics accused him of an unjustified use of their resources since their necessary reaction prevented them from being available for other (perhaps more urgent) calls at the same time.</p>
