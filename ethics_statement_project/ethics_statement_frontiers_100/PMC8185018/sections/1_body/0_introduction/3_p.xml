<p>In addition to organizational and structural challenges, such as lack of resources or support (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), the successful implementation of CESS in psychiatry seems to hinge, 
 <italic>inter alia</italic>, on two important challenges. Firstly, interventions must be able to respond adequately to the moral distress of mental health professionals (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Moral distress is a psychological response which includes the experience of suffering (e.g., from anxiety, fear or anguish) connected to moral dilemmas, uncertainty or certainty accompanied by constraints (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Successful CESS, therefore, requires an understanding of the nature of an incoming request for support and the ability to tailor interventions to the needs of mental health professionals and the specific type of problem. Secondly, CESS members need to develop a professional role as ethicists on an equal footing with other professional roles in healthcare settings. This would allow the delimitation of their service from other interventions and to display their range of expertise and the value of ethical support clearly (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, very little is known about the ethical problems mental health professionals want to refer to CESS and how professional ethicist roles should be developed.
