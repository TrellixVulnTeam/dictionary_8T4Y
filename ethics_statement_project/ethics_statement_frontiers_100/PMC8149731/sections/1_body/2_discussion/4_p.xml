<p>Our case demonstrated that endothelial dysfunction may be present at a very early stage of Covid-19 infection and seems to be partly persistent even if SARS-CoV-2 is not detectable anymore. Our patient was asymptomatic at the time of verified Covid-19 infection when measurements of vascular reactivity and arterial stiffness were performed and symptoms occurred a few days later. It needs to be elucidated if parameters differ between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients as well as between patients with a different severity of symptoms. Furthermore, it needs to be elucidated if parameters of vascular reactivity and arterial stiffness remain altered as a long-term consequence of Covid-19 or if these changes may be present only in the acute phase of this infection. Moreover, studies evaluating parameters of vascular reactivity and arterial stiffness as potential predictors for cardiovascular events and mortality need to be performed.</p>
