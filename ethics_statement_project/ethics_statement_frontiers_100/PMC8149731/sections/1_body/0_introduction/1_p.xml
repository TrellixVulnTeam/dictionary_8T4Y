<p>Covid-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) affecting primarily the respiratory system. Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities have an increased risk of in-hospital death and Covid-19 infection may lead to a higher risk of cardiovascular complications like heart failure, venous thromboembolism or stroke (
