<p>Important information obtained from national surveys around sexuality and sexual health such as the Australian Study of Health and Relationships (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and the British National Surveys of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) aid policy makers in the development strategies for the improvement of sexual health in the general population (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Unfortunately, these surveys often exclude institutionalized populations and underrepresent marginalized groups (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Very few studies have evaluated the sexuality and sexual health of mental health patients despite the clinical knowledge that holistic sexual functioning is impacted by the combination of (a) the symptoms of mental illness, (b) social and interpersonal impairments, (c) institutionalization and (d) psychotropic medication (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). All of these factors are much more profound in forensic mental health patients. There are no large-scale studies that have gathered quantitative or qualitative data on the sexuality and sexual health needs of forensic mental health patients. This dearth in research then creates a vacuum in the information available for patients and clinicians to support evidence-based treatment decisions.
