<p>Clinically it is important to explore mental health in relation to sexuality and sexual health for several reasons. Firstly, McCann et al. (

The fulfillment of sexuality and sexual health is tied to the extent to which human rights are respected, protected, and fulfilled and sexual rights are already recognized in international and regional human rights documents (
