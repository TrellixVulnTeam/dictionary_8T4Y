<p>This elderly patient we reported had a 15-year history of primary SS presenting with a 4-year history of progressive muscle weakness of lower limbs. Brain MRI demonstrated diffuse brain atrophy, especially in the hippocampus. She was initially considered to have primary degenerative dementia related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Misdiagnosis of AD could lead to different therapeutic outcomes since the autoimmune-related cognitive dysfunction is often reversible. However, the patient's symptoms worsened 2 months before admission, she had a rapid decline in cognitive function and memory impairment. We found that diffuse brain atrophy were progressive in this patient by comparing her present brain MRI with that of 1 year before the onset of cognitive dysfunction. However, in addition to the brain atrophy, there were scattered foci of T2-FLAIR hyperintensity within the periventricular, deep and subcortical white matter of the frontoparietal lobe. These were new lesions. As for this patient, anti-NR1 subunit of NMDAR antibody was detected with a titer of 1:100 in both CSF and serum by using the technique of CBA and rat brain immunostaining. Thus, the diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis combined with primary SS was established eventually. Subsequent remarkable response to immunotherapy further confirmed the diagnosis. We think that the patient's encephalitis may start 2 months before admission. The chronic cognitive impairment in the previous years probably is due to other causes such as cerebral ischemia and brain atrophy.</p>
