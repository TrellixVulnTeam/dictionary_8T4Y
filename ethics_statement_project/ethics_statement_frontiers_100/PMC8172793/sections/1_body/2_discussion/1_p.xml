<p>Neuropsychiatric (NP) events are commonly found in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary SS. Previous studies demonstrated that circulating autoantibodies to the NR2 subunit of NMDAR was associated with the cognitive dysfunction and psychiatric disease (

 <sub>B</sub>R) encephalitis coexisting with primary SS, respectively, but none of the 307 patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis was coexisting with primary SS. The correlation between anti-NMDAR encephalitis and primary SS is yet to be clarified.
