<p>Cognitive impairment is not unusual in primary SS. Tezcan et al. reported that 39.2% of primary SS patients had moderate or severe cognitive dysfunction (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Consequently, in terms of progressive cognitive dysfunction, autoimmune encephalitis should be taken into account and latent tumors need to be screened. Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is a potentially lethal but treatable autoimmune disorder. For this reason, early recognition and initiation of treatment are of great significance to facilitate a favorable outcome. This unique case emphasizes the need for a suspicion of anti-NMDAR encephalitis when approaching a primary SS patient with a decline in cognitive function.
