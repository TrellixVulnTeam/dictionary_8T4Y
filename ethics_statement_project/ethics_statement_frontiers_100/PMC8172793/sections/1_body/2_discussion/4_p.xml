<p>Interestingly, anti-AQP4 IgG antibody was weakly positive in serum but not in CSF. As we know, the water channel protein AQP4 is expressed in the foot-processes of astrocytes throughout the central nervous system, and is the target of anti-AQP4-IgG in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD). There has been evidence that anti-NMDAR encephalitis could coexist with NMOSD sequentially or simultaneously (

In fact, Zhao et al. have reported that multiple autoantibodies could be present in the same patient with autoimmune encephalitis, including the coexistence of anti-NMDAR and anti-AQP4 antibodies (1/307) (
