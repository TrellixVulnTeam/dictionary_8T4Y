<p>A 76-year-old woman presented with a 4-year history of progressive muscle weakness of lower limbs. At the early stage, she still could walk without any aids. One year ago, a brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) scan revealed multiple ischemic lesions, white matter degeneration and encephalatrophy, including hippocampal atrophy (

One month before admission, she began to experience a decline in cognitive function and short-term memory deficit. Additionally, she was diagnosed with primary SS 15 years ago and treated with prednisone for 1 year. She denied any history of hypertension, diabetes and heart diseases.
