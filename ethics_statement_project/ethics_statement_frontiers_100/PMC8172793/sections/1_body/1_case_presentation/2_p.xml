<p>The patient was first admitted to the Department of Neurology in September 2019. On admission, she had decreased consciousness, barylalia, and disorientation. Muscle strength of lower limbs was grade II. Cognitive dysfunction was confirmed through the tests of Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment and clock drawing. Laboratory tests were as follows: peripheral white blood cell (WBC) was 7.8 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L (4–10). Urinalysis, renal and liver functions were normal. Thyroid examination revealed she had Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed 2 leukocytes, elevated protein level of 0.95 g/L (0.15~0.45) and normal glucose. The oligoclonal band (OB) was present in CSF. Transfection of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells with NR1 subunit or NR1-NR2B subunits of NMDAR was performed to test for the presence of NMDAR antibody (

Results showed that the anti-NMDAR was positive with a titer of 1:100 in both serum and CSF, and anti-aquaporin (AQP) 4 immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody was weakly positive in serum. Pathogen detection was negative in the CSF. High-resolution computed tomography scan revealed interstitial lung disease. Brain MRI showed new scattered foci of T2-weighted-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity within the periventricular, deep and subcortical white matter of the frontoparietal lobe without post-contrast enhancement (
