<p>Primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands resulting in dry mouth and dry eyes (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Many organs other than the exocrine glands may be affected including the skin, joints, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, liver, and the kidneys. In addition to the extraglandular involvement, the patients with primary SS may exhibit a variety of peripheral neuropathies and/or central nervous system (CNS) manifestations. Neurological manifestations may be the first clinical manifestation in 25–60% of patients with primary SS and precede the diagnosis of primary SS on an average of 2 years (

Tezcan et al. reported that 39.2% of primary SS patients had moderate or severe cognitive dysfunction unrelated to the anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antibody, anti-ribosomal-p and anti-ganglioside antibodies (

Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is the most prevalent autoimmune encephalitis involving anti-NMDAR antibodies, which is specific to the NR1 subunit of the NMDAR, and predominates in young women and children despite affecting people of any age (
