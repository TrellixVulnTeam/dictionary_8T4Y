  <p>Sémont maneuver (SM, two left columns) and Sémont PLUS maneuver (SM+, two right columns with overextension of the head by 60+° toward the affected side) for the treatment of pcBPPVcan. First and third column: maneuver performed by a physician (M.S.). Second column: movement of the clot of otoconia within the left posterior canal, based on a biomechanical model of BPPV (
   <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). 
   <bold>(A)</bold> upright position; 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Position of the clot after a 90° movement of the patient to the left: clot does not reach the lowest point; 
   <bold>(C,D)</bold> The clot can therefore fall back into the direction of the ampulla, leading to an unsuccessful maneuver. Third column: 
   <bold>(A+)</bold> upright position. 
   <bold>(B+)</bold> movement of the body by 150° toward the affected side moves the otoconia farther in the direction in which they should move. 
   <bold>(C+)</bold> Since the clot is beyond the vertex, the movement of body by 240° moves the clot in the direction 
   <bold>(D+)</bold> of the vestibulum.
