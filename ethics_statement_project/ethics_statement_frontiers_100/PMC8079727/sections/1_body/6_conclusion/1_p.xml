<p>This prospective randomized trial provides Class I evidence that SM+ is more effective than SM for the treatment of pcBPPVcan when repeated therapeutic self-maneuvers are performed but not when a single maneuver is performed. This is in line with the findings of the biophysical model: overextension of the head during step 2 of SM+ brings the clot of otoconia beyond the vertex of the canal, which increases the efficacy. Therefore, for clinical practice SM+ can be recommended for most patients.</p>
