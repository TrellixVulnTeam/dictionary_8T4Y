<p>This study has several limitations: first, one of the endpoints was based on a self-reported outcome by the patient and not by re-examination of the patient by a physician. However, patients received detailed instructions and used a standardized questionnaire. Furthermore, since symptoms typically first occur and re-occur in the early morning and then improve during daytime, a reevaluation in the hospital may also give false normal findings because patients might have already transiently recovered before reaching the hospital. Finally, treatment of the patient with benign PPV on a ward until recovery or recurrent daily visits to document the treatment effects is not practical and again does not reflect real world procedures. Second, in this study only the effects of a single therapeutic maneuver in combination with recurrent self-maneuvers by the patients were evaluated. Therefore, we cannot make a statement about the efficacy of repeated maneuvers performed by physicians or physiotherapists. Third, we did not specifically evaluate the side effects of both maneuvers or the impact of the maneuvers on quality of life or functioning.</p>
