<p>Second, the immediate success rate of a 
 <italic>single</italic> maneuver was low, and there was no difference between the success rate of a single SM (48%) and a single SM+ (56%). This finding is in line with previous studies showing that a single maneuver is not sufficient for a successful treatment of pc-BPPV (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Therefore, the study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of multiple maneuvers, thereby also reflecting real world procedures for the treatment of BPPV in clinical practice: the combination of the first maneuver by the therapist in the office and subsequent self-maneuvers by the patient at home after receiving detailed instructions on how to perform the maneuvers, which was also developed, used, and recommended in other studies (

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). At least for the Epley maneuver, the efficacy of the self-maneuver was shown to be higher than that of the Epley maneuver alone (
