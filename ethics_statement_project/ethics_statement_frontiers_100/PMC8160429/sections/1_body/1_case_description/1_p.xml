<p>A previously healthy 12-year-old boy was transferred to our institution from a local hospital on the 3rd day after falling from a height of 15 meters. Chest X-ray and whole-body computed tomography (CT) scan on the day of the injury showed multiple traumas, including pulmonary contusion, renal injury, and multiple rib fractures. The following day, two blood cultures were taken because of high fever (39.3Â°C) and elevated inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP) (45 mg/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (70 mm/h), and leukocytosis (19,300/mm
 <sup>3</sup>). The patient was treated with cefotaxime for presumed sepsis but had no clinical improvement. Nevertheless, according to the referral notes, the patient's vital signs were normal except for tachycardia (130 bpm).
