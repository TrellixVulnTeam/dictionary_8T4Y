<p>When he arrived at our institution, he required mechanical ventilation for progressively worsening dyspnea. A widened pulse pressure was noted (120/40 mmHg), which the critical care physician considered to be a manifestation of intracranial or spine injuries. He had a regular heart rate of 120 bpm, while his respiratory rate and oxygen saturations were normal under mechanical ventilation. Physical examination revealed moist rales over both lungs, a heart murmur that was difficult to characterize due to the tachycardia, and no abdominal or pelvic mass was detected on palpation. On the day of admission, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and cardiomegaly were noted on the chest X-ray (

A contrast-enhanced CT scan showed pulmonary contusions, hemopneumothorax, renal laceration, and multiple bone fractures, including ribs, pelvis and lumbar vertebra. Cardiac severe injuries, such as aortic dissection, aortic aneurysm, and cardiac tamponade, were not found (

However, the anatomy of cardiac valves and color Doppler flow images not well-visualized because of the patient's body habitus and hemopneumothorax. Based on suggestions from multidisciplinary consultation, conservative treatment, including respiratory support, anti-infection, and external fixation to stabilize the fracture., was preferred for this patient.
