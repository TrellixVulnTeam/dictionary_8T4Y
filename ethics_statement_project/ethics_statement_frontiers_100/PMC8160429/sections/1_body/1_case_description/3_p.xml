<p>On the 2nd day after admission, the inflammatory markers remained elevated (CRP 66 mg/L, ESR 90 mm/h, and leukocytosis 21,300/mm
 <sup>3</sup>), and blood cultures yielded meropenem-susceptible pseudomonas aeruginosa. Mild increases in myocardial injury biomarkers, including cardiac troponin I (CTnI) (2.5 ng/ml), creatine kinase MB (CKMB) (120 U/L) and N-terminal of prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP) (750 pg/ml), were considered common in BCT and had not been paid adequate attention. After the administration of sensitive antibiotics, his fever did not abate until 14 days after admission, by which time his blood cultures had turned negative and inflammatory markers had returned to normal. Contradictory to the improvement in sepsis and pulmonary contusions, he developed recurrent hemoptysis on admission day 17 and could not be weaned from the ventilator. His diastolic blood pressure remained low (30–45 mmHg) and myocardial injury biomarkers (CTnI 3.42 ng/ml, CKMB 301 U/L and NT-pro BNP 14,376 pg/ml) were getting higher despite multiple measurements of normal left ventricular ejection fraction(65–75%). Repeated chest radiographs suggested pulmonary edema. Catheter angiography was intentionally performed on day 21 after admission to rule out the post-traumatic pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysms and ruptured bronchial artery aneurysm. However, the aortic angiogram unexpectedly showed wide-open aortic insufficiency (
