<p>The patient underwent cardiac surgery on admission day 25 after diuretic treatment. The intraoperative view revealed the morphologically normal NCC and RCC were torn entirely off from the annulus. The damaged valves were then excised and replaced with bovine pericardium tissue valves. Histopathological examination of the valves demonstrated no evidence of any inflammation. Postoperative TEE showed well-functioning new valves without regurgitation (

The levels of CTnI, CKMB, and NT-pro BNP gradually declined and reached near the baseline level on post-operative day 10. He had no recurrent hemoptysis but had a prolonged intensive care unit stay due to ventilator-associated pneumonia. He was weaned off from the ventilator 14 days after the surgery and was ultimately discharged to a rehabilitation facility in stable condition on postoperative day 30. The timeline illustrating the diagnostic workup and therapeutic process is shown in
