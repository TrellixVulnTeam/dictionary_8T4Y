 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), while 3 were found to have new heart murmurs or heart failure symptoms 7 days, 6 weeks, and 1 month after trauma, respectively (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Valvular dysfunction can gradually worsen to symptomatic heart failure and results in significant morbidity and mortality if not diagnosed early.
