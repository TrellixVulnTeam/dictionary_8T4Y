<p>Severe AR is a medical emergency mainly caused by bicuspid aortic valve, endocarditis, rheumatic fever, and catheter-related injury. However, traumatic AVR after BCT is rarely encountered in the pediatric trauma population, and little attention has been paid to such damages (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The traumatic AR mechanism has been reported as a sudden increase of intra-thoracic pressure during the cardiac cycle's diastolic phase when the trans-aortic gradient is maximal, and this high pressure caused commissure dehiscence or aortic cusp rupture. NCC is most frequently involved due to no coronary artery buffers against hemodynamic stress (
