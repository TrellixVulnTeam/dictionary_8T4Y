<p>Patients with BCT should be repeatedly evaluated by physical examination and echocardiography to rule out cardiac injuries, especially valvular damage with an insidious onset and a slow progression. TEE should be performed to visualize intracardiac structures better if the images of TTE are suboptimal due to mechanical ventilation or other coexistent injuries (

AVR should be highly suspected in patients presenting with widened pulse pressure, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, and diastolic heart murmur at the left lower sternal border. Elevated cardiac biomarkers including CKMB, CTnI, and NT-pro BNP also have a role in predicting cardiac injury. Early identification of AVR leads to an appropriate treatment strategy and improves prognosis. Aortic valve replacement, rather than repair, is the primary treatment modality because of avulsion injury or weakness of the remaining leaflet tissue, and the overall prognosis is good (
