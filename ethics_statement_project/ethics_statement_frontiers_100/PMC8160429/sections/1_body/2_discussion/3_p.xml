<p>Several factors may be responsible for the late detection of AVR in this patient (21 days after BCT). First, the poor acoustic windows due to the patient's body habitus and hemopneumothorax hindered an accurate evaluation of the cardiac valves by portable TTE (

The use of the S8-3 cardiac sector probe in this patient may also be an important reason for missed diagnosis because this type of cardiac probe may not obtain clear color Doppler blood flow signals in older children. Secondly, the presentation of acute AR after BCT may be insidious at the early stage but progress slowly, cardiac injury without immediate circulatory collapse may be masked by the consequences of multiple traumatic injuries. Finally, timely recognition of characteristic murmur of AR is challenging for non-cardiologists, especially in the setting of respiratory distress and tachycardia (
