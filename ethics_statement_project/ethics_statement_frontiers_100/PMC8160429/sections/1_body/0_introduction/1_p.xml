<p>Traumatic injury remains the primary cause of mortality in the pediatric population, and the incidence of blunt chest trauma (BCT) has continuously risen in the past few years (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), mainly owing to increasing numbers of automobile accidents or falls from a height. The cardiac injury occurs in up to 76% of BCT patients (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), and the predominant types are wall rupture and contusion, while valve injury is infrequent, affecting only 0.85% of the pediatric cardiac injury population (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Although the aortic valve is the most commonly injured valve, only one case of aortic valve rupture (AVR) was seen in an autopsy series of 546 deaths due to BCT (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), and only 95 cases of aortic regurgitation (AR) after BCT have been reported all over the world up to 2015 (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Traumatic AVR is even more unusual in the pediatric literature, with only 5 cases reported, and the youngest was 15 years of age (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Thus, timely diagnosis of AVR may not be easy at the initial assessment if the manifestations of AR were masked by the consequences of coexistent injuries, especially when cardiac involvement is not suspected. Here We report a case of delayed diagnosis of AVR after falling from a height of 15 meters, who presented with recurrent hemoptysis and ventilator dependence.
