  <p>A pigtail catheter was advanced for the aortic and pulmonary angiogram. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Aortic angiogram showed severe diastolic retrograde flow (white arrow) from the AAO to the LV. No enlarged or ruptured bronchial arteries, which may be responsible for hemoptysis, were found to originate from the supra-aortic branches or DAO. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Pulmonary angiogram showed no pulmonary vascular abnormalities responsible for hemoptysis, such as post-traumatic PA pseudoaneurysms and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. AAO, ascending aorta; DAO, descending aorta; LV, left ventricle; PA, pulmonary artery.
