<p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by frequent pulmonary exacerbations resulting in bronchiectasis, irreversible lung damage and eventually lung failure. The path of disease progression is established early in life with lung damage already evident in patients with CF as early as 6 years of age (

Neutrophils are not only important effectors of bacterial phagocytosis, but they also dominate the inflammatory response. In the CF airways, neutrophils show a dysfunctional phenotype that deviates from their wild type counterparts (
