<p>We hypothesize that evidence of heightened neutrophil degranulation within the lungs of CF patients early in life will correlate with enhanced pulmonary injury later in life. Here we examined pulmonary proteins from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in the first years of life that may be predictive of CF disease severity later in life. In CF, signals of early neutrophil dysfunction could be used to identify patients at risk of following a more severe disease pathway. We therefore were specifically interested in defining the presence or absence of specific proteins that have been implicated in neutrophil biological activity. This study aimed to identify BAL fluid proteins present in early life that correlate with severity of CF lung disease after age 6.</p>
