<p>High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is accepted as a sensitive means of detecting early structural lung disease in CF, demonstrating abnormalities before the onset of clinical, spirometric, or plain radiographic abnormalities (

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) developed a sensitive, reproducible HRCT scoring system to evaluate CT features of CF lung disease suitable for use in children. Images are assessed for the lobar location and severity of morphological and parenchymal changes. These include bronchiectasis, peri-bronchial thickening, mucous plugging, atelectasis, consolidation, air/fluid levels, hyperinflation, and overall impression (
