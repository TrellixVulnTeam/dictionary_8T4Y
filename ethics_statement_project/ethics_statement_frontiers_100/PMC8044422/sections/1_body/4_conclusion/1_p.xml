<p>Identification of early biomarkers is particularly important in order to intervene in the progression of CF disease. We have shown that several neutrophil proteins in early CF BAL correlate with more severe lung disease later in childhood and therefore may be useful in identifying particularly vulnerable patient populations. Additionally, IL-22 may be a novel target to investigate in the inflammatory process in CF. We recommend further corroboration of these findings in prospective validation studies. This is the first description of early life IL-22 levels correlating with worse CF lung injury in later life.</p>
