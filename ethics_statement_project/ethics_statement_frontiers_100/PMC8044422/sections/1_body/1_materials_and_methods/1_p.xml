<p>BAL was obtained from 14 clinically stable infants and pre-school children (median age 2 years, range 1–5 years) with CF undergoing bronchoscopy as part of an annual surveillance program (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Clinical stability was defined as being asymptomatic with no change from baseline for 4 weeks prior to BAL. Bronchoscopy was performed through a laryngeal mask airway instilling 1 ml/kg sterile 0.9% NaCl per aliquot twice in the right middle lobe and twice in the lingula. Pooled aliquots were centrifuged at 10,000 ×

 <sup>TM</sup> protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher). A minimum concentration of 20/200 μl of each sample was shipped to SOMAscan for proteomic analysis. SOMAscan® is an aptamer-based affinity platform capable of measuring 1,305 human protein analytes in lung fluid with high sensitivity and specificity (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). High resolution computed tomography (HRCT), free breathing on inspiration was performed on all children during clinical stability at their most recent clinic (median age 6.5 years, range 5–10 years) and Brody score calculated by blinded radiologist (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The Brody lobular score system has been shown to be a sensitive method for evaluating the progression of CF lung disease (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). There was a median of 4.5 years between initial BAL and follow-up HRCT (range 1–7 years). All statistical analyzes were performed using GraphPad PRISM version 8. 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. To correlate protein concentration to Brody scores, a Spearman's rank order correlation analysis and Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment with a false discovery rate of
