<p>Azurocidin is an antibacterial glycoprotein released from neutrophils upon degranulation in response to tissue injury or infection. Azurocidin recruits and activates monocytes resulting in cytokine release and increased phagocytosis. Myeloperoxidase is a peroxidase enzyme that catalyzes the formation of reactive oxygen intermediates which play an important role in microbial killing. Myeloperoxidase, present in the lung fluid of CF patients, has been suggested to contribute to lung tissue destruction and the early pathogenesis of CF (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Both of these neutrophil granule proteins were correlated to more severe lung damage after age 6 suggesting early disruptions in neutrophil function and excessive neutrophil degranulation as determinants of later disease severity. Of note, IL-8 and neutrophil elastase were not correlated to Brody score in this study however this may be due to the young age of patients and the relative stability at time of bronchoscopy.
