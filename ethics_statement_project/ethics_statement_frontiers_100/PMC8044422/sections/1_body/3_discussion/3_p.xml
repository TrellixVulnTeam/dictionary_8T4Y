<p>Interleukin-22 (IL-22) is involved in mucosal host defenses including tissue repair and protection, increasing innate defenses and maintaining epithelial barrier functions. IL-22 has been shown to provide critical immunity against a number of pathogens including 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). It has been suggested that the presence of neutrophils in the lungs of CF patients results in an acquired deficiency of the IL-22 pathway due to IL-22 degradation by neutrophil proteases (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). IL-22 has also been negatively correlated with neutrophil recruitment in the lungs (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Here we observed that low levels of IL-22 in early life were correlated with more severe lung damage after age 6. Low levels of IL-22 early in life may pre-dispose certain sub-populations of CF patients to poorer immunological responses to infection, increased neutrophil recruitment and so contribute to greater lung damage later in life. Complement C3, C3a, X ray repair CCP6, and common receptor cytokine subunit gamma were all negatively correlated with Brody scores. The complement component C3 plays a central role in the activation of the complement system. Derived from C3, C3a anaphylatoxin is a potent local inflammatory mediator. Xray repair CCP6 is a DNA repair protein and the common receptor cytokine submit gamma is integral to regulating immune system functions. Low levels of these proteins may lead to dysfunctional immune responses. Nonetheless, this study has a number of limitations. The main limitation of this study is its small sample size. The widely used aptamer-based assay, SomaScan, provides relative protein quantification and further studies should include absolute quantification methods in combination. Considering these limitations results should be interpreted with caution and larger validation studies should be conducted to corroborate these exciting findings.
