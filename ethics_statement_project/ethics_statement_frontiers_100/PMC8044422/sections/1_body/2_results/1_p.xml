<p>SomaScan detected a total of 234 proteins and of these 18 were significantly correlated with Brody Scores. All proteins were detected at or above the limit of detection (LOD) of 38rfu (SomaScan white sheet). A total of 7 proteins implicated in inflammation and neutrophil function were observed to correlate with Brody scores (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Early life concentrations of azurocidin and myeloperoxidase, (two neutrophil granule proteins) were significantly higher in patients with greater lung damage after age 6 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0041 and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0182, respectively). Four immune proteins; Complement C3 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0026), X-ray repair CCP 6 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0059), C3a anaphylatoxin des Arginine (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0129) and cytokine receptor common subunit gamma (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0214) were all negatively correlated with Brody scores. Patients with more severe lung damage after age 6 had significantly lower levels of IL-22 in early years of life (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0243).
