<p>The characteristics of the six IGRA converters are summarized in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Among the six converters, four had been treated with vedolizumab, one with ustekinumab, and the other with vedolizumab followed by ustekinumab. The median interval from non-TNF inhibitor commencement to IGRA conversion was 13.5 months (range, 6.8–23.2 months). Five converters had been previously exposed to infliximab and one to both infliximab and adalimumab. Two patients (Patient 3 and Patient 6) received LTBI treatment after confirmation of IGRA conversion, but none discontinued non-TNF inhibitors. After positive IGRA conversion, none of the six converters developed active TB while maintaining non-TNF inhibitor therapy (median 6.8 months, range 0.4–32.1 months).
