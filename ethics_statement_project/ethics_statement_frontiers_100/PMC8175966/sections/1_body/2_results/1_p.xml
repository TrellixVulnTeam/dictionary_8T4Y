<p>Out of 91 patients, 55 were males (60.4%), and the median age at baseline was 36 years (interquartile range [IQR], 29–45.8 years) (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Sixty-seven patients (73.6%) had CD, and the median disease duration was 11.3 years (IQR, 8.1–17.0 years). A total of 89 patients (97.8%) had a previous history of exposure to TNF inhibitors. Vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and ustekinumab after vedolizumab failure were given to 47 (51.6%), 23 (25.3%), and 21 (23.1%) patients, respectively. The median duration of follow-up after non-TNF inhibitor commencement was 22.3 months (IQR, 15.5–31.1 months). During follow-up, six patients (6.6%) underwent positive IGRA conversion (
