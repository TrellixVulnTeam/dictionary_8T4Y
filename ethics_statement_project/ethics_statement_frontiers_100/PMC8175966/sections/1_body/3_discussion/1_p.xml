<p>In this study, six patients (6.6%) developed positive IGRA conversion in a median of 13.5 months after initiating non-TNF inhibitors; however, none of the converters developed active TB during a median follow-up of 6.8 months despite continued non-TNF inhibitor treatment. According to previous studies on LTBI and TB monitoring during TNF inhibitor therapy, fifteen out of 78 patients (19.2%) with IBD experienced positive conversion of any LTBI tests after a median follow-up of 16 months in Hong Kong (

As there was no control group treated with TNF inhibitors in our study, we could not directly compare the positive conversion rates of IGRA between patients treated with non-TNF inhibitors and those treated with TNF inhibitors. Nevertheless, by referring to the results of previous studies, we can indirectly infer that the frequency of positive IGRA conversion may be lower among patients treated with non-TNF inhibitors than those treated with TNF inhibitors. Considering that the risk of TB by TNF inhibitors is closely related to the local TB burden (
