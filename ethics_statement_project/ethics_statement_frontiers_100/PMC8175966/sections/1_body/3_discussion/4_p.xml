<p>In addition to the inherent limitations stemming from its retrospective design, our study was limited by its small sample size and a short follow-up duration after IGRA conversion. In particular, Patient 4 had the shortest follow-up duration because tofacitinib was initiated 2 weeks after IGRA conversion. However, even after Patient 4 switched to tofacitinib, active TB did not develop during 6.4 months of follow-up. Furthermore, we used IGRA alone to diagnose LTBI. Our domestic guidelines for LTBI diagnosis in immunocompromised patients recommend IGRA alone or IGRA combined with the tuberculin skin test (TST) (
