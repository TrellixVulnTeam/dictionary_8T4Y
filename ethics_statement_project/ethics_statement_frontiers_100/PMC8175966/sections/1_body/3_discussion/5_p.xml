<p>Our study was the first real-life evaluation of IGRA conversion rate among IBD patients treated with non-TNF inhibitors. Further well-designed, prospective studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to identify the impact of non-TNF inhibitors on LTBI reactivation. Consequently, evidence-based, optimized strategies for TB prevention, including testing for and treatment of LTBI among IBD patients before non-TNF inhibitor therapy, could be established.</p>
