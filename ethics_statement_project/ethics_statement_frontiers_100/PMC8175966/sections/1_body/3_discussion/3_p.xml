<p>As mentioned above, there is uncertainty whether IGRA conversions represent de novo infections or reactivation of LTBI. In our study, five out of the six converters except Patient 2 who were lost to follow-up did not have any record of recent exposure to individuals with active TB. All patients underwent evaluations to exclude TB and no patient developed active TB although LTBI therapy was given to only two patients. Meanwhile, without an available gold standard test for detecting LTBI, there is also room for uncertainty resulting from the variability of IGRA results. According to previous studies on discriminating true 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb)-specific response from test variability, 69% of borderline and 88% of low-positive IGRA results were Mtb-specific (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, except for Patient 4, all patients whose IGRA results were in the borderline zone showed a positive range of IGRA results. To overcome the inherent limitations of the test method itself, the IGRA results should be interpreted in the context of the patient's risk for TB such as epidemiologic situations. In addition, physicians should be aware of the implication of the borderline zone of IGRA value and repeat the test in cases with borderline IGRA results. The fact that we could not conduct a repeated test in Patient 4 is a limitation of our study.
