<p>The emergence of TNF (tumor necrosis factor) inhibitors has brought about significant improvements in clinical outcomes for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refractory to conventional treatment. Despite the remarkable effectiveness of TNF inhibitors, however, reactivation of latent tuberculosis (TB) is a major safety concern. The risk of TB development among IBD patients treated with TNF inhibitors has been reported to increase 1.6- to 41.7-fold, depending on regional variations in TB burden and baseline risk (
