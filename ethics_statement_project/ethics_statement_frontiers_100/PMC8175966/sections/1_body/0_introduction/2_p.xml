<p>Meanwhile, non-TNF inhibitors such as vedolizumab and ustekinumab, have shown their efficacies for inducing and maintaining clinical response and remission in patients with moderate-to-severe IBD (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Owing to their mechanisms of action, vedolizumab and ustekinumab could be regarded as safer than TNF inhibitors in terms of LTBI reactivation and active TB development. In the IM-UNITI study, only one (0.25%) out of 397 patients developed active TB (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>); likewise, a recent descriptive analysis of the 4 years post-marketing safety data based on the Vedolizumab Global Safety Database (VGSD) reported 9 (0.03%) events of TB in 208,050 patient-years of vedolizumab exposure (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Hence, it is anticipated that the risk of TB is lower among IBD patients treated with vedolizumab or ustekinumab compared with those treated with TNF inhibitors. As the development of TB among patients treated with TNF inhibitors is predominantly through LTBI reactivation (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), Lee et al. (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) investigated the LTBI test conversion rate and the subsequent risk of TB during TNF inhibitor therapy. However, data on positive LTBI test result conversion among patients treated with non-TNF inhibitors are scarce. Therefore, we now report the frequency of positive conversion of interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) results among IBD patients treated with non-TNF inhibitors, such as vedolizumab and ustekinumab, in an area with an intermediate TB burden.
