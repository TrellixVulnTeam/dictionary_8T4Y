<p>Compared to other anti-angiogenic agents, anlotinib acts on vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2/KDR, and VEGFR3), fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4), platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and stem cell factor receptor (c-kit) simultaneously (

 </xref>). As a multi-target small molecule antiangiogenic agent, it can cross the blood-brain barrier and inhibit multiple signaling pathways including PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, and RAF/MRK to inhibit both tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation (

We describe here two cases of brain edema and review the literature available and hope to discover new agents that are safer and more effective.
