<p>This paper reported for the first time that anlotinib had achieved significant curative effect in the treatment of brain edema. From the two documents, we found that anlotinib is effective in the treatment of peritumoral brain edema. However, our understanding of anlotinib in the treatment of brain edema is just the tip of the iceberg, and the effect and mechanism remain to be verified before it can be extended to clinical practice.</p>
