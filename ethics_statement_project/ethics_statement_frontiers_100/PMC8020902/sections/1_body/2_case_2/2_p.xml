<p>In January 2020, MRI of the brain revealed a single new metastatic lesion (5×5 mm) on the right side of the temporal lobe. Two months later, the new metastatic lesion (11×10×13 mm) was found to have enlarged. Subsequently, she underwent one cycle of chemotherapy (PEM 1.0 g+ CBP 400 mg). At the end of April, she complained of headache. The enlarged lesion (15×17 mm) and peritumoral brain edema on the right side of the temporal lobe were observed on MRI. At this stage, the patient received the conventional intervention of dehydration (mannitol: 250 ml bid; glucocorticoid: 3 mg qd) and local radiotherapy (Phase I: 2.0Gy/f*19f; Phase II: 3.0Gy/f*4f) was administered to the single BM. However, she experienced no noticeable relief from headaches after a week. Oral administration of anlotinib was initiated (12 mg per day, days 1–14; 21 days per cycle) and continued with steroids administration. Two weeks later, surprisingly, compared with the previous brain MRI, the BM demonstrated showed slight shrinkage (15×17 mm to 12×9 mm) while the peritumoral edema has shrunk significantly (
