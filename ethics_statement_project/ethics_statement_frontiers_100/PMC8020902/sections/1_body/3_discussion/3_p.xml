<p>In hypoxia, tumor tissues produce VEGF, PDGF (Platelet derived growth factor) and FGF (Fibroblast growth factor), which can activate angiogenesis promoting signaling pathways (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). However, when VEGF-related signaling pathways are blocked, tumor tissues can upregulate the expression of other cytokines such as FGF and PDGF, through bypass activation and other mechanisms to maintain the tumor nutritional supply. Compared to other anti-angiogenic agents, anlotinib, which targets VEGFR, PDGFR, FGFR, and c-kit can inhibit three angiogenesis promoting signaling pathways (

It has been approved by the China NMPA (National Medical Products Administration) as a third-line therapy for advanced NSCLC. Phase III ALTER 0303 and Phase II ALTER 0302 trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of anlotinib in patients with advanced NSCLC (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). A meta-analysis included 594 patients from three clinical studies (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The incidence of adverse events except fatigue was higher in the anlotinib group than in the placebo group, but heterogeneity was insignificant among the other subgroups (hypertension, thyroid-stimulating hormone elevation, anorexia, hypertriglyceridemia, diarrhea, and hemoptysis). Adverse events identified to be associated with anlotinib were tolerable.
