<p>Angiogenic edema plays a key role in the occurrence and development of intractable brain edema. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can significantly increase the vascular permeability of the tumor (

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) found that the peritumoral edema index was positively correlated with the expression of the VEGF gene and VEGF-A protein. Blocking the VEGF pathway can decrease vascular permeability and, thus, cerebral edema (

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In addition, with the introduction of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (including PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4) in clinical practice, the research of alternatives to steroids remains a critical issue. The etiology of cerebral oedema in patients treated with immunotherapy is unclear, because it may be difficult to distinguish disease progression from pseudoprogression (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). For the treatment of immune-related neurological adverse events, the use of systemic steroids may be recommended, accompanied by either a delay or cessation of checkpoint inhibitor therapy. There are few alternatives to steroids for this indication.
