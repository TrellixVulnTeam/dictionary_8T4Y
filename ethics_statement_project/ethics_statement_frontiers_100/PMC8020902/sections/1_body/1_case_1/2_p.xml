<p>In May 2020, he complained of headaches and fatigue. Investigation showed that the lesion has enlarged to 17×22 mm and peritumoral edema in the left frontal lobe was found by postaxial T1 weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Local radiotherapy with a dose of 2Gy/f*15f to the single BM was administered after nine days of dehydration treatment (mannitol: 250 ml, 6 am, 4 pm; glycerol fructose: 250 ml, 12 n, 12 mn; hexadecadrol: 3 mg, qd). However, the patient complained of recurring headaches and fatigue that showed no improvement after 12 days of conventional intervention with dehydration and 4 days of radiotherapy. He was taken treated with anlotinib (12 mg per day, days 1–14; 21 days per cycle) and continued with steroids administration. After 10 days of anlotinib treatment, his condition was assessed again. Surprisingly, the symptoms of headache and fatigue were significantly relieved. Meanwhile, compared with the previous brain MRI, the maximum vertical diameter of the BM showed slight shrunk (from 17×22 to 14×18 mm) while the peritumoral brain edema had reduced significantly (
