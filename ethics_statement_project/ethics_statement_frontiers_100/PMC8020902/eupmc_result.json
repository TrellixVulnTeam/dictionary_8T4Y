Primary and secondary brain tumors are often accompanied by peritumoral edema. Due to the limited intracranial space, peritumoral edema will further increase the intracranial pressure and aggravate clinical symptoms. Radiotherapy, as a basic component of the treatment of intracranial tumors, induces blood vessel damage and aggravates brain edema. The combination of edema caused by the tumor itself and radiotherapy is collectively referred to as intractable brain edema. Edema can increase intracranial pressure and cause associated neurologic symptoms, which seriously affects the quality of life of patients. Steroids, specifically dexamethasone, have become the gold standard for the management of tumor-associated edema.
