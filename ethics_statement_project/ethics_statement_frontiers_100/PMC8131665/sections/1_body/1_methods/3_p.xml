<p>Using 100 μl of serum, metabolites were extracted using methanol. Extracts were sonicated, and after centrifugation, the supernatant was gently added to sample vials for LC-MS/MS analysis. A pooled quality control sample (QC) was performed for system conditioning and quality control. Chromatographic separation of the metabolites was operated on a Thermo UHPLC system equipped with an ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 (100 mm × 2.1 mm i.d., 1.8 μm; Waters, Milford, USA).</p>
