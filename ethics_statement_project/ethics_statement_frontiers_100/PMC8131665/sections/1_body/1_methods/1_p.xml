<p>Experiments were performed at the Experimental Station of Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences in the Yangyuan county, Zhangjiakou city, Heibei province, northeast of China. A total of 200 crossbreed male lambs (
 <italic>Ovis aries</italic>) of Dorper rams and Mongolia ewes after weaning (45 days of age) were housed in eight sheltered outdoor paddocks and fed total mixed ration (TMR). Clean water and mineralized salt licks were available 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic>. From 75 days of age, 50 lambs with similar body weight were selected and reared in individual pens indoors (0.7 × 1.0 m) until 120 days of age. Briefly, the lambs were acclimatized, lasting 15 days before formal assessment. At 90 days, 40 lambs with similar body weight were selected to do ADG research lasting 30 days. Lamb TMR was compounded based on the recommendations of sheep feeding standard in China (NY/T816-2004) and contained digestible energy of 11.83 MJ·kg
 <sup>−1</sup>, metabolic energy of 9.73 MJ·kg
 <sup>−1</sup>, 14.61% crude protein, 0.39% calcium, and 0.25% phosphorus. Body weight of lambs was accurately measured in the morning before feeding, and at 75, 90, and 120 days of age, using calibrated electronic scales. ADG was calculated based on body weight. Differences in ADG between the high ADG and low ADG lamb group were analyzed using a 
 <italic>t</italic>-test. A 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 indicated statistical significance.
