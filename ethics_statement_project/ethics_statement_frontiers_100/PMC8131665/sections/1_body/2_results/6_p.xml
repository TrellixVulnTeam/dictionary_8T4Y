<p>Amino acids in tissue and in serum seemed to change under various physiological status, such as starvation, fasting, grazing, and stress in sheep (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and dairy cows (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). During starvation in sheep, circulating amino acids had a general trend to increase mainly because muscle proteins were mobilized to improve gluconeogenesis in the livers by enhancing amino acids supply (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Three metabolites (L-Arginine, L-Histidinol, and D-Sedoheptulose 7-phosphate) were identified to increase in circulation of low ADG lambs (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Arginine is a conditionally essential amino acid in livestock and has a potential role on regulating energy partitioning between fat and lean deposition (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Intriguingly, in lower body weight suckling lambs affected by intrauterine growth restriction, arginine supplementation increased ADG and decreased feed conversion rate (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In the growing period in Dorper and Damara sheep, seasonal weight loss resulting from dietary restriction resulted in an increased arginine level in liver, but a decreased level in Australia Merino, while histidine level increased in all three sheep studied during dietary restriction (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Plasma arginine was reported to increase in feed-restricted dairy cows, too (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Collectively, these results showed that circulating amino acid concentrations changed to satisfy requirements of growth needs and normal metabolism in sheep.
