<p>Histidine can be a substrate for gluconeogenesis and protein synthesis; however, it can also affect the active site of enzymes (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). L-Histidinol and 3-Methyl-L-histidine (annotated in histidine metabolism pathway) were down-regulated in lambs with high ADG (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), indicating that histidine metabolism had a trend of less activity, potentially to support faster growth and development in lambs in an intensive fattening system. Moreover, histidine metabolism seems to be up-regulated under nutritional restriction. It was reported that plasma L-histidine level decreased in barn confinement sheep compared with free grazing sheep due to high body weight gain (
