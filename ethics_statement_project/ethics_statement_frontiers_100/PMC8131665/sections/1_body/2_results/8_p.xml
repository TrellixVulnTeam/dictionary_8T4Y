<p>Collectively, the purpose of this report was to reveal serum metabolome profiles of fattening lambs in a barn feeding fattening system, with particular attention to unique metabolites in lambs with high or low ADG. Our findings showed that differential metabolites affected by ADG belonged to lipids and lipid-like molecules, organic nitrogen compounds, organic acids and derivatives, benzenoids, organic oxygen compounds, and organoheterocyclic compounds. The identified metabolites have an effect on regulating metabolic pathways, biosynthesis of amino acids, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and histidine metabolism. These results indicate that selected serum metabolites could have potential application to estimate sheep with different ADG. Further larger-size studies with more various cohorts of sheep are desired to validate our finding.</p>
