<p>In comparison, a total 57 differential serum metabolites were found according to the Volcano plot (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, VIP &gt; 1.0, and log
 <sub>2</sub>FC &gt; 1 or &lt; 1.0), of which 35 metabolites showed up-regulation and 22 showed down-regulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). A total of 50 differential serum metabolites were annotated in six superclasses according to the HMDB database, of which 36 belonged to lipids and lipid-like molecules, 5 belonged to organic nitrogen compounds, 4 belonged to organic acids and derivatives, 2 belonged to benzenoids, 2 belonged to organic oxygen compounds, and 1 belonged to organoheterocyclic compounds. Expression profile and VIP of the top 30 metabolites based on the OPLS-DA model are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>. Regarding the KEGG pathway, the four pathways including at least two differential serum metabolites annotated were metabolic pathways [L-Histidinol, Myristic acid, D-Sedoheptulose 7-phosphate, L-Arginine, and PC(14:1(9Z)/20:2(11Z,14Z))], biosynthesis of amino acids (L-Histidinol, D-Sedoheptulose 7-phosphate, and L-Arginine), glycerophospholipid metabolism [PC(14:1(9Z)/20:2(11Z,14Z)), LysoPC(20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)), and LysoPC(18:3(6Z,9Z,12Z))], and histidine metabolism (L-Histidinol and 3-Methyl-L-histidine), respectively. Based on our results, the serum metabolome prolife of lambs was affected by high or low ADG.
