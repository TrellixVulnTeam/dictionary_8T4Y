<p>At the beginning of the lamb fattening trial, when lambs were 90 days of age, the mean (SD in parentheses) body weight of seven original lambs corresponding to the high ADG was 26.7 (0.9) kg, while the mean body weight of seven original lambs corresponding to the low ADG was 26.8 (0.8) kg. At the end of the lamb trial, the body weight of the seven lambs with the highest weight gain was 35.67 (0.8) kg and the body weight of the seven lambs with the lower weight gain was 32.56 (1.0) kg. The ADG of high weight gain lambs was 298.1 (15.9) g·day
