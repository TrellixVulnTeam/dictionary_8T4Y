<p>Variation of ADG depends on sheep breeds and ages. Previous studies showed that crossbreed of specialized mutton breeds and local sheep breeds had greater ADG than local sheep. For local sheep breeds under a barn feeding fattening system, 6-month Altay and Hu lambs presented ADG from 100 to 200 g·day
 <sup>−1</sup> (

 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and ADG of Small Tail Han sheep lambs was between 140 and 180 g·day
 <sup>−1</sup> (

 <sup>−1</sup> in pens (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In our study, crossbreed lambs of Dorper rams and Mongolia ewes at 4-month age exhibited excellent growth performance with an average ADG of 240 g·day
 <sup>−1</sup>. Crossbreed lambs are recommended to produce lamb meat in the north part of China.
