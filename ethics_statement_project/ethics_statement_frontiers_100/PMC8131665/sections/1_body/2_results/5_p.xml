<p>As shown in

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, most of the lipids and lipid-like molecules were accumulated in serum samples of high ADG lambs compared with low ADG ones, including LysoPC(20:5 (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)) and PC(14:1(9Z)/20:2 (11Z,14Z)), which are metabolites involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism. In detail, LysoPC(20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)) and PC(14:1(9Z)/20:2(11Z,14Z)) had a high concentration in serum of high ADG lambs [log
 <sub>2</sub>(FC) = 1.04 and 1.02]. Lysophospholipids (LPL) mainly include lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), and lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI), which are derivatives of phospholipid with absence of a fatty acid chain by hydrolysis (
