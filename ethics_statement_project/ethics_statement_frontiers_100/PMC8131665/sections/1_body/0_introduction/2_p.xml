<p>Selecting those lambs expected to have high ADG, at the earliest as possible in their longevity, or at least before the fattening period, could obviously increase the profitability of sheep feedlots (

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), an indicator of feed conversion efficiency. Metabolomics can qualitatively and quantitatively analyze hundreds of metabolites in diverse samples, which can be extensively used to study physiological and pathophysiological process such as starving and intrauterine growth restriction in sheep (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Blood is considered as an ideal sample in sheep metabolomics research and is potentially used to reflect the metabolic status on a whole body level (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). As we have known, alterations in the blood metabolome profiles of sheep during the fattening period, particularly in fattening sheep with the same genetic basis, same age, same management system, but high or low ADG, are still unclear. Therefore, the aims of the present study were (i) to reveal the metabolic characteristics of lambs with high or low ADG under the same management system and (ii) to investigate the potential metabolic pathways related to the growth performance of sheep.
