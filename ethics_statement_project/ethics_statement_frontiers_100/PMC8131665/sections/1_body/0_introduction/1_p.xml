<p>Sheep industry is a major branch of animal husbandry throughout the north and central parts of China mainly for mutton and wool production (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Body weight gain during the fattening period is an important determinant for carcass weight. Sheep average daily gain (ADG) refers to the average weight gain of sheep during a certain period and is an important economic growth trait that improves production efficiency and economic benefits. Specifically, ADG has been reported to have a positive correlation coefficient (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In sheep feedlots, lambs with the same genetic basis, same age, same management system, and very similar initial body weight often develop a large standard deviation in ADG, accounting for unwanted differences in final body weights (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). To our knowledge, few studies reported the underlying metabolic mechanism of such an inter-individual difference.
