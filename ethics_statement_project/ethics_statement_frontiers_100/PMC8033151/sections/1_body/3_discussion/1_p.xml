<p>Hepatectomy is a common operation for hepatic tumors (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). ERAS strategy has been found in previous studies to significantly shorten the length of hospital stay after hepatectomy (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Also, research has shown that ERAS strategy decreased the occurrence of operative complications in patients receiving hepatectomy (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). ERAS strategy has the chance to benefit patients receiving hepatectomy (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, limited studies have assessed the ERAS strategy in patients receiving hepatectomy in China. More importantly, nearly no study has compared the clinical outcomes of patients receiving hepatectomy with or without ERAS strategy all over the world. For the first time in China, ERAS strategy was demonstrated in the current study to have the following effects on patients receiving hepatectomy: (1) reduced occurrence of operative complications, (2) shortened length of hospital stay, and (3) no increased mortality or readmission. The advantages of the ERAS strategy, such as good guidance and professional management, improved anesthetic and analgesic methods, less use of drainage tubes, and early oral intake and mobilization, could be beneficial in accelerating the function recovery and achieving better outcomes.
