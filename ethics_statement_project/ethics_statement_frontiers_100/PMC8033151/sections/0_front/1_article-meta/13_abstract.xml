  <bold>Purposes:</bold> For the first time in China, the current study was designed to compare the clinical outcomes between Chinese patients receiving hepatectomy with or without the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) strategy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Methods:</bold> The current study enrolled 250 patients who would receive hepatectomy. Patients were randomized into two groups: ERAS group (
  <italic>n</italic> = 125, ERAS strategy) and control (
  <italic>n</italic> = 125, conventional care). Mortality, length of hospital stay, readmission, and complications were assessed over 30 days after the operation.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Results:</bold> The average age of the whole cohort was 65 (63–68) years, with 152 males (60.8%). There was no difference between two groups in baseline features, such as age, sex, medical history, Child–Pugh hepatic function, American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status, operative type, hepatectomy type, and hepatic pathology (
  <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05 for all). There was no occurrence of death in the two groups. Patients in the ERAS group had significantly less occurrence of post-operative complications and a shorter length of hospital stay (
  <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 for all). Deep vein thrombosis occurred in seven patients in the control group, but did not occur in the ERAS group (
  <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Patients in the two groups had similar occurrence of readmission (
  <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05).
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Conclusions:</bold> ERAS strategy significantly decreased the occurrence of operative complications and shortened the length of hospital stay without any increase in mortality or readmission in Chinese patients receiving hepatectomy.
