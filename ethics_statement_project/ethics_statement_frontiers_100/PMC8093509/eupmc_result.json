As one of Canada's largest CAP subspecialty programs, we attract many excellent applicants annually. While objectivity and transparency in the selection of candidates have been valued, it was unclear which applicant attributes should be prioritized.

Through iterative design, this list was categorized into \"end products,\" \"branding attributes\" and \"generic attributes.\" The \"end products\" were removed as these represented outputs of training rather than attributes on which applicant selection should be based. Subsequent steps involved only the \"branding\" and \"generic\" attributes. A consensus-building exercise led to the creation of two short-lists of five attributes within each category.
