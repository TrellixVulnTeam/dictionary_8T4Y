<p>We report the results of the forced choice pairwise comparison for both the generic attributes (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) and the branding attributes (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Of the generic attributes, integrity/ethics/morality (Attribute A in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) was chosen the most frequently in each pairing. Similarly, clinical strength/expertise (Attribute I in 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) was the most frequently chosen in each pairing of the branding attributes. The forced choice pairwise comparison results were used to develop the final rank ordering for each list of attributes, which are presented in 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>.
