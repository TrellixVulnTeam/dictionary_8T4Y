<p>The second phase of this project involved ranking in order of importance, via forced choice pairwise comparison (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), the attributes developed in Phase 1. For each of the attribute categories, respondents were randomly presented with each attribute pairing and were forced to choose one attribute from each pairing. The final rank order list of attributes was developed based on the number of times each attribute was chosen through all of the pairings. This pairwise comparison was completed electronically by members of the DCYMH following the 2017 retreat. As a means of increasing participation, project team members (CAK &amp; MDH) visited eight of eleven Divisional teaching sites (hospitals and community mental health centres) to discuss the project at local medical staff meetings. These site visits provided further opportunity to discuss the overall goals of the project and to answer questions. Participants in the meeting were shown how to access the pairwise comparison survey and were encouraged to complete it following the meeting. A similar meeting was held with trainees enrolled in the UT CAP subspecialty training program. The pairwise comparison survey was also distributed electronically to members of the DCYMH so that it could be completed by anyone who was not in attendance at the informational sessions.
