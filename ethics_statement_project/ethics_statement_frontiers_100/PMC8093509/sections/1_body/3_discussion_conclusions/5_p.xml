<p>Although, this project allowed for a great deal of collaboration and consensus building within the DCYMH, including physician and non-physician members, one potential limitation is that it did not involve individuals from outside the Division. It would have been valuable to include voices from within the broader Department of Psychiatry or the Faculty of Medicine. Incorporating viewpoints of persons with lived experience in defining the attributes that they would expect in future child and adolescent psychiatrists is also important. In future iterations of this project, it would add value to expand the collaborative process to include key stakeholders, such as family advocates and persons with lived experience, to further enhance the applicability of this work.</p>
