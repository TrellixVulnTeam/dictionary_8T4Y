<p>The collaborative consensus building approach that we undertook to develop our priority attributes can be applied and modified as needed at other institutions. As the project was conducted with minimal budget and resources, many other institutions should be able to replicate it. As the program's brand continues to develop, this work should be considered the first part of an iterative process that is repeated over time as priorities evolve. Future directions include operationalizing the attributes as they are applied to the admissions process, as well as measuring the reliability of assessing them. Input from residents and eventually from graduates will be valuable in understanding the influence of the attributes on how applicants view our program and the experience of residents trained in it.</p>
