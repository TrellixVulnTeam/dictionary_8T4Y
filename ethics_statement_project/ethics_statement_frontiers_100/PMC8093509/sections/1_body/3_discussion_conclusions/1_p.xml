<p>We used an interactive consensus building approach to develop a list of key applicant attributes, and then a pair-wise comparison approach to rank these attributes for use in resident selection. This project has shown that such an approach is feasible, thus allowing for collaborative co-construction of priority attributes. These priority attributes can now be used to transparently describe desired applicant profiles, thus achieving the primary goals of this project. Information about attributes being sought can be listed in recruitment materials, including the program webpage, and incorporated into the admissions process. Some attributes may be best suited for assessment via file review, some through interview, and some through both processes. Assessment of attributes will need to be operationalized so they can be assessed when reviewing files and/or through interviews (e.g., each interview focusing on a subset of the attributes). Although, the attributes may be perceived as subjective, the interview allows for focus on applicant experiences that reflect these attributes in the delivery of mental health care for children, youth, and their families. By developing transparent criteria that can be used across the selection process, we can mitigate potential sources of bias (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), an additional goal of this project. Previously different file reviewers/interviewers may have implicitly prioritized different attributes, leading to variability between assessors and across years. With transparent lists of priority attributes constituting preferred applicant profiles, admissions assessments are based explicitly on commonly valued and defined criteria (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), rather than the unperceived values and biases of individual assessors.
