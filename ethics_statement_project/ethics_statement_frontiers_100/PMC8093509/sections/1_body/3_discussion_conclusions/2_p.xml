<p>The final goal of this project was to distinctly position as a brand the UT CAP training within the competitive national CAP training landscape. Rather than a top-down approach dictated by a few individuals, the involvement of members of the entire Division in developing these attributes was a critical aspect in gathering input that accounts for the organizational culture and wishes of its members (

By explicitly defining the attributes being sought in incoming UT CAP residents, we are paving the way toward the development of an explicit brand that differentiates the UT CAP program from other CAP programs across the county. We acknowledge that other programs may seek overlapping qualities in their applicants; however, we are the first CAP program in Canada to explicitly identify and recruit for specific attributes. In doing so, the program stands out as one that is interested in recruiting from the national candidate pool and not solely from the local pool of potential candidates. From the applicant perspective, future applicants can be clear about the priorities of the program, thus allowing them to make informed decisions about applying to and accepting a position in the program. Given the high number of applicants for limited positions, this opportunity to ensure fit is particularly important.
