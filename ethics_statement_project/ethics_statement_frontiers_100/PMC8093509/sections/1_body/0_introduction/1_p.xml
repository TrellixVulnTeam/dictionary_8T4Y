<p>Canadian child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) subspecialty training constitutes a 2-year program with entry during the final year of a 5-year general psychiatry training program, for a total of 6 years of training following graduation from medical school. In 2012, the CAP subspecialty program at the University of Toronto (UT) was among the first to become a Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) accredited training program. A total of 16 CAP programs have since been established and accredited across the country. There is a non-centralized application process, although, programs collaborate to determine shared timelines for application deadlines, interviews and offers. Each program admits one to seven applicants per year. The UT CAP program has been competitive, attracting as many as 15 applicants for 3â€“5 positions in the program. All applicants are typically highly accomplished and motivated residents. However, their career trajectories are often quite varied and residents enter the program with an array of strengths and interests. In the early days of the program, residents were selected based on a review of their application file (consisting of their CV, reference letters, and a personal statement) and two in-person semi-structured interviews. Although, there were 10 selection criteria, none of these was explicitly prioritized over the others, and thus they were subject to individual interpretation and implicit bias by file reviewers and interviewers. Moreover, these 10 criteria were identified by the selection committee without broader input from other stakeholders.</p>
