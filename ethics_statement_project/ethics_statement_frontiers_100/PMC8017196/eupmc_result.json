Some cases show familial inheritance. <b>Case report:</b> A female patient (from a gravida 1, para 1 mother) of 3.5 years of age was admitted to the Pediatric Hematology Department of Xianyang Caihong Hospital in June 2019. The patient had severe anemia, acupoint-size bleeding spots, and a few ecchymoses all over her body, as well as astigmatism and hyperopia. Hearing was normal. The patient had diabetes. Bone marrow biopsy suggested a myelodysplastic syndrome. The patient had a c.515G>A (p.G172D) homozygous mutation of <i>SLC19A2</i> (NM_006996), indicating TRMA. Genetic testing revealed that the two alleles were inherited from her mother alone due to maternal uniparental isodisomy (UPD). The patient was treated with thiamine and a subcutaneous injection of insulin. The patient recovered well and was discharged. She continued thiamine and insulin at the same dose and was followed once a month. The last follow-up on September 15, 2020, showed no anemia or bleeding.
