<p>Thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome (TRMA), first reported by Porter et al. in 1969 (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary disease with an extremely low incidence. Only about 80 cases have been reported worldwide so far (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). TRMA is characterized by megaloblastic anemia, diabetes, and sensorineural deafness and is also associated with congenital heart disease, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, retinal detachment, optic atrophy, and stroke. The average time to diagnosis is up to 8 years (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The early diagnosis of TRMA is based on family history, apoptosis in fibroblast during culture without thiamine, and thiamine therapy's effectiveness (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). TRMA is induced by mutations in 
 <italic>SLC19A2</italic> (NM_006996.2) that encodes the high-affinity thiamine transporter-1 (THTR-1) (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). So far, &gt;60 mutation reports have been reported (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In this report, the genetic and clinical features of the first TRMA patient worldwide with the c.515G&gt;A (p.G172D) 
 <italic>SLC19A2</italic> homozygous mutation inherited through maternal uniparental isodisomy (UPD) are reported.
