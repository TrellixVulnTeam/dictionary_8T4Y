  <bold>Background:</bold> Thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome (TRMA) is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary disease due to mutations in 
  <italic>SLC19A2</italic>. Some cases show familial inheritance.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Case report:</bold> A female patient (from a gravida 1, para 1 mother) of 3.5 years of age was admitted to the Pediatric Hematology Department of Xianyang Caihong Hospital in June 2019. The patient had severe anemia, acupoint-size bleeding spots, and a few ecchymoses all over her body, as well as astigmatism and hyperopia. Hearing was normal. The patient had diabetes. Bone marrow biopsy suggested a myelodysplastic syndrome. The patient had a c.515G&gt;A (p.G172D) homozygous mutation of 
  <italic>SLC19A2</italic> (NM_006996), indicating TRMA. Genetic testing revealed that the two alleles were inherited from her mother alone due to maternal uniparental isodisomy (UPD). The patient was treated with thiamine and a subcutaneous injection of insulin. The patient recovered well and was discharged. She continued thiamine and insulin at the same dose and was followed once a month. The last follow-up on September 15, 2020, showed no anemia or bleeding. She had a sound hearing and normal blood routine and fasting glucose levels. Hyperopia and astigmatism did not improve.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Conclusion:</bold> The patient had TRMA induced by the c.515G&gt;A (p.G172D) homozygous mutation of 
  <italic>SLC19A2</italic> inherited through maternal UPD. The genetic diagnosis of TRMA is of significance for guiding clinical treatment. Early treatment with exogenous thiamine can improve some of the clinical features of TRMA.
