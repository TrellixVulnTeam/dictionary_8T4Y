<p>Given the hostile nature of his irradiated, previously dissected and fibrotic neck tissue, an IMAP flap was preferred rather than free tissue transfer for reconstruction.

The flap was extended to the midaxillary line, raised in a suprafascial plane, with paddle dimensions of superior width 6 cm, inferior width 5 cm, and a length of 4 cm and tubed on the chest. After de-epithelialization and islanding, the flap was tunneled across a short skin bridge, inset into the defect over a nasogastric tube and the external defect was closed (
