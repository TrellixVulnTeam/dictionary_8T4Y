<p>The senior author has previously reported on the utility of the IMAP flap in reconstructing small to medium sized pharyngeal defects resulting from stricture release (

This report demonstrates how this versatile, simple, and reliable flap can be used even for circumferential pharyngeal defects, with primary tension free closure of the donor site. Free tissue transfer is still our first-choice option for pharyngo-esophageal reconstruction, but following stricture release in a hostile, irradiated, and recipient vessel depleted neck, the IMAP flap is an excellent alternative option for reconstruction to be aware of, avoiding the known complications with irradiated vessels in head and neck reconstruction (
