<p>Stricture at the cutaneous-mucosal anastomotic junction between the pharynx and tubed skin flaps can be a difficult problem to manage following pharyngo-esophageal reconstruction (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). This reconstructive dilemma is further complicated in the setting of previous radiation and neck dissection, often leaving hostile surgical conditions and vessel deplete necks. Shayan et al. previously described the pedicled internal mammary artery perforator (IMAP) fasciocutaneous flap as a useful technique for reconstructing small-medium partial defects following annular pharyngeal stricture release (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). We describe a case of a circumferential pharyngo-esophageal defect following releasing of a pharyngeal stricture, in a patient who had previously had an antero-lateral thigh (ALT) reconstruction, bilateral neck dissections, and radiotherapy. This is the first case reporting the successful use of the tubed pedicled IMAP flap to reconstruct a circumferential defect.
