<p>The IMAP flap was first described by Yu et al. as a thin, pliable fasciocutaneous perforator flap based on the deltopectoral (DP) axis, for reconstructing tracheostomal and anterior neck defects (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Unlike the DP flap which requires a wide based flap to ensure the capture of numerous perforators which subsequently restricts flap mobility, the IMAP flap can be islanded on a single perforator. This allows a wider arc of rotation and flap versatility, with the ability to achieve primary closure of the donor site and a single stage reconstruction. Meticulous dissection is required to free any adherent fascial bands around the IMA/V perforator, minimizing the risk of kinking as well as facilitating tension free mobilization of the islanded flap. Numerous anatomical studies have since improved the understanding of the utility and limitations of the IMAP flap (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The flap can be raised on any of the first four IMA perforators (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), however the second has been shown to have the largest diameter perforator (1.6 ± 0.5 mm, range: 0.9–2.3 mm) and perfuse the largest skin dimensions (16 x 9 cm). The flap in this case was successfully raised on the left 2nd intercostal perforator. Although not required in this case, techniques can be employed to gain additional reach of the flap, such as removal of adjacent costal cartilages and distal ligation of the IMA with retrograde dissection (
