<p>One of the main advantages of the IMAP flap is that in most patients, it is thin and pliable and therefore is less likely to obstruct around the stoma. Although the presented case demonstrates subfascial flap raising in a thin patient, studies have demonstrated the blood supply of the IMAP being mainly subdermal in nature and therefore suprafascial flaps have been reported for cases whereby the chest wall tissue is more bulky (

In bulkier flaps, it may be possible to offset the tubularised skin paddle at 45Â°, to reduce the risk of the proximal portion of the flap obstructing the stoma. For buried flaps, like in our case, if direct closure isn't achievable, the skin from the de-epithelialized portion of the flap can be used as a graft. Consideration for the use in women or high BMI patients should be taken carefully, as not only is the flap potentially bulkier given the location, but closure of the donor site can significantly alter breast aesthetics.
