<p>Pre-operative imaging with CTA has been recommended to identify individual perforator location (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In the reported case, the CTA demonstrated bilateral intact IMA's, with only a large venous perforator in the right 2nd ICS, along with smaller arterial perforators in the right 1st and 3rd ICS. Intraoperative exploration demonstrated only small right sided arterial perforators in the 1st and 3rd ICS, insufficient for the required flap dimensions. Dissection proceeded to the left side, which demonstrated adequate caliber IMA/V perforator in the left second intercostal space in spite of the CTA findings. The most likely reason behind the discrepancy between the CT and clinical findings being that the imaging was performed in the venous phase. Although imaging is not essential, we would still advise either CTA or color duplex ultrasound, if available, which has been shown to ascertain perforator size and flow as part of the pre-operative planning (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).
