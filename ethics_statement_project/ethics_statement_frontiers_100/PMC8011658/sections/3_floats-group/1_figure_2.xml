   <bold>(A)</bold> The medial extension of the flap is de-epithelialized and the lateral portion is tubed with the epithelial surface forming the internal tube lining. This is diagrammatically represented with the measurements of the flap design used in this case in 
   <bold>(B)</bold>. 
   <bold>(C,D)</bold> The flap was then rotated superiorly and a wide subcutaneous tunnel created, insetting the tubed IMAP proximally to the pharynx (previous tubed ALT flap) and distally to the esophagus.
