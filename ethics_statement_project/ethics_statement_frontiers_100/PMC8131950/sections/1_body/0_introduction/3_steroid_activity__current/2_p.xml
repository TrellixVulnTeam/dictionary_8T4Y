<p>Sex steroids (estrogen and androgen) biosyntheses belong in two pathways. The intra-gonadal endocrine production and the peripheric intracrine production. The endocrine pathway is carried by the ovaries and testes. Active sex steroids are synthesized from cholesterol and released in circulation to have their effects on target tissues. The intracrine pathway depends on intracellular activation of adrenal derived precursors (also named sex steroid precursors, SSP), namely DHEA and androstenedione. These circulating precursors, when presented to tissues with the required enzymes, are converted into active androgens capable of having a direct effect on the cell in the presence of AR (

The brain, endometrium, and prostate all have the ability of controlling the occupancy of the AR by conversion of SSPs into active or inactive products. The main enzymes required in androgen metabolism are 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17βHSD) types 5 and 2 which catalyze androgens activation and inactivation, respectively (
