<p>During lung development, many regulatory factors exert a negative or positive pressure on the communication between fibroblasts and PTII cells that lead to surfactant production (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Glucocorticoids have been known to stimulate the production of surfactant-associated protein and stimulate cell maturation through their actions on glucocorticoid receptors in the fetal lung (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> exposure of fibroblasts to androgens decreases their ability to stimulate the maturation of PTII cells (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). As with glucocorticoids, the effect of androgens on the developing lung is mediated by specific androgen receptors (AR) activation (
