<p>RDS can be an early phase of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), another lung complication of premature birth. BPD was originally described as a heterogeneous group of lung disorders associated with preterm birth and lung impairment due to mechanical ventilation (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). It is a consequence of extreme premature birth with immature lungs rather than a consequence of extended RDS treatment with mechanical ventilation as it was previously described. Its incidence is also higher in males than females (
