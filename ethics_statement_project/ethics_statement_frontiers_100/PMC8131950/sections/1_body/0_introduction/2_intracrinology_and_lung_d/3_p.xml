<p>Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) is the leading cause of mortality in preterm neonates (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). RDS is the consequence of birth before the emergence of mature lung epithelial type II (PTII) cells that are responsible for surfactant synthesis. The syndrome is characterized by the collapse of airway membranes due to a lack of surfactant. The degree of severity increases with the degree of prematurity (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), morbidity (extremely-low-birth-weight infant) and sex. Indeed, more than four decades ago, Farrell and Avery (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) reported a higher incidence of RDS in male vs. female. This sexual dimorphism has been considered to be caused by the presence of androgens in the male lung that cause a delay in the PTII cell maturation and thus a delay in the surge of surfactant lipid production. For review see (
