<p>Mammalian lung development divides into 5 overlapping stages. When the embryonic, pseudo-glandular and canalicular stages end, the formation of terminal bronchioles with terminal sacs begins. The saccular stage results in primitive alveoli. Finally, in the alveolar stage, secondary septa grow into the airspace to increase the surface area of the lung and allow efficient gas exchange through a thin vascularized diffusion membrane (
