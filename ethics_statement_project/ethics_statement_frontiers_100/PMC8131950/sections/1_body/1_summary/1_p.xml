<p>In resume, intracrinology refers to 
 <italic>in situ</italic> synthesis of active steroids in the cell where the steroids have their action (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Four criteria are necessary to extend intracrinology to the developing lung in context of BPD. First, there must be circulating SSPs in the fetal circulation. Second, the lung cell must be able to transform these into androgens 
 <italic>in situ</italic>. Third, these lung cells must be androgen receptors positive to allow an androgen dependent reaction. Lastly, the androgen action must be part of the lung physiology.
