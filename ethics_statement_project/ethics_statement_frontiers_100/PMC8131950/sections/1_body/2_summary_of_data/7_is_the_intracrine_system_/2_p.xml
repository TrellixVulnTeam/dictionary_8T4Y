<p>With this algorithm, we were able to confirm an experimental model of BPD with hyperoxia. Indeed, newborn mice from postnatal (PN) 1 to PN 4 were exposed to 80% oxygen (hyperoxia) and compared with newborn exposed to 21% oxygen (normoxia). The mice exposed to hyperoxia presented drastic changes in density of closed area, a diminution of the relative frequency of closed area under 1,000 mm (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) (alveoli and saccules) and an augmentation of closed area over 1,000 mm (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) compared to mice in normoxia (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). These changes correspond to an alveolar simplification which is the major characteristic of BPD (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).
