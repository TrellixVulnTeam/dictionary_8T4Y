<p>If removing androgen response is deleterious to the lung, adding them should reverse this effect. Surprisingly, mice exposed to 80% oxygen then treated with exogenous DHT, had similar morphogenic parameters as mice treated with flutamide alone (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). At 21% oxygen the mice treated with DHT still showed alveolar simplification compared to the control mouse. This result indicates that the complex enzymatic mechanism of androgen activation and inactivation in the lung is active and cannot be bypassed by exogenous androgens in order to exert a physiological action on lung development.
