<p>To make progress, we needed a faster, more precise and reliable morphogenic analysis method. To do so, we developed an automated image analysis program to study the lung development with higher reproducibility, reliability and rapidity than manual analysis. Moreover, a greater portion of the lung and a larger number of samples can be evaluated with this novel method (
