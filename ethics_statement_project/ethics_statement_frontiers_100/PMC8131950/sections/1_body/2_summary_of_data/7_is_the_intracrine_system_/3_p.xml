<p>To evaluate the contribution of androgens during lung maturation, we treated neonate pups with flutamide during the junction between the saccular and the alveolar stage. Flutamide is a pure antiandrogen that binds to the AR but prevents androgens to have an AR mediated response in the cell (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Both normoxia and hyperoxia flutamide-treated mice showed alveolar impairment. Indeed, at 21% oxygen the relative frequency of closed areas under 1,000 μm (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) decreased and the ones over 2,500 μm (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) increased. The mice exposed to hyperoxia showed the most dramatic alveolar simplification (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). The absence of androgen action does not restore the structure of the lung, this supports a positive role for androgens in lung. As we are in a period of fetal development where the levels of circulating androgen are very low in both sexes but specially in male (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), the androgens in the fetal lung must be formed from SSPs.
