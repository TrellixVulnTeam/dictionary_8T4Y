<p>17β-HSD type 2 is expressed in mice (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) and human fetal (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) lungs epithelial cells and in mesenchymal cells to a lesser extent. This suggests that the androgen inactivation capability is widely distributed in the lung. Around mid-gestation, in mice (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) and humans (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), all epithelial cells from the distal epithelium, most of the proximal epithelium and most mesenchymal cells express the 17β-HSD type 2 genes. Moreover, the expression of 17β-HSD type 2 gene is more intense in the budding portion of developing respiratory ducts as well as in the proximal epithelial cells in early saccular stage. The expression of 17β-HSD type 2 gene also shows a marked decrease between the saccular and alveolar stage (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), but is upregulated from GD 16.5 to 17.5 (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).
