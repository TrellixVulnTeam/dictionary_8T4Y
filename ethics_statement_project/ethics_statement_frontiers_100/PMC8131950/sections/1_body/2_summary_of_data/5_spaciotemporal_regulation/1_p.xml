<p>17β-HSD type 5 is expressed in PTII-like cell line A-549 (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) in the mouse (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) as well as in fetal human lungs (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). A peak of expression of the enzyme is detected on GD 17.5 in the fetal lung of both male and female mice. This peak corresponds to the surge of surfactant in mature PTII cells (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Analyses of human lungs from 17 to 40 weeks of pregnancy reveled a similar increase in mid-late gestation (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). These results strongly suggest that both male and female fetal lung can synthesize androgens. In human fetal lungs, 17β-HSD type 5 is located in a small population of epithelial cells in proximal airways and rarely in the distal epithelium where PTII cells are still in development. It is absent from the mesenchyme, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). These results suggest that 17β-HSD type 5 positive cells are specific to the conducting zone (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).
