<p>The first condition necessary to have an intracrine function is the presence of circulating sex specific steroid precursors (SSPs). The rodent model was considered in the first place to make direct measurements. It is important to note that androstenedione is the main SSPs in rodents whereas in humans DHEA and androstenedione are the main precursors (

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) measured high levels of DHEAS in the umbilical cord and not in the cubital vein of pregnant women. This result strongly suggests that the human placenta is indeed capable of producing sex specific steroid precursors with a peak late in pregnancy. Sex-specific steroid precursors are present in the fetal circulation and they are most likely from a placental origin rather than from the maternal adrenal.
