<p>The AR is expressed at similar levels in male and female mouse with no detectable modulation over time (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In human, AR is expressed in fetal lungs as soon as 13–16 weeks of pregnancy, mainly in epithelial cells (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) and fibroblasts (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) to a lesser extent. It is detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus of the conducting and respiratory zone cells (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). AR mRNA levels increases between the saccular and alveolar stage of lung development as opposed to 17β-HSD type 2 which decreases (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). These results suggest that the androgen sensibility in the lung begin before the alveolar stage. AR is detected in 17β-HSD type 5 positive and negative cells such as fibroblasts.
