<p>We also aimed to describe the enzymatic activity regarding androgen metabolism in perinatal pulmonary fibroblasts using eight normal diploïd cells. Regarding androgen synthesis, none of them showed the capacity to form androgens from SSPs but the opposite reaction was observed. Indeed, the human lung fibroblast cells show a pattern of androgen inactivation where testosterone is mainly converted back into androstenedione and androstanedione without any formation of 5α-DHT. The enzymes responsible for androgen metabolism in lung fibroblasts are 17β-HSD type 2 and 5α-reductase type 1, the latter having a strong substrate preference for androstenedione, the product of 17β-HSD type 2. In addition, all lung fibroblasts studied have the ability to inactivate androgens into their 17-ketosteroid counterparts regardless of sex (
