<p>17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17β-HSDs) (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and 5α-reductases (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) are the enzymes involved in the synthesis of active androgens from circulating sex-specific steroid precursors (SSPs) in peripheric human tissues. Studies from Milewich et al. (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) confirmed the presence of 3αHSD's and 17βHSD's activities by the capability of the human lung to metabolized SSPs. Following these studies within the developing lung, we aimed to characterize the enzymatic machinery and identify the cells carrying these activities.
