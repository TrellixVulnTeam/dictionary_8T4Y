<p>We first described the ability of pulmonary epithelial type 2 (PTII) cells to synthesize androgens from SSPs 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> using A549 cells. This PTII like cell line was established from a lung adenocarcinoma of an adult male. They have been widely used to study androgen metabolism (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). As normal PTII cells, A549 cells can synthesize and secrete surfactant (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and are androgen receptors (AR) positive (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Our results show that A549 cells can rapidly convert androstenedione into testosterone with a little formation of 5α-DHT and the inactive 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). These cells show high levels of expression of 17β-HSD type 5 and 3α-HSD type 3. Overall, A549 cells present a high 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> capacity of synthesizing and maintaining testosterone levels from SSPs while rapidly inactivating DHT (
