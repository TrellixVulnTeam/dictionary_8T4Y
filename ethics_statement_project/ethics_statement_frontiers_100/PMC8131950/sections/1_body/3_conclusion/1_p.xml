<p>In 2004, we proposed that androgens should play a positive role in lung development for both sexes (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Since then, we have accumulated several observations leading to the conclusion that intracrinology concept applies to the developing lung. In order to better understand the action of steroids in the developing lung and demystify the dimorphism associated with the prevalence of BPD in males, a gender-sex-based analysis approach, which takes into account sex, was chosen. This approach has allowed a new understanding of the role of androgens in lung development and has allowed us to demonstrate that the lung is a SEX organ with an INTRACRINE function with therapeutic potential for BPD.
