<p>During development, the lungs and particularly the female lungs are not exposed to a significant amount of circulating androgens (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Nevertheless, the androgen receptor has been found in the nucleus of several cells in developing lungs in both sexes (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Moreover, the fetal lung in both sexes is capable of synthesizing testosterone from sex-specific circulating precursors (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) through 17β-HSD type 5 expressed in PTII cells (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). On the other hand, fibroblasts expressing 17β-HSD type 2 (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) inactivates androgens (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Finally, removing all androgen response in the cells with flutamide causes alveolar simplification (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), and the alveolar impairment cannot be reversed with the administration of exogenous DHT, because the specific enzymatic machinery has been bypassed.
