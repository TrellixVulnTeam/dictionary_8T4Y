  <bold>Background:</bold> Chronic cough is a common complaint that in rare cases can be caused by premature ventricular beats (PVCs).
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> In this report, we present the case of a healthy 44-year-old female who presented persistent cough and cough syncope that was attributed to PVCs.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Results:</bold> The cough disappeared after radiofrequency ablation, and no recurrence of arrhythmia or cough was observed.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Conclusion:</bold> PVCs should be considered a probable cause of chronic cough and cough syncope in differential diagnosis.
