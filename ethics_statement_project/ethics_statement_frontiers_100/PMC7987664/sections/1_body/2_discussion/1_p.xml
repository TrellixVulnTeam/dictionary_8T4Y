<p>We report the case of a 44-year-old female who presented to our hospital for PVCs with chronic cough and cough syncope. Symptoms were resolved immediately with the suppression of the PVCs, supporting the causal relationship. The mechanism is uncertain. It has been proposed that PVC-induced cough happens due to the cardiopulmonary reflex (

Sebastian and his colleagues reported that a patient had premature ventricular complex-induced chronic cough and cough syncope and speculated that the cough reflex was triggered by stimulating sympathetic innervation in the right ventricular outflow tract or pulmonary artery (

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Another mechanism is the cough reflex, which either directly activates C-fibers in the left ventricular wall or distends the pulmonary artery and activates cough receptors as a result of augmented pulmonary blood flow following PVCs (
