<p>Our patient's case demonstrated PVC-induced cough and cough syncope in a single healthy patient. We suspect that the PVCs might be responsible for coughing in our patient. Even though cough is a rare symptom, it is necessary to explain potential mechanisms between cough and PVC or other arrhythmias. PVCs should be considered a probable cause of chronic cough in the clinical setting.</p>
