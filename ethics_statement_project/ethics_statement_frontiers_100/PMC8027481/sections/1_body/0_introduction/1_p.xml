<p>Among the various forms of breast tumors, phyllodes tumor (PT) has the lower incidence rate (1/100,000 individuals) (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Moreover, the total risk of malignancy is approximately 2.1/1 million individuals (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). According to WHO data, this type includes malignant, borderline and benign tumors (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This is mostly unilateral disease (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), and the probability of axillary lymph node metastasis is extremely low (

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Hypoglycemia is a common endocrine emergency, usually associated with diabetes and endocrine disorders (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Certain tumors may lead to hypoglycemia which are known as tumor-associated hypoglycemia. Tumor-associated hypoglycemia can be classified into two categories according to the mechanism underlying its development. The most common mechanism is high secretion of insulin by insulinomas. The second mechanism, termed non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia (NICTH), involves the formation of a certain high molecular weight form of insulin like growth factor 2 (IGF-2), which abnormally binds to insulin receptors in the tissues, leads to increased glucose utilization, and causes hypoglycemia (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). NITCH was first reported on primary hepatocellular carcinoma in 1929 (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Clinically, breast PTs with NITCH are rare and first reported in 1983 (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). We investigated and detected a type of NICTH initiation method, which is mainly caused by giant borderline PT. Preoperative hypoglycemia may be affected by IGF-2 produced by PTs.
