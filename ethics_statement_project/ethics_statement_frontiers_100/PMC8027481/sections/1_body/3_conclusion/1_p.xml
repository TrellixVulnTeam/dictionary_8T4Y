<p>This report presents a case of NITCH caused by a giant borderline PT of the breast. However, it was a pity that we were unable to measure the serum IGF-2 and IGF-1 levels before and after surgery. After excluding the possibility of islet cell tumor by theÂ preoperative examination. And then combining with relevant literature and perioperative blood glucose changes and the postoperative immunohistochemical staining, we inferred that the hypoglycemia symptoms were most likely caused by the high expression of IGF-2 in the phyllodes tumor. The disease and related clinical manifestations are extremely rare in clinical practice. To avoid missed diagnosis, it is necessary for clinicians to consider that PTs with hypoglycemia may be caused by NICTH, monitor the blood glucose levels during the perioperative period, and select the most appropriate treatment to avoid delays in diagnosis and treatment. This article can provide useful guidelines for clinical practice.</p>
