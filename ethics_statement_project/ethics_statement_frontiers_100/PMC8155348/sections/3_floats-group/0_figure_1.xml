  <p>Detection of plasma levels of 25(OH)D and its correlation with PaO2/FiO2 ratio in COVID‐19 patients. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Analysis of plasma levels of 25(OH)D detected into female and male patients (left panel) and among the 4 subgroups of patients: A, 40 pre-menopausal females under 45 years; B, 40 males under 45 years; C, 40 post-menopausal females over 55 years; D, 40 males over 55 years. Data referred to plasma levels of 25(OH)D are reported as mean ± SD. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Correlation and linear regression analysis of plasma levels of 25(OH)D and PaO2/FiO2 ratio in female and male patients categorized into four groups: A, 40 pre-menopausal females under 45 years (A: &lt; 45 yrs); B, 40 males under 45 years (B: &lt; 45 yrs); C, 40 post-menopausal females over 55 years (C: &gt; 55 yrs); D, 40 males over 55 years (D: &gt; 55 yrs). A significantly positive correlation between plasma levels of 25(OH)D and PaO2/FiO2 ratio is observed in subgroups A and B. The Spearman's rho (R) and 
   <italic>P</italic> values were determined using the Spearman's rank correlation analysis. Solid lines represent best fits as estimated by linear regression analysis. *, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
