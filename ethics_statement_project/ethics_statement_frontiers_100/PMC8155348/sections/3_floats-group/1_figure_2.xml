  <p>Correlation of plasma 25(OH) vitamin D levels with 17β-estradiol and Testosterone in COVID-19 patients. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Correlation and linear regression analysis of plasma levels of 25(OH)D and 17β-estradiol in female and male patients categorized into four groups: A, 40 pre-menopausal females under 45 years (A: &lt; 45 yrs); B, 40 males under 45 years (B: &lt; 45 yrs); C, 40 post-menopausal females over 55 years (C: &gt; 55 yrs); D, 40 males over 55 years (D: &gt; 55 yrs). A significantly positive correlation between plasma levels of 25(OH)D and 17β-estradiol is observed in subgroup C. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Correlation and linear regression analysis of plasma levels of 25(OH)D and testosterone into four groups. A significantly positive correlation between plasma levels of 25(OH)D and testosterone levels is observed in males and in subgroup D. The Spearman's rho (R) and 
   <italic>P</italic> values were determined using the Spearman's rank correlation analysis. Solid lines represent best fits as estimated by linear by linear regression analysis. *, 
   <italic>P </italic>&lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
