<p>No significant differences in plasma levels of 25(OH)D were detected between female and male patients and among the four subgroups of patients divided according to sex and age (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, the 25(OH)D plasma levels positively correlated to PaO2/FiO2 ratio only in young patients (subgroups A and B, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0,03 and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0,01 respectively, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), regardless of the sex of patients. The here observed age-dependent vitamin D association with respiratory functionality in COVID-19 patients suggested the involvement of sex hormones in vitamin D effects. Hence, we correlated 25(OH)D levels with sex hormones plasma levels and we observed a significantly positive correlation between 17Î²-estradiol and 25(OH)D in elderly women (subgroup C, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) and between testosterone and 25(OH)D in elderly men (subgroup D, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.04, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), supporting the role of sex hormones in maintaining 25(OH)D levels.
