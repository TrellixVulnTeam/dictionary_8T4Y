      "The incidence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) continue to increase worldwide. Therefore, new preventive strategies are needed to lower the burden of this disease. Previous studies reported that aspirin could suppress the development of sporadic colorectal adenoma. In addition, metformin is a biguanide derivative that is long widely used for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and has recently been suggested to have a suppressive effect on carcinogenesis and cancer cell growth. Both drugs exhibit a chemopreventive effect, but their efficacy is limited.\n",
      "Aberrant crypt foci (ACF), defined as lesions containing crypts that are larger in diameter and stain more darkly with methylene blue than normal crypts, are more prevalent in patients with cancer and adenomas, and considered a reliable surrogate biomarker of CRC. Thus, we designed a prospective trial as a preliminary study prior to a CRC chemoprevention trial to evaluate the chemopreventive effect of aspirin combined with metformin on colorectal ACF formation in patients scheduled for polypectomy.\n",
      "This study is a double-blind randomized controlled trial that will be conducted in patients with both colorectal ACF and colorectal polyps scheduled for polypectomy. Eligible patients will be recruited for the study and the number of ACF in the rectum will be counted at the baseline colonoscopy. Then, the participants will be allocated to one of the following two groups; the aspirin plus placebo group or the aspirin plus metformin group. Patients in the aspirin plus placebo group will receive oral aspirin (100 mg) and placebo for 8 weeks, and those in the aspirin plus metformin group will receive oral aspirin (100 mg) and metformin (250 mg) for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks of administration, polypectomy will be performed to evaluate changes in the number of ACF, and the cell-proliferative activity in the normal colorectal mucosa and colorectal polyps.\n",
      "This is the first study proposed that will explore the effect of aspirin combined with metformin on the formation of colorectal ACF in humans.\n",
      "This trial has been registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN) Clinical Trials Registry as \n",
      "Cancer is a major health concern and the leading cause of death worldwide. The incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC) continues to increase worldwide [\n",
      "Patients with type 2 diabetes who were prescribed metformin have been reported to be at a low risk of cancer development, including CRC), compared with those who were not treated with metformin [\n",
      "The current recommended treatment for hypertension or diabetes mellitus is multiple drug combination therapy, which requires a lower dose of each drug to achieve a maximum therapeutic effect while avoiding toxic effects. Here, we hypothesize that aspirin and metformin combination therapy is more effective than single use of these drugs for CRC prevention. To test this hypothesis, this proposed study will investigate whether the combined use of aspirin and metformin shows a stronger chemopreventive effect than aspirin or metformin alone. In CRC chemoprevention trials, in general, the incidence of adenomas or the cancer itself is set as the study endpoint. Although the incidence rate of CRC is the most reliable endpoint, the use of this endpoint would be unsuitable for chemoprevention trials because of the relatively low occurrence rate of CRC in the general population [\n",
      "This study is designed as a double-blind placebo-control RCT to be performed in nondiabetic patients with both colorectal ACF and resectable polyps. It will be conducted in the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Yokohama City University (YCU) Hospital. The coordinating office will be at the YCU Hospital, and registration and data collection will be conducted at the YCU center for novel and exploratory clinical trials (Y-NEXT).\n",

Endoscopists, doctors at the follow-up outpatient clinics and patients will be blinded to the groups. Patients in the aspirin plus placebo group will receive oral aspirin (100 mg) and placebo per day for 8 weeks, and patients in the aspirin plus metformin group will receive 100 mg of aspirin and 250 mg of metformin per day for 8 weeks. At the end of the 8 weeks of administration of a colonoscopy will be performed to evaluate the number of rectal ACF.\n",
      "The primary endpoint will be the change in the number of colorectal ACF after 8 weeks of treatment. A magnifying colonoscope will be used in all cases (H260AZI, PCF-Q260AZI, PCF-Q290AZI, HZ290; Olympus Co., Tokyo, Japan), with carbon dioxide insufflation. Bowel preparation for the colonoscopy will be initiated one day before the procedure. Each patient will be instructed to consume a low-residue diet and take 5 mg of oral sodium picosulfate on the evening before the procedure. On the day of the procedure, each patient will be given 1500 ml of polyethylene glycol (PEG). If the stools are not sufficiently clear, an additional 500 ml of PEG will be given to ensure sufficient bowel cleaning. For conscious sedation, midazolam and pentazocine will be administered at the beginning of the procedure. Intramuscular glucagon or scopolamine will be administered to reduce colonic movements. At the time of the first colonoscopy, the endoscope will be inserted into the cecum, and the entire colorectum will be carefully observed as the endoscope is pulled back. Rectal epithelial samples will be obtained. The number of rectal ACFs will be counted as follows. First, the rectum will be washed with warm water, then sprayed with 0.25% methylene blue solution and stained for 2 min, washed again with warm water, and finally examined by magnifying endoscopy for ACFs. At the end of 8 weeks of administration, the same endoscopists will perform the polypectomy and counting of the ACF. All procedures will be recorded on DVD, and all of the ACF will be photographed. The number of ACF in each patient will be counted by the endoscopists during the colonoscopy. To further ensure validity, the number of ACF will be counted again through observation of the recorded DVD by 3 blinded expert endoscopists (H.T, A. J and A.K). If there was a discrepancy among the blinded specialists, we adopted the consent of at least two of the three. Additionaly if these expert endoscopists judge the colonoscopy examination as inadequate, that case will be excluded.\n",
      "The secondary outcomes will include (1) the drug safety; adverse events (AEs) will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 4.0. All study participants will be provided with a study diary to record the daily dosage of the study treatment and the AEs. Patients developing grade 3 or more severe AEs will be withdrawn from the study at that point. (2) Effects of additional metformin on the cell-proliferation in the rectal epithelium and polyps: Rectal epithelial samples will be obtained from the same trial patients by biopsy at the time of the first colonoscopy and polypectomy. Cell-proliferative activity will be evaluated by the analysis of the Ki-67 labeling indices. Briefly, immunochromatography will be carried out using a50-fold dilution of the Ki-67 antibody (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) and the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, we will randomly select six crypts and count the number of Ki67-positive cells per crypt. In total, ~ 250 cells will be counted at a magnification of × 400 using a bright-field microscope. The results will be presented as the percentage of Ki67-positive cells. All participants will undergo a physical examination and laboratory tests at the time of the baseline endoscopic examination and polypectomy.\n",
      "The investigator will repot the patient’s details to the central registration center via fax. After an eligibility check, the patients will be randomly assigned to receive aspirin plus placebo or aspirin plus metformin at the central registration center by a computer program that will block allocation by age and sex. In this way, the patient assignments will be concealed from the investigator. The randomization center will allocate a numbered treatment pack to each patient, which will contain all the drugs or placebos needed to complete a course of the trial treatment for one patient. Drug allocation was masked from all patients, endoscopists, doctors, and investigators until the end of the trial.\n",
      "Aspirin will be purchased from Bayer Pharma, Ltd. Metformin will be purchased from Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd. The placebo (250 mg lactose) will be purchased from Kondo photo process Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan. All trial drugs will be packaged identically and identified only by number. Subjects will be instructed to take two tablets of the trial drugs after breakfast each day. Compliance will be monitored by counting the empty drug packages returned by the patients at colonoscopy. The participants will be also interviewed and monitored that they had not used prohibited agents (aspirin, metformin and/or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). If serious adverse events or less than 80% drug compliance are confirmed in a patient, that patient will be removed from the final analysis.\n",
      "We previously showed that metformin administered at 250 mg/d for 1 year suppressed metachronous adenoma and the effectiveness was similar to previous aspirin chemoprevention trials [\n",

      "Study Flow\n",
      "This is the first study proposed to evaluate the chemopreventive effect of aspirin and metformin combination therapy in patients with rectal ACF. Given its role as an analgesic, antipyretic and agent for cardiovascular prophylaxis, aspirin has become one of the most commonly used drugs. Many studies have provided considerable evidence demonstrating its potential for the prevention of CRC. Aspirin exerts its anticancer effects through several interconnected mechanisms, including prostaglandin synthesis and catabolism in epithelial cells [\n",
      "This trial may have the following limitations. First, ACFs are considered as a reliable surrogate biomarker of CRC [\n",
      "If this combination therapy was found to be more effective for the prevention of CRC, the impact would be significant. Therefore, we consider it of interest to determine whether the combined use of aspirin and metformin shows a stronger chemopreventive effect on the formation of human colorectal ACFs than either aspirin or metformin alone.\n",

      "Recent evidence supports hippocampal avoidance with whole brain radiotherapy (HA-WBRT) as the recommended treatment option in patients with good prognosis and multiple brain metastases as this results in better neurocognitive preservation compared to whole brain radiotherapy. However, there is often poor tumour control with this technique due to the low doses given. Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS), a form of focused radiotherapy which is given to patients who have a limited number of brain metastases, delivers a higher radiation dose to the metastases resulting in better target lesion control. With improvements in radiation technology, advanced dose-painting techniques now allow a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) dose to lesions whilst minimising doses to the hippocampus to potentially improve brain tumour control and preserve cognitive outcomes. This technique is abbreviated to HA-SIB-WBRT or HA-WBRT+SIB.\n",
      "We hypothesise that the SIB in HA-SIB-WBRT (experimental arm) will result in better tumour control compared to HA-WBRT (control arm). This may also lead to better intracranial disease control as well as functional and survival outcomes. We aim to conduct a prospective randomised phase II trial in patients who have good performance status, multiple brain metastases (4–25 lesions) and a reasonable life expectancy (> 6 months). These patients will be stratified according to the number of brain metastases and randomised between the 2 arms. We aim for a recruitment of 100 patients from a single centre over a period of 2 years. Our primary endpoint is target lesion control. These patients will be followed up over the following year and data on imaging, toxicity, quality of life, activities of daily living and cognitive measurements will be collected at set time points. The results will then be compared across the 2 arms and analysed.\n",
      "Patients with brain metastases are living longer. Maintaining functional independence and intracranial disease control is thus increasingly important. Improving radiotherapy treatment techniques could provide better control and survival outcomes whilst maintaining quality of life, cognition and functional capacity. This trial will assess the benefits and possible toxicities of giving a SIB to HA-WBRT.\n",
      "None\n",
      "The management of brain metastases presents a significant challenge in oncology. Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is widely given to improve neurological symptoms, stop brain metastasis progression and possibly prolong survival. Unfortunately, neurocognitive functional decline is reported in a significant number of patients who undergo WBRT at rates of 31–57% at 3 months and 48–89% at 1 year [\n",
      "The hippocampus plays a key role in learning, memory and cognitive function [\n",
      "A recent phase 3 trial, NRG-CC001, randomised 518 patients to Hippocampal avoidance-WBRT (HA-WBRT) against standard WBRT. Cognitive endpoints were measured using a test battery of Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R), Controlled Oral Word Association, and Trail Making Test (TMT) Part A & B. At a median follow-up for alive patients of 7.9 months, a significant reduction in cognitive failure risk was noted (HR, 0.76; \n",
      "This trial introduced HA-WBRT as a new standard option in patients with multiple brain metastases and good prognosis. However, some clinicians would still favour the use of Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) over HA-WBRT in patients with low volume brain metastases. The reasons could possibly be better cognitive sparing or tumoral control due to the higher ablative doses used in SRS. Several trials are underway comparing the use of HA-WBRT against SRS (\n",
      "In the landmark RTOG 95–08 trial which compared an SRS boost vs. no boost in patients undergoing WBRT, the patients in the boost arm had improved local control rates, better functional autonomy and reduced steroid need with few toxicities [\n",
      "Several single-arm prospective studies looked at the use of WBRT+SIB or HA-SIB-WBRT in variable patient cohorts with SIB doses of 40–52.5Gy in 10–15 fractions [\n",
      "Given that brain metastases are being detected earlier and better systemic options have extended the survival in many patients, the need to maintain functional independence and brain disease control is increasingly important. In the management of brain metastases, there is still an unmet need for patients with good prognoses but are unable to receive SRS to have better intracranial disease control over the new standard of HA-WBRT. It is thus important to assess if the addition of a SIB will improve the outcomes of HA-WBRT.\n",
      "To our knowledge, there is no prospective trial underway comparing HA-SIB-WBRT against HA-WBRT. We thus aim to test if there is a clinical benefit for the additional SIB in HA-WBRT. In preparation for this trial, we performed a planning study to test the feasibility of dosimetric targets set for HA-SIB-WBRT in 5 patients with different tumour numbers, volumes and locations as well as experimented with various treatment planning techniques [\n",

The subgroup of women who underwent excision treatment was not a randomized group, so we had limited power to evaluate post-treatment vaccine efficacy. Furthermore, because no any sexual behavior data was collected, we were not able to evaluate the sexual behavior difference between two groups or estimate the effect of vaccination by adjusting the factor. However, a good balance regarding HPV status at enrollment had been achieved between the two arms, which indicated that there may be no significant difference in sexual behavior between the two groups. And we used cytological results as an outcome in the analysis due to not all women after treatment underwent colposcopy, which may have potential bias. Based on previous study [\n",

      "Postoperative pain and gastrointestinal dysfunction are two major stumbling blocks that affect the recovery of patients. In addition, as far as pain is concerned, acute and chronic pain that occur during hospitalization and after discharge have caused huge medical and healthcare pressure in European and American countries.\n",
      "Pain management plays a particularly important role in the rehabilitation process. ERAS emphasizes the necessity of effective pain relief targeting the trauma-induced stress.\n",
      "According to the theory of TCM, factors such as trauma and anesthesia can lead to Qi and blood obstructed or insufficient, which may cause kinds of pain or visceral dysfunction. Dialectical treatment is the foundation of TCM, and the principles are treating excess with purgation, treating insufficiency with tonification. The acupoints with more similar characteristic are chosen, the better therapeutic effects will achieve. Theoretically, among the selected acupoints in this trial, they are effective in harmonizing meridians and balancing Yin Yang. Hence TEAS with acupoints above took function of enhancing the recovery of patients.\n",
      "Based on the available evidence, the mechanisms of TEAS analgesia involves several systems such as endorphin system and adrenergic system, in which endorphin system plays a key role.\n",
      "Not only inner analgesics, there were changes in nociception-related factors such as trauma-induced inflammation. TNF-α and IL-6 both are important indicators to reflect the extent of stress and inflammation. TNF-α is the earliest inflammatory molecule under stress and it participates in the immunomodulation and anti-infection. IL-6 can integrate and cooperate other inflammatory signals to promote inflammation. After the patients suffering from surgical injury, the body will release a variety of nociceptive medias attributing pain. On the one hand, TNF-α and IL-6 which may overexpress under stress will increase in the injured tissue and central nervous system (CNS), then exacerbate inflammation. On the other hand, these inflammatory molecules also promote the release of phospholipids from tissue, then phospholipids break down into prostaglandins,\n",
      "So, superficially it may be another explanation that the anti-nociceptive effects of TEAS may through its regulation of inflammation. Based on what we mentioned above, we think that it may come down to the immunomodulation of TEAS. As we all know, it’s extremely common that patients with gastric cancer have immune dysfunction. Stress reactions of varying extent caused by operation, anesthesia and pain will further lead to immunosuppression.\n",
      "Postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction may occur because of surgical operation (damage of vagal nerve, changes in physiological structure), CO\n",
      "There were some limitations in this trial: (1) We did not collect and stratify the social class, personality characteristics which may cause unknown bias. (2) About secretion of transmitters such as endorphins, there is a circadian pattern in the body which may lead to a biological rhythm of pain. So, time deviation may exist in the process of collecting clinical data. (3) In the analysis of consumption of opioids, for pentazocine, the equivalent dose of morphine is 30 to 60 mg. Due to individual differences in pharmacodynamics, we have not found a clear equivalent dose for the Chinese constitution. (4) 2/100Hz mode is more common in other trials, and the reasons why we choose 20/100Hz are as follows. First, the frequency of 15–30Hz is more effective in promoting the release of oxytocin than 2–3Hz, and oxytocin can also relieve pain and enhance the analgesic effect of electroacupuncture. Second, 15Hz can both promote the release of β-End and Enk. Although it is not as effective as 2Hz in releasing β-End,\n",
      "In Summary, it was confirmed that TEAS played a role in relieving postoperative pain and promoting the recovery of gastrointestinal function, which may be related to the modulation of inflammation. And there was no adverse reaction during the entire trial. Therefore, TEAS can be used as an adjuvant therapy to enhance the postoperative recovery for patients with gastric cancer.\n",

      "Nausea and vomiting are among the most common and distressing side effects of chemotherapy. Difference in views about the effectiveness of auricular acupuncture (AA) versus electroacupuncture (EA) of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) lies at the heart of the debate. The aim of this study is to compare the antiemetic efficacy and safety of AA and EA for CINV.\n",

      "Initial results from various phase-III trials on vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are promising. For proper translation of these results to clinical guidelines, it is essential to determine how well the general population is reflected in the study populations of these trials. This study was conducted among 7162 participants (age-range: 51–106 years; 58% women) from the Rotterdam Study. We quantified the proportion of participants that would be eligible for the nine ongoing phase-III trials. We further quantified the eligibility among participants at high risk to develop severe COVID-19. Since many trials were not explicit in their exclusion criterion with respect to ‘acute’ or ‘unstable preexisting’ diseases, we performed two analyses. First, we included all participants irrespective of this criterion. Second, we excluded persons with acute or ‘unstable preexisting’ diseases. 97% of 7162 participants was eligible for any trial with eligibility for separate trials ranging between 11–97%. For high-risk individuals the corresponding numbers were 96% for any trial with separate trials ranging from 5–96%. Importantly, considering persons ineligible due to ‘acute’ or ‘unstable pre-existing’ disease drastically dropped the eligibilities for all trials below 43% for the total population and below 36% for high-risk individuals. The eligibility for ongoing vaccine trials against SARS-CoV-2 can reduce by half depending on interpretation and application of a single unspecified exclusion criterion. This exclusion criterion in our study would especially affect the elderly and those with pre-existing morbidities. These findings thus indicate the difficulty as well as importance of developing clinical recommendations for vaccination and applying these to the appropriate target populations. This becomes especially paramount considering the fact that many countries worldwide have initiated their vaccination programs by first targeting the elderly and most vulnerable persons.\n",

      "Several phase III trials on vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are ongoing and initial results highly promising. A major issue of these phase III trials is to what extent the included study population is representative of the intended (or target) population, i.e. external validity.\n",
      "For these trials, the intended target population is initially comprised of high-risk individuals usually considered to be elderly persons as well as those with comorbidities, and ultimately the entire world population. It remains unclear whether these target populations are representatively recruited into ongoing trials. This information is pivotal, since clinical recommendations for any approved vaccine should incorporate the proper target populations for which these vaccines have shown efficacy, and also determine those populations not sufficiently represented in the trials.\n",
      "We sought to quantify the external validity of the various ongoing trials to a middle-aged and elderly West-European population from the Rotterdam Study.

      "Clinical trials are often considered the golden standard in efficacy research, due to several strengths by design with respect to internal validity. In contrast, whether findings from clinical trials are adequately translated to clinical practice also depends on their external validity. External validity is the extent to which findings from one study are applicable to target populations not represented in the actual study population.

Therefore, an effective treatment regimen with fewer side effects is needed.\n",

      "A recent study of the 5-year survival in a randomized phase III study of cisplatin with pemetrexed versus cisplatin with vinorelbine for completely resected stage II-IIIA non-squamous NSCLC (the JIPANG study) was reported (ASCO 2019 8501). The JIPANG study failed to show the superiority of pemetrexed plus cisplatin over vinorelbine plus cisplatin and the cost of pemetrexed is high. However, the regimen will be considered as an option for adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II-IIIA non-squamous NSCLC since the effect is comparable and the patients treated with cisplatin and pemetrexed had a higher completion rate with low adverse reactions compared to the patients treated with cisplatin and vinorelbine. Another recent approach is the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) for postoperative patients. Several clinical trials of ICI with/without chemotherapy are currently underway in adjuvant setting [\n",
      "S-1 might be another candidate for mild adjuvant chemotherapy for NSCLC. The oral fluoropyrimidine derivative which consists of tegafur and two modulators, 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine (CDHP) and potassium oxonate (Oxo), enhances 5-FU efficacy by inhibiting degradation of 5-FU and reduces the GI toxicity caused by 5-FU [\n",
      "Feasibility studies of S-1 based adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage IB to IIIA NSCLC have also been conducted [\n",
      "The low incidence of adverse reaction directly correlates with the quality of life of the treated patients. Because of mild adverse reactions, S-1 can be administrated for outpatients without hospitalization and treated patients can continue daily life and working, which will maintain the social productivity of the treated individuals. The evaluation of quality of life (QOL) and work productivity of postoperative patients shows the advantage of S-1 chemotherapy versus standard platinum doublet adjuvant chemotherapy. Taken together, these findings have enabled us to design the current phase II study to confirm the beneficial effects of S-1 in adjuvant chemotherapy.

We designed the sample size to estimate the 2-year-RFS with the accuracy determined to be the width of the 95% confidence interval for the 2 year-RFS to be less than 20%. The 2-year RFS was expected to be 65%. Assuming an estimate at the 95% confidence interval for the 2 year-RFS with the Wilson’s method, 84 patients are necessary for each arm. Estimating around 10% drop outs, we set the total number of patients to be 190. The above sample size was set to assure the statistical power to quantitatively compare the primary point between the arms. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the clinical significance of the S1 monotherapy by integrating the observed data of the RFSs, QOL and adverse events of the two arms.\n",

      "Since 2004, cisplatin with vinorelbine has been the preferred treatment for patients who have undergone complete resection of stage II to IIIA NSCLC and the recommended regimen has not been changed in more than 16 years. Because the adverse reactions are severe in the cisplatin with vinorelbine regime, the Lung Cancer Group in Kyusyu (LOGIK) is conducting the LOGIK1702 study in order to compare the efficacy of milder chemotherapy using S-1 compared to the standard regimen of cisplatin with vinorelbine. S-1 chemotherapy has been successfully used for other cancers and is recommended for intestinal adjuvant chemotherapy. In previous studies using cisplatin doublet based adjuvant chemotherapies most of the relapses occurred within 2-years following the operation and the survival curve came to a plateau thereafter [\n",
      "The limitation of the present study is that this randomized study is not aimed at evaluating statistical comparison of the difference in prognoses between the two arms. Rather, this study is aimed at providing basic information for improving the performance evaluation of a future randomized phase III study.

      "In this prospective study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of ICG-hyaluronic acid as a novel agent for localizing non-palpable breast lesions. There were no AEs in any of the groups, and there were no significant intergroup differences in histopathological accuracy, breast lesion marking rates, or excised specimen marking rates. However, there were significant intergroup differences in resection accuracy and skin pigmentation rates.\n",
      "Excised non-palpable lesions identified by localization could be larger than the excised palpable lesions. The accuracy of resection (the greatest diameter of the excised specimen divided by the greatest diameter of the preoperative lesion as detected by US) reflects the ratio of over-excision. Accuracy values closer to 1 reflect a concordance in size between the ultrasonographically defined lesion and the excised specimen. The mean accuracy value was 3.7 in control group, which was higher than the accuracy value in Test Group 1 and Test Group 2 (p = 0.037 and 0.026, respectively). These differences might have been because the injection dose of activated charcoal (0.3 to 1.0 mL) was much higher than that of the ICG-hyaluronic acid mixture (0.1 mL or 0.2 mL). If activated charcoal had been administered using the same dosage as the ICG-hyaluronic acid mixture, it would have been a proportional comparison. However, if ICG-hyaluronic acid mixture 0.3 to 1.0 mL had been used, localization would have been impossible because of the spread with blur. For the ICG-hyaluronic acid mixture injection, over 60 injections into tissue phantom models (pickle pieces in pork belly) were attempted to determine the appropriate doses and needle thicknesses. The radiologists were technically familiar with and aware of the agents used for localization. Before the implementation of this study, more than 500 breast lesion localizations with charcoal were performed annually at our center. Technical difficulties were not found in the injection of charcoal and ICG-hyaluronic acid mixture. Since a smaller resection could mean a better cosmetic result, the higher resection accuracy in the test groups relative to the control group could have reflected better cosmetic outcomes in the test groups.\n",
      "Additionally, there was no difference in accuracy between Test Group 1 using 0.1 mL of ICG-hyaluronic acid mixture and Test Group 2 using 0.2 mL of ICG-hyaluronic acid (p = 0.744). Further, there were no differences in the breast lesion marking rates or excised specimen marking rates between the test groups. For localization, ICG-hyaluronic acid could be used at a dosage of either 0.1 mL or 0.2 mL.\n",
      "The histopathological accuracy (the greatest diameter of the histopathological lesion divided by the greatest diameter of the excised specimen) is a unique variable in our study. Values closer to 1 reflected resections that more closely aligned with the actual histopathological lesions. There were nine cases for which histopathologic measurements were impossible; hence, the sample size was insufficient to assess efficacy in terms of this variable.\n",
      "The greatest US-measured preoperative lesion diameters were mostly under 2 cm, but the longest diameter was 8 cm in one of the lesions in the control group that was later diagnosed as malignant. The diameter of the excised specimen depended on the histological result, not on the differences between the three groups, which reflects the tendency toward larger margins associated with the resection of malignant vs. benign lesions. If we analyzed only malignant lesions, we would have obtained more accurate results, but this was impossible with so few patients. Our patient group was heterogeneous because only benign lesions were included in the study, but hidden malignancies were discovered after surgery. In the future, we are planning a phase-3 clinical trial to evaluate positive margin rates among cancer patients.\n",
      "In previous studies, tattooing has been used for various medical purposes [\n",
      "Meanwhile, we have presented a new use for ICG-hyaluronic acid. ICG-hyaluronic acid had advantages over activated charcoal in that there was no skin pigmentation and less pain because of the smaller needle (21-gauge versus 18-gauge) used for ICG-hyaluronic acid injection. However, it had a disadvantage in that it could be visualized only via near-infrared fluorescence, so additional equipment was needed.\n",
      "This study had several limitations. First, the sample size was small, and there was no long-term follow-up. Second, we used only diameter (cm) without volume (cm3 or mL), which better reflects resection margins [\n",
      "This was a multicenter phase-2 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ICG-hyaluronic acid mixture for localization relative to that of activated charcoal. ICG-hyaluronic acid injection was a new method for localization and useful for obtaining accurate resection as well as cosmetic benefits. Further research is required for the method to be widely used. We have studied a small number of patients with benign breast lesions, but we need to study a larger number of patients with malignant lesions to determine the accuracy and histopathological positive margin rate of this novel method compared with other localization methods. Further research about AEs or survival rates after long-term follow-up should be considered. In the future, we are planning a phase-3 clinical trial to evaluate positive margin rates among cancer patients.\n",

      "Patients with polymetastatic cancer are most often treated with systemic therapy to improve overall survival and/or delay progression, with palliative radiotherapy reserved for sites of symptomatic disease. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) has shown promise in the treatment of oligometastatic disease, but the utility of SABR in treating all sites of polymetastatic disease has yet to be evaluated. This study aims to evaluate the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of SABR in patients with polymetastatic disease.\n",
      "Up to 48 patients with polymetastatic cancer (> 10 sites) will be enrolled on this phase I, modified 3 + 3 design trial. Eligible patients will have exhausted (or refused) standard systemic therapy options. SABR will be delivered as an escalating number of weekly fractions of 6 Gy, starting at 6 Gy × 2 weekly fractions (dose level 1). The highest dose level (dose level 4) will be 6 Gy × 5 weekly fractions. Feasibility and safety of SABR will be evaluated 6 weeks following treatment using a composite endpoint of successfully completing treatment as well as toxicity outcomes.\n",

      "Treatment planning futility will be considered if less than 33% of the patients (to a maximum of 9 patients) at a specific dose level can successfully have a treatment plan generated for that dose level meeting organ at risk constraints. If treatment planning futility is encountered, the MTD will be considered as the dose level preceding the failed dose level.\n",

      "This novel phase I trial seeks to investigate the MTD of SABR delivered to patients with polymetastatic cancer who have exhausted (or refused further standard of care) systemic therapy options. We believe that initial evaluation with a rigorous phase I trial is necessary to determine what treatment dose can be safely considered in patients with polymetastatic cancer prior to embarking on evaluation of the potential efficacy of this treatment modality.\n",
      "Precedent for the treatment of extensive metastatic disease with radiotherapy exists in the experience of using hemi-body radiotherapy for palliation of diffuse bone metastases [\n",
      "Further rationale for exploring SABR in the polymetastatic setting comes from emerging randomized evidence that supports aggressive radiotherapy to the primary tumour, either with SABR or conventional (chemo) radiation in patients newly diagnosed with polymetastatic prostate [\n",
      "In designing this trial, we chose to evaluate dose levels in incremental fractions of 6 Gy for several reasons. First, this dose level represents familiarity in the context of hemi-body radiotherapy. While hemi-body radiotherapy has fallen out of favour due to enhancements in systemic therapy and improvements in radiopharmaceuticals, the experience of using this technique serves as the rationale behind using 6 Gy fractions of SABR. The starting dose of 12 Gy in 2 weekly fractions should also be expected to offer palliation of symptomatic metastases. Second, by escalating the number of fractions but keeping the dose per fraction consistent, an optimal radiotherapy treatment plan can be generated for the target dose level. If this optimal treatment plan does not to meet dose constraints at the target dose level, the number of fractions can be easily decreased without needing to generate a new radiotherapy plan. This allows for increased efficiency of workflow in a setting where we anticipate treatment plan generation will be resource intensive and time consuming. Third, delivering the fractions once per week allows for careful evaluation of potential, unanticipated toxicity during treatment. For example, we are carefully evaluating for the possibility of bone marrow suppression due to SABR, particularly in our chosen patient population who have exhausted (or refuse) further lines of systemic therapy and may have pre-existing myelosuppression. Finally, while the doses of SABR within this trial would not typically be considered below truly ablative doses, we believe the maximum dose level will strike an acceptable balance between anticipated efficacy, treatment intent, and potential toxicity.\n",
      "Our study population was carefully considered for creation of this novel phase I trial. We chose to evaluate a subset of patients where systemic therapy use at the time of SABR is unlikely to interfere acutely with the evaluation of the MTD, as no standard systemic therapy options are available (or are refused by the patient). It is also unlikely that any toxicity from SABR in this study would interfere with the possibility of receiving subsequent systemic therapy that may become available or the patient chooses to access. However, patients enrolled on this study are expected to have been heavily pretreated with systemic therapy, which may influence secondary endpoints in our trial such as progression-free survival and overall survival. Some have argued phase I trials should be offered earlier in the treatment pathway for patients [\n",
      "ARREST is a novel phase I trial leveraging the availability of modern image guided radiotherapy for the treatment of polymetastatic disease. Such treatment, if shown to be safe and tolerable, may provide additional treatment options for patients with extensive metastases who are ineligible or unwilling to undertake palliative systemic therapies.\n",

      "The classical pathway for diagnosing prostate cancer is systematic 12-core biopsy under the guidance of transrectal ultrasound, which tends to underdiagnose the clinically significant tumour and overdiagnose the insignificant disease.

Targeted biopsy, which is mainly divided into cognitive fusion method and software-based fusion method, is getting prevalent for its good performance in detecting significant cancer. However, the preferred targeted biopsy technique in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer between cognitive fusion and software-based fusion is still beyond consensus.\n",
      "This trial is a prospective, single-centre, randomised controlled and non-inferiority study in which all men suspicious to have clinically significant prostate cancer are included. This study aims to determine whether a novel three-dimensional matrix positioning cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy is non-inferior to software-based fusion-targeted biopsy in the detection rate of clinically significant cancer in men without a prior biopsy. The main inclusion criteria are men with elevated serum prostate-specific antigen above 4–20 ng/mL or with an abnormal digital rectal examination and have never had a biopsy before. A sample size of 602 participants allowing for a 10% loss will be recruited. All patients will undergo a multiparametric MRI examination, and those who fail to be found with a suspicious lesion, with the anticipation of half of the total number, will be dropped. The remaining participants will be randomly allocated to cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy (n=137) and software-based fusion-targeted biopsy (n=137). The primary outcome is the detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer for cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy and software-based fusion-targeted biopsy in men without a prior biopsy. The clinically significant prostate cancer will be defined as the International Society of Urological Pathology grade group 2 or higher.\n",
