To assess the impact of adding statin (atorvastatin) and/or aspirin on clinical deterioration in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who require hospitalisation. The safety of these drugs in COVID-19 patients will also be evaluated.
This is a single-centre, prospective, four-arm parallel design, open-label, randomized control trial.
The study will be conducted at National Cancer Institute (NCI), Jhajjar, Haryana, which is a part of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, and has been converted into a dedicated COVID-19 management centre since the outbreak of the pandemic. All RT-PCR confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection with age ≥ 40 years and < 75 years requiring hospital admission (patients with WHO clinical improvement ordinal score 3 to 5) will be included in the trial. Written informed consent will be taken for all recruited patients. Patients with a critical illness (WHO clinical improvement ordinal score > 5), documented significant liver disease/dysfunction (aspartate transaminase [AST] / alanine aminotransferase [ALT] > 240), myopathy and rhabdomyolysis (creatine phosphokinase [CPK] > 5x normal), allergy or intolerance to statins or aspirin, prior statin or aspirin use within 30 days, history of active gastrointestinal bleeding in past three months, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100000/ dl), pregnancy, active breastfeeding, or inability to take oral or nasogastric medications will be excluded. Patients refusing to give written consent and taking drugs that are known to have a significant drug interaction with statin or aspirin [including cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors, hepatitis C protease inhibitor, telaprevir, fibric acid derivatives (gemfibrozil), niacin, azole antifungals (itraconazole, ketoconazole), clarithromycin and colchicine] will also be excluded from the trial.
In this study, the benefit and safety of atorvastatin (statin) and/or aspirin as adjuvant therapy will be compared with the control group receiving usual care for management of COVID-19. Atorvastatin will be prescribed as 40 mg oral tablets once daily for ten days or until discharge, whichever is earlier. The dose of aspirin will be 75 mg once daily for ten days or until discharge, whichever is earlier. All other therapies will be administered according to the institute’s COVID-19 treatment protocol and the treating physician’s clinical judgment.
All study participants will be prospectively followed up for ten days or until hospital discharge, whichever is longer for outcomes. The primary outcome will be clinical deterioration characterized by progression to WHO clinical improvement ordinal score ≥ 6 (i.e., endotracheal intubation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, pressor agents, renal replacement therapy, ECMO requirement, and mortality). The secondary outcomes will be change in serum inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and Interleukin-6), Troponin I, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) from time zero to 5th day of study enrolment or 7th day after symptom onset, whichever is later. Other clinical outcomes that will be assessed include progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), shock, ICU admission, length of ICU admission, length of hospital admission, and in-hospital mortality. Adverse drug effects like myalgia, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, hepatotoxicity, and bleeding will also be examined in the trial to assess the safety of the interventions.
The study will use a four-arm parallel-group design. A computer-generated permuted block randomization with mixed block size will be used to randomize the participants in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to group A (atorvastatin with conventional therapy), group B (aspirin with conventional therapy), group C (aspirin + atorvastatin with conventional therapy), and group D (control; only conventional therapy).
The study will be an open-label trial.
As there is no existing study that has evaluated the role of aspirin and atorvastatin in COVID-19 patients, formal sample size calculation has not been done. Patients satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited during six months of study period. Once the first 200 patients are included in each arm (i.e., total 800 patients), the final sample size calculation will be done on the basis of the interim analysis of the collected data.

The incidence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) continue to increase worldwide. Therefore, new preventive strategies are needed to lower the burden of this disease. Previous studies reported that aspirin could suppress the development of sporadic colorectal adenoma. In addition, metformin is a biguanide derivative that is long widely used for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and has recently been suggested to have a suppressive effect on carcinogenesis and cancer cell growth. Both drugs exhibit a chemopreventive effect, but their efficacy is limited.
Aberrant crypt foci (ACF), defined as lesions containing crypts that are larger in diameter and stain more darkly with methylene blue than normal crypts, are more prevalent in patients with cancer and adenomas, and considered a reliable surrogate biomarker of CRC. Thus, we designed a prospective trial as a preliminary study prior to a CRC chemoprevention trial to evaluate the chemopreventive effect of aspirin combined with metformin on colorectal ACF formation in patients scheduled for polypectomy.
This study is a double-blind randomized controlled trial that will be conducted in patients with both colorectal ACF and colorectal polyps scheduled for polypectomy. Eligible patients will be recruited for the study and the number of ACF in the rectum will be counted at the baseline colonoscopy. Then, the participants will be allocated to one of the following two groups; the aspirin plus placebo group or the aspirin plus metformin group. Patients in the aspirin plus placebo group will receive oral aspirin (100 mg) and placebo for 8 weeks, and those in the aspirin plus metformin group will receive oral aspirin (100 mg) and metformin (250 mg) for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks of administration, polypectomy will be performed to evaluate changes in the number of ACF, and the cell-proliferative activity in the normal colorectal mucosa and colorectal polyps.
This is the first study proposed that will explore the effect of aspirin combined with metformin on the formation of colorectal ACF in humans.
This trial has been registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN) Clinical Trials Registry as 
Cancer is a major health concern and the leading cause of death worldwide. The incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC) continues to increase worldwide [
Patients with type 2 diabetes who were prescribed metformin have been reported to be at a low risk of cancer development, including CRC), compared with those who were not treated with metformin [
The current recommended treatment for hypertension or diabetes mellitus is multiple drug combination therapy, which requires a lower dose of each drug to achieve a maximum therapeutic effect while avoiding toxic effects. Here, we hypothesize that aspirin and metformin combination therapy is more effective than single use of these drugs for CRC prevention. To test this hypothesis, this proposed study will investigate whether the combined use of aspirin and metformin shows a stronger chemopreventive effect than aspirin or metformin alone. In CRC chemoprevention trials, in general, the incidence of adenomas or the cancer itself is set as the study endpoint. Although the incidence rate of CRC is the most reliable endpoint, the use of this endpoint would be unsuitable for chemoprevention trials because of the relatively low occurrence rate of CRC in the general population [
This study is designed as a double-blind placebo-control RCT to be performed in nondiabetic patients with both colorectal ACF and resectable polyps. It will be conducted in the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Yokohama City University (YCU) Hospital. The coordinating office will be at the YCU Hospital, and registration and data collection will be conducted at the YCU center for novel and exploratory clinical trials (Y-NEXT).
The study protocol complies with the Declaration of Helsinki [
Patients with both colorectal ACF and resectable polyps will be recruited for this study. The inclusion criteria are as follows:

Patients with resectable polyps.
Patients with more than 10 rectal ACF.
Willingness to provide written informed consent.
The exclusion criteria are as follows:

Patients with lesions for which preferred early resection is preferred.
History of regular use (defined as at least once per week) of NSAIDs and/or aspirin.
History of regular use of warfarin and/or direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC).
History of diabetes mellitus (defined as a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level more than 6.5% or regular use of anti-diabetic drugs).
History of heart failure, renal failure, liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatic failure.
History of familial adenomatous polyposis, hereditary non-polyposis CRC and inflammatory bowel disease.
Pregnancy or possibility of pregnancy.
Contraindication to aspirin or metformin.
Allergy to aspirin or metformin
Patients judged as inappropriate candidates for the trial by the investigators.
All eligible patients will be randomly allocated to one of the two following groups; the aspirin plus placebo group and aspirin plus metformin group. Endoscopists, doctors at the follow-up outpatient clinics and patients will be blinded to the groups. Patients in the aspirin plus placebo group will receive oral aspirin (100 mg) and placebo per day for 8 weeks, and patients in the aspirin plus metformin group will receive 100 mg of aspirin and 250 mg of metformin per day for 8 weeks. At the end of the 8 weeks of administration of a colonoscopy will be performed to evaluate the number of rectal ACF.
The primary endpoint will be the change in the number of colorectal ACF after 8 weeks of treatment. A magnifying colonoscope will be used in all cases (H260AZI, PCF-Q260AZI, PCF-Q290AZI, HZ290; Olympus Co., Tokyo, Japan), with carbon dioxide insufflation. Bowel preparation for the colonoscopy will be initiated one day before the procedure. Each patient will be instructed to consume a low-residue diet and take 5 mg of oral sodium picosulfate on the evening before the procedure. On the day of the procedure, each patient will be given 1500 ml of polyethylene glycol (PEG). If the stools are not sufficiently clear, an additional 500 ml of PEG will be given to ensure sufficient bowel cleaning. For conscious sedation, midazolam and pentazocine will be administered at the beginning of the procedure. Intramuscular glucagon or scopolamine will be administered to reduce colonic movements. At the time of the first colonoscopy, the endoscope will be inserted into the cecum, and the entire colorectum will be carefully observed as the endoscope is pulled back. Rectal epithelial samples will be obtained. The number of rectal ACFs will be counted as follows. First, the rectum will be washed with warm water, then sprayed with 0.25% methylene blue solution and stained for 2 min, washed again with warm water, and finally examined by magnifying endoscopy for ACFs. At the end of 8 weeks of administration, the same endoscopists will perform the polypectomy and counting of the ACF. All procedures will be recorded on DVD, and all of the ACF will be photographed. The number of ACF in each patient will be counted by the endoscopists during the colonoscopy. To further ensure validity, the number of ACF will be counted again through observation of the recorded DVD by 3 blinded expert endoscopists (H.T, A. J and A.K). If there was a discrepancy among the blinded specialists, we adopted the consent of at least two of the three. Additionaly if these expert endoscopists judge the colonoscopy examination as inadequate, that case will be excluded.
The secondary outcomes will include (1) the drug safety; adverse events (AEs) will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 4.0. All study participants will be provided with a study diary to record the daily dosage of the study treatment and the AEs. Patients developing grade 3 or more severe AEs will be withdrawn from the study at that point. (2) Effects of additional metformin on the cell-proliferation in the rectal epithelium and polyps: Rectal epithelial samples will be obtained from the same trial patients by biopsy at the time of the first colonoscopy and polypectomy. Cell-proliferative activity will be evaluated by the analysis of the Ki-67 labeling indices. Briefly, immunochromatography will be carried out using a50-fold dilution of the Ki-67 antibody (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) and the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, we will randomly select six crypts and count the number of Ki67-positive cells per crypt. In total, ~ 250 cells will be counted at a magnification of × 400 using a bright-field microscope. The results will be presented as the percentage of Ki67-positive cells. All participants will undergo a physical examination and laboratory tests at the time of the baseline endoscopic examination and polypectomy.
The investigator will repot the patient’s details to the central registration center via fax. After an eligibility check, the patients will be randomly assigned to receive aspirin plus placebo or aspirin plus metformin at the central registration center by a computer program that will block allocation by age and sex. In this way, the patient assignments will be concealed from the investigator. The randomization center will allocate a numbered treatment pack to each patient, which will contain all the drugs or placebos needed to complete a course of the trial treatment for one patient. Drug allocation was masked from all patients, endoscopists, doctors, and investigators until the end of the trial.
Aspirin will be purchased from Bayer Pharma, Ltd. Metformin will be purchased from Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd. The placebo (250 mg lactose) will be purchased from Kondo photo process Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan. All trial drugs will be packaged identically and identified only by number. Subjects will be instructed to take two tablets of the trial drugs after breakfast each day. Compliance will be monitored by counting the empty drug packages returned by the patients at colonoscopy. The participants will be also interviewed and monitored that they had not used prohibited agents (aspirin, metformin and/or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). If serious adverse events or less than 80% drug compliance are confirmed in a patient, that patient will be removed from the final analysis.
We previously showed that metformin administered at 250 mg/d for 1 year suppressed metachronous adenoma and the effectiveness was similar to previous aspirin chemoprevention trials [
The changes of ACFs number in each group, the primary endpoint, will be compared between the aspirin plus placebo group and the aspirin plus metformin group by the Student 
The Trial Steering Committee and Data Monitoring Committee will be located in the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Yokohama City University Hospital. The Management Team will monitor the trial progress status and data by face-to-face and/or telephonic contact with each of the trial investigators every month.

Study Flow
This is the first study proposed to evaluate the chemopreventive effect of aspirin and metformin combination therapy in patients with rectal ACF. Given its role as an analgesic, antipyretic and agent for cardiovascular prophylaxis, aspirin has become one of the most commonly used drugs. Many studies have provided considerable evidence demonstrating its potential for the prevention of CRC. Aspirin exerts its anticancer effects through several interconnected mechanisms, including prostaglandin synthesis and catabolism in epithelial cells [
This trial may have the following limitations. First, ACFs are considered as a reliable surrogate biomarker of CRC [
If this combination therapy was found to be more effective for the prevention of CRC, the impact would be significant. Therefore, we consider it of interest to determine whether the combined use of aspirin and metformin shows a stronger chemopreventive effect on the formation of human colorectal ACFs than either aspirin or metformin alone.

Recent evidence supports hippocampal avoidance with whole brain radiotherapy (HA-WBRT) as the recommended treatment option in patients with good prognosis and multiple brain metastases as this results in better neurocognitive preservation compared to whole brain radiotherapy. However, there is often poor tumour control with this technique due to the low doses given. Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS), a form of focused radiotherapy which is given to patients who have a limited number of brain metastases, delivers a higher radiation dose to the metastases resulting in better target lesion control. With improvements in radiation technology, advanced dose-painting techniques now allow a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) dose to lesions whilst minimising doses to the hippocampus to potentially improve brain tumour control and preserve cognitive outcomes. This technique is abbreviated to HA-SIB-WBRT or HA-WBRT+SIB.
We hypothesise that the SIB in HA-SIB-WBRT (experimental arm) will result in better tumour control compared to HA-WBRT (control arm). This may also lead to better intracranial disease control as well as functional and survival outcomes. We aim to conduct a prospective randomised phase II trial in patients who have good performance status, multiple brain metastases (4–25 lesions) and a reasonable life expectancy (> 6 months). These patients will be stratified according to the number of brain metastases and randomised between the 2 arms. We aim for a recruitment of 100 patients from a single centre over a period of 2 years. Our primary endpoint is target lesion control. These patients will be followed up over the following year and data on imaging, toxicity, quality of life, activities of daily living and cognitive measurements will be collected at set time points. The results will then be compared across the 2 arms and analysed.
Patients with brain metastases are living longer. Maintaining functional independence and intracranial disease control is thus increasingly important. Improving radiotherapy treatment techniques could provide better control and survival outcomes whilst maintaining quality of life, cognition and functional capacity. This trial will assess the benefits and possible toxicities of giving a SIB to HA-WBRT.

The management of brain metastases presents a significant challenge in oncology. Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is widely given to improve neurological symptoms, stop brain metastasis progression and possibly prolong survival. Unfortunately, neurocognitive functional decline is reported in a significant number of patients who undergo WBRT at rates of 31–57% at 3 months and 48–89% at 1 year [
The hippocampus plays a key role in learning, memory and cognitive function [
A recent phase 3 trial, NRG-CC001, randomised 518 patients to Hippocampal avoidance-WBRT (HA-WBRT) against standard WBRT. Cognitive endpoints were measured using a test battery of Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R), Controlled Oral Word Association, and Trail Making Test (TMT) Part A & B. At a median follow-up for alive patients of 7.9 months, a significant reduction in cognitive failure risk was noted (HR, 0.76; 
This trial introduced HA-WBRT as a new standard option in patients with multiple brain metastases and good prognosis. However, some clinicians would still favour the use of Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) over HA-WBRT in patients with low volume brain metastases. The reasons could possibly be better cognitive sparing or tumoral control due to the higher ablative doses used in SRS. Several trials are underway comparing the use of HA-WBRT against SRS (
In the landmark RTOG 95–08 trial which compared an SRS boost vs. no boost in patients undergoing WBRT, the patients in the boost arm had improved local control rates, better functional autonomy and reduced steroid need with few toxicities [
Several single-arm prospective studies looked at the use of WBRT+SIB or HA-SIB-WBRT in variable patient cohorts with SIB doses of 40–52.5Gy in 10–15 fractions [
Given that brain metastases are being detected earlier and better systemic options have extended the survival in many patients, the need to maintain functional independence and brain disease control is increasingly important. In the management of brain metastases, there is still an unmet need for patients with good prognoses but are unable to receive SRS to have better intracranial disease control over the new standard of HA-WBRT. It is thus important to assess if the addition of a SIB will improve the outcomes of HA-WBRT.
To our knowledge, there is no prospective trial underway comparing HA-SIB-WBRT against HA-WBRT. We thus aim to test if there is a clinical benefit for the additional SIB in HA-WBRT. In preparation for this trial, we performed a planning study to test the feasibility of dosimetric targets set for HA-SIB-WBRT in 5 patients with different tumour numbers, volumes and locations as well as experimented with various treatment planning techniques [
We hypothesise that HA-SIB-WBRT will be able to increase both target tumour and intracranial disease control compared with HA-WBRT alone. This, therefore, has the potential to impact on survival outcomes whilst maintaining cognitive function and quality of life.
The purpose of the study is to assess the impact that adding SIB to standard of care treatment (HA-WBRT) has on local control, survival outcomes, cognition and other patient reported outcome measures (PROMs).
This study will be conducted as a single centre prospective randomised phase II trial in patients with multiple brain metastases and good prognosis (> 6 months). The patients will be compared between the 2 arms: HA-WBRT (control) vs. HA-SIB-WBRT (experimental). The target recruitment is 100 patients over 2 years.
The trial will be conducted at the National Cancer Centre Singapore, which is the largest cancer centre in the country. The study workflow is depicted in Fig.

Patients whose plans are unable to meet the recommended constraints will not be eligible for the trial and will be dropped out and undergo WBRT or HA-WBRT as standard of care treatment. Patients can also voluntarily or involuntarily drop-out of the trial at any time after enrolment. These patients will not be replaced. The reason for drop-out must be recorded.
All treatment plans in the experimental arm will be reviewed and approved at the weekly Neuro-radiation oncology team audits prior to the start of treatment. Immobilisation will be performed in all patients. Daily image verification by image-guided radiotherapy is required.
All concomitant treatments should be documented. The use of concurrent cytotoxic systemic treatments is not allowed as this could cause additional or unexpected neuro-toxicities. If the participant is on systemic treatments, a treatment break of at least 7 days for immunotherapy or chemotherapy and 3 days for targeted therapy is recommended before and after radiotherapy. Interruptions should be discussed with the patient’s prescribing medical oncologist.
The use of dexamethasone during radiotherapy is not mandatory but is recommended for use if the patient with symptomatic brain metastases, significant cerebral oedema, large tumours or posterior cranial fossa lesions. The concurrent use of memantine for cognitive protection is recommended but not mandated.

All time points will be taken from the time of randomisation to event. If response assessment of the target lesion(s) is uncertain or equivocal, this should be reassessed by a multi-disciplinary team for clarification. When needed, this may be followed up with advanced imaging or histology.
Cognitive function, ADL and QoL will be assessed using patient-directed questionnaires that have been validated, available in local languages and used in the trials mentioned earlier for ease of comparison. These tests are optional but encouraged for all patients and will be conducted by a trained physician or clinical research associate at specified time points (Table 
Schedule of Enrolment, Interventions, and Assessments Recommended Follow-up Schedule Protocol^
^The follow-up schedule is based on current recommended routine practice. A window period of +/− 2 weeks is allowed for the 1st month follow up visit. +/− 1 month is allowed for the 3rd, 6th and 12th month follow-up visit. It is advised that this be followed for standardisation of records, however individual deviations will be allowed. 
*Only in females with child-bearing potential
Assuming a 6-month target lesion control rate of 50% in the HA-WBRT arm, we will need 60 subjects (30 per arm) to detect a hazard ratio of 0.27 [
Patients recruited will be stratified by the number of brain metastases < 10 vs. ≥10. Within each stratum, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to control vs. experimental arms. Simple randomization will be performed using a computer-generated random sequence allocation. This will be performed by the research coordinator after informed consent has been taken. The allocation sequence is concealed from the investigators. Patients and treating radiation oncologist will not be blinded to the intervention as it was opined that our patients would want to be aware of the treatment received and that unblinding would not significantly affect our primary objective measure.
Data (soft-copy) will be kept in a password protected database “SingHealth REDCap”. All documented (hard copy) data including consent forms, data collection forms and neurocognitive, functional and ADL assessment forms will be stored in a secured research folder. Research coordinators will help ensure per-protocol follow-up and filling-in of data targets. 3-monthly random checks on the data will be performed by the investigators to ensure integrity and quality.
Efficacy analyses will be performed using the intention-to-treat principle. Per-protocol analyses may be performed as secondary analyses. Safety analyses will include all patients who started treatment and will be performed according to the actual treatment received.
The primary endpoint, time to target lesion progression, will be defined as the time from randomisation to target lesion progression. Patients who pass away before documented target lesion progression will be censored at the last brain imaging assessment. Time to target lesion progression will be compared between the 2 treatment groups using a 2-sided log-rank test.
Time to intracranial progression, time to symptomatic brain progression, progression-free survival and overall survival will be defined as the time from randomisation to intracranial progression, symptomatic brain progression, overall progression and death from any cause respectively. All time-to-event endpoints will be summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method. Treatment arms will be compared using log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for the stratification variable (number of brain metastases). Other prognostic variables such as histology, ECOG status and disease-specific GPA class may also be included in the Cox models.
Adverse events will be recorded according to CTCAE version 5.0 and summarised by treatment arm.
Cognitive test (HVLT-R and CTT) scores will be standardised based on published norms: (Patient value – Published-norm mean value) ÷ Published-norm standard deviation value. Cognitive deterioration will be defined as a decline of at least 1 SD in score from baseline. FACT-BR scores will be transformed to a 0- to 100- point scale. A 10-point decrease will be considered clinically significant. Deterioration in functional independence will be defined as a decline of at least 10% in the Barthel ADL index from baseline.
The proportions of patients with cognitive deterioration, QoL deterioration and functional independence deterioration will be compared between treatment arms using Fisher’s exact test. A sensitivity analysis will be conducted assuming patients who had not completed the neurocognitive assessment or had passed away prior to the assessment time-point, had cognitive deterioration. Change from baseline values will be compared using 2-sample t-tests and repeated measures linear regression, adjusting for the stratification variable (number of brain metastases).
All analyses will use a 2-sided 0.05 level of significance. There will be no adjustment for multiple comparisons.
There is no planned interim analysis for this study.
There is no independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee for this study. Any ≥Grade 3 serious adverse events must be reviewed by the co-investigators to determine if this toxicity is treatment related. All serious treatment related toxicities must be reported to the institutional review board (IRB). If any ≥Grade 4 toxicities are noted, the study will stop for review of safety before continuation, cessation or amendment of trial.
The principal investigator and co-investigators will be responsible for monitoring patient recruitment, toxicities, observed results and the evaluation of data quality. This will be done every 3 months.
This study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and that are consistent with the Good Clinical Practice and the applicable regulatory requirements.
The Clinical Trial Protocol, including the Participant Information Sheet and Consent Form, has been approved by the SingHealth Centralised Institutional Review Board No. 2019/2407 prior to enrolment of any patient into the study.
Only the study team radiation oncology investigators will be allowed to take inform consent from potential trial participants.
Only the Principal investigator and study coordinators will have access to the research data. At the completion of the study, participant identifiers will be removed from stored data and anonymized. Re-identification of participants will be kept by a 3rd party person not involved in the study project. The participants’ name will not be used in any public report of the study.
The optimal management of patients with multiple brain metastases is multifaceted and depends on several factors including tumour type, volume and number of brain metastases, available brain penetrating drugs, prognosis and performance status. Traditionally, the treatment was limited to WBRT. Fortunately, improvements in technology and pharmacology have expanded the therapeutic options for these patients.
SRS which is often given in preference over WBRT in limited brain metastases (≤3–4 lesions) has shown better learning and memory preservation in several randomised trials [
The NRG-CC001 trial which proved the benefit of HA-WBRT over WBRT had a poor intracranial PFS of 5.0 months [
The first patient was recruited on June 2020. The trial is currently ongoing and recruiting patients. The trial is registered on

It is widely acknowledged that HPV prophylactic vaccine could prevent new infections and their associated lesions among women who are predominantly HPV-naive at vaccination. Yet there still remains uncertainty about whether HPV vaccination could benefit to individuals who have undergone surgery for cervical disease.
This post-hoc analysis intends to focus on intent-to-treat participants who underwent excision treatment at baseline and the follow-up period in a phase II/III, double-blind, randomized trial (

No significant evidence from this study showed that HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine could lead to viral faster clearance or have any effect on the rates of persistent infection among women who had excision treatment. However, the vaccine may still benefit post-treatment women with “primary prophylactic” effect. Further research is required in clarifying the effect of using the prophylactic HPV vaccine as therapeutic agents.

Persistent high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection is necessary for the progression of cervical cancer [
Women after treatment for CIN remain at a substantially increased risk of subsequent cervical cancer [
However, few studies evaluate whether the observed effects arise from: (1) “therapeutic effect” of the prophylactic vaccination in leading to faster clearance of the residual infection; or (2) “primary prophylactic” effect of the vaccination on the newly developed lesions caused by new HPV infections after treatment; or (3) “secondary prophylactic” effect of the vaccination in reducing the ability of the residual virus to infect new cells. In this study, we explore the role of a bivalent vaccine in preventing secondary lesions and provide more scientific evidence for the impact of the vaccine on the women who are treated for cervical disease.
Women included in the present evaluation were the participants who underwent excision treatment at baseline and the follow-up period in a phase II/III, double-blind, randomized trial conducted in Jiangsu province (Binhai, Jintan, Lianshui and Xuzhou CDCs), China. In this trial, women aged 18–25 years were randomized (1:1) to receive HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine(
In this post-hoc analysis, we intend to explore the impact of HPV vaccination on women after excision treatment by focusing on intent-to-treat participants who received at least one dose of vaccine or placebo. Three level of analysis would be conducted in focusing on HPV infection (Fig.

Cervical exfoliated cell samples for HPV DNA testing and cytological evaluation were collected at each study visit. Cytological evaluation was performed at the Cancer Institute of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CICAMS). And the results were interpreted according to the Bethesda 2001 classification system [
The automatic analyzer SPF10 PCR-DEIA-LiPA25 version 1 (manufactured by Labo Biomedial Product, Rijswijk, the Netherlands based on licensed Innogenetics technology) detected HPV DNA of cervical, biopsy samples and tissue specimens including 14 high-risk HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68) and 11 low-risk HPV types (6, 11, 34, 40, 42, 43, 44, 53, 54, 70 and 74).
Comparisons of enrollment characteristic, accumulative clearance rate and persistent infection rate between the two groups were conducted by Pearson χ

ASCUS: atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance; ASCH: atypical squamous cell, but cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion; AGC: atypical glandular cells; LSIL: low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion; HSIL: high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion; Inadequate: unsatisfactory cytological results; HPV: human papillomavirus; HR-HPV: high-risk human papillomavirus; LR-HPV: low-risk human papillomavirus
Women who underwent cervical treatment surgery were followed for a median of 50.0 months after treatment (vaccine arm: 49.5, IQR: 32.0–64.0; placebo arm: 50.0, IQR: 30.3–63.5), corresponding to a median of 9 study visits (vaccine arm: 9, IQR: 5–12; placebo arm: 8, IQR: 5–11). The median duration between enrollment and treatment was 17 months for those in the vaccine arm (IQR:4.0–30.0 months) and 17 months for women in the placebo arm (IQR:6.0–34.8 months).

Then, we evaluated whether the viral clearance rates or HPV persistent infection rates differed by vaccination status. Results were shown in Fig.

When LSIL+ was examined as the outcome, nonsignificant but positive vaccine efficacy was estimated at 45.5% (95%CI -15.5, 74.2%) for 14 HR-HPV infection, and 85.1% (95% CI -23.5, 98.2%) for the newly detected outcome after treatment, respectively. Similar patterns were observed for HPV-16/18 infection as well.

This is the first analysis in China to evaluate the efficacy of HPV 16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccination on the relapse of cervical precancerous lesions or cancers among women who underwent excisional procedures for cervical lesions after vaccination. In this study, vaccination failed to lead to viral faster clearance or have any effect on persistent HPV infection. However, the available evidence suggested that the vaccine may still benefit women after excisional treatment for cervical disease by “primary prophylactic” effect, which protects women from new infection after treatment.
Former studies have indicated that the prophylactic HPV vaccines have the possibility in benefiting post-treatment women. The post-hoc analysis of the PApilloma TRIal against Cancer In young Adults (PATRICIA) showed that efficacy of the HPV 16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine post-surgery (60 days or more) for the original lesion was 88.2% against CIN2+ and 42.6% against CIN1+ [
The women who were treated due to HPV-related disease were at high risk for developing subsequent HPV related disease. The persistent or recurrent rate of CIN2+ after excisional treatment was reported as 4% ~ 18% [
The major advantage of our study is that we have detailed information about the margin status of excisional material for each woman treated for the first cervical lesion who subsequently developed lesions after surgery. This made it possible to confirm whether subsequent cervical lesions were associated with HPV genotype infection found in the original lesion. However, there are some limitations in our analysis. The subgroup of women who underwent excision treatment was not a randomized group, so we had limited power to evaluate post-treatment vaccine efficacy. Furthermore, because no any sexual behavior data was collected, we were not able to evaluate the sexual behavior difference between two groups or estimate the effect of vaccination by adjusting the factor. However, a good balance regarding HPV status at enrollment had been achieved between the two arms, which indicated that there may be no significant difference in sexual behavior between the two groups. And we used cytological results as an outcome in the analysis due to not all women after treatment underwent colposcopy, which may have potential bias. Based on previous study [
Significant vaccine efficacy against new infections after treatment for 14 HR-HPV infection was observed. The nonsignificant effect against new infections associated with HPV-16/18 and cervical lesions (LSIL+ and CIN2+) maybe caused by the limited power with smaller number of women. However, the vaccine may still benefit post-treatment women with the “primary prophylactic” effect. Further research is required in clarifying the effect of using the prophylactic HPV vaccine as therapeutic agents.

Interprofessional education in childhood cancer is a multifaceted field involving multiple healthcare professionals with general and specialised knowledge and skills. Complex treatment, care and rehabilitation require continuous professional development and maintenance of healthcare professionals’ competencies in their field of expertise. However, limited knowledge exists in comparing interprofessional and monoprofessional education. Only a few randomised studies have evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of interprofessional education.
The objective of this single-centre, investigator-initiated cluster randomised trial is to study the effect of interprofessional versus monoprofessional case-based learning on healthcare professionals’ knowledge of gastrointestinal side effects and attitudes towards team collaboration.
This study will randomise healthcare professionals to participate in either the experimental interprofessional group or the control monoprofessional group of case-based learning. The topic of the case-based intervention will be gastrointestinal side effects, one of six categories identified in a three-round Scandinavian Delphi study as relevant for interprofessional education in childhood cancer.
The primary outcome is the self-reported questionnaire Assessment of Interprofessional Team Collaboration Scale. Secondary outcomes are measured by the self-reported questionnaires Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale Questionnaire, Safety Attitudes Questionnaire, and knowledge will be evaluated using a multiple-choice quiz.
Participants will receive the self-reported questionnaires about 2 weeks before and 1 month after the intervention. On the day of the intervention, participants will answer a multiple-choice quiz before and after the case-based learning.
Linear mixed models will be used to compare differences between the two groups in mean scores postintervention, adjusting for preintervention scores.
This study will provide insight into the differences between interprofessional and monoprofessional case-based learning and how it affects healthcare professionals’ knowledge of gastrointestinal side effects and attitudes towards team collaboration.

Interprofessional education in childhood cancer is a multifaceted field involving multiple healthcare professionals with general and specific knowledge and skills. Complex treatment, care and rehabilitation require continuous professional development and maintenance of healthcare professionals’ competencies in their field of expertise to provide children and adolescents with cancer and their families the best possible treatment and care [
There has been a shift in the treatment paradigm in childhood cancer from cure towards normality and interprofessional collaboration in childhood cancer research has contributed to this [
To continuously ensure and strengthen high-quality treatment and care, interprofessional education must be strategically planned based on a curriculum involving all relevant healthcare professionals and specific learning outcomes [
In a scoping review, we described a lack of well-structured and evaluated interprofessional education programmes [
In a three-round Scandinavian Delphi study to establish consensus on learning objectives for an interprofessional education programme in childhood cancer [
The learning objectives in the second category: gastrointestinal side effects will inform the case and the multiple-choice quiz that will be applied in this trial (see 
This trial will focus solely on the second category as gastrointestinal side effects are frequent and potentially severe clinical problems in childhood cancer that involve multiple healthcare professionals.
The objective of this trial is to study the effect of interprofessional versus monoprofessional case-based learning (CBL) on healthcare professionals’ knowledge of gastrointestinal side effects and attitudes towards team collaboration.
The hypothesis is that interprofessional case-based learning (ICBL) will improve healthcare professionals’ knowledge of gastrointestinal side effects and attitudes towards team collaboration.
In this randomised controlled trial, the experimental group are interprofessional groups receiving CBL on children and adolescents with cancer and gastrointestinal side effects. The control groups are monoprofessional groups of either nurses or doctors. See Fig. 
Flowchart of the progress of the phases in the randomised controlled trial
This randomised controlled trial will take place at Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen and include eligible healthcare professionals from four departments: inpatient department for children and adolescents with cancer; inpatient department for transplantation of children and adolescents with cancer; and two outpatient departments for children and adolescents with cancer (Fig. 
Occupational background of the participants
Staff managers and staff involved in organising the study will be excluded from the intervention.
Participants will be informed by the principal investigator that they can withdraw their consent and discontinue their participation at any time. If any data has already been obtained, participants will be asked to give permission to include their data.
All eligible healthcare professionals will be informed individually or in groups about the trial (for information material, please contact the corresponding author). Participants will be encouraged by the head of departments to participate in the programme.
The intervention design is based on the CBL literature [
Example of learning objectives for the CBL session
At the core of the case method will be a real patient situation based on anonymised data containing no identifiable traits. The case will be open to interpretation as it is imperative to give as many possible alternative interpretations to what caused the problem and potential solutions (see Table

The intervention consists of three and a half hours of CBL. Table 
Tentative programme for intervention and control session with quiz and evaluation
The research team designing the case represents the two largest professional groups in childhood cancer: doctors and nurses. The facilitators will be supervised and supported by the researchers (MKT, JLS) on how to build an atmosphere conducive to facilitating CBL in an interprofessional setting [
The participants in the experimental group will be randomised into six interprofessional teams. The computer-generated allocation sequence will be designed to ensure an adequate composition of health professionals resembling authentic clinical teams of 10–18 people. For example, four nurses, two doctors, one physiotherapist, one priest, one teacher, one social worker and one pharmacist.
The participants in the control group will be randomised into four monoprofessional groups comprised exclusively of nurses and three groups exclusively of doctors (See Fig. 
Two weeks to one month before the CBL session, the participants will receive an email with a link to the three questionnaires (AITCS, RIPLS and SAQ) generated in the secure web application REDCap [
Timepoints of measurements
An MCQ will test the participants’ knowledge before and after the CBL (see an example of MCQ item in Table 
Example from MCQ and example from course evaluation
The case and the multiple-choice quiz will be pilot tested on a group of healthcare professionals that resemble the interprofessional group. The facilitators of the CBL will be two doctors and two nurses who work with education, supervision and introduction of experienced new staff from the paediatric oncology department. The multiple-choice quiz will be face- and content validated [
The participants will be asked whether they participated in any other childhood cancer CBL interventions between enrolment in the trial and answering the final questionnaires.
For exploratory analysis, the CBL sessions will be audio-recorded, and field notes will be taken focusing on the perceived dynamics and interactions in the room [
For primary and secondary outcomes, we will use self-reported questionnaires, using a five-point Likert Scale. All scales are professionally translated and validated for a Danish context [
Assessment of Interprofessional Team Collaboration Scale (AITCS) is a self-reported assessment of team collaboration for healthcare professionals [
Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) is a self-reported assessment of readiness of interprofessional learning [
Also, a secondary outcome, Safety and Attitude Questionnaire (SAQ) is a self-reported assessment of attitude towards patient safety with 60 items to be rated on a 5-point Likert scale, 5 = Agree strongly, 4 = Agree slightly, 3 = Neutral, 2 = Disagree slightly, 1 = Disagree strongly). Items two and 11 are negatively worded [
The final secondary outcome is difference in knowledge evaluated using MCQ; evaluation of participants’ attitudes about the CBL sessions; qualitative content analysis on interactions between healthcare professionals during the CBL sessions.
This study is ongoing with recruitment starting in September 2019; intervention begins on February 25th to April 1st, 2020. Data collection ends approximately August 2020.

Data on the effectiveness of interprofessional education for making the sample size calculation are sparse [
We assume that the primary outcome will be normally distributed with a standard deviation of 20 points [
Observations on participants on the same team will be correlated [
Design effect =1 + (cluster size – 1) x ICC → design effect =1.6. Accordingly, the sample size will be 45 × 1.6 = 72 participants in each arm. With at least 80 participants in each group, there is room for up to 10% missingness.
Blinded randomisation to ICBL (experimental group) and monoprofessional CBL (control group) will be performed centrally by a computer algorithm. To ensure representation of the smaller professional groups in the experimental groups, they will be randomised separately, before randomising the nurses and doctors. MKTOP and JN will generate the allocation sequence that allocates participants to the sessions by the computer algorithm. MKTOP will subsequently contact and enrols participants, and assign them to the session they were randomly selected to participate in. The healthcare professionals, the educators providing the educational intervention, and the researchers analysing the recordings will not be blinded to the intervention. The allocated intervention group will be blinded for the data managers and statisticians.
We only expect a small number of missing observations (due to illness, rescheduling, absences) and will assume that these will be missing at random, [
For all outcomes, the group means in the experimental and the control group postintervention will be compared, adjusting for the preintervention scores using a linear mixed model that includes the postintervention as outcomes, assuming the group means at baseline to be equal due to randomisation (a constrained linear mixed model [
Each participant will be registered with an individual trial number known only to the PhD student designing the trial. The study is blinded to all other investigators and management. Participant attendance in the CBL session and completion of their questionnaires will be kept track of. Data on demography and results from questionnaires will be stored in REDCap. The MCQ hardcopies will be archived under the same unique trial number and stored in a locked cabinet at Rigshospitalet.
The trial will be monitored internally only.
Participants will be exclusively healthcare professionals or professionals trained to work with children and adolescents with cancer. No patients will be involved in the trial.
There is no anticipation of harm or risk; however, some potential stress, such as fear of exposing one’s own lack of knowledge to colleagues may occur. The departments involved in the trial have a well-established system to provide psychological help to staff involved in emergencies, and this system can be activated if trial participants unexpectedly require psychological support.
The trial will comply with the General Data Protection Regulation. Relevant approval by the Danish Data Protection Agency has been obtained. The trial is exempt from approval by the National Committee on Health Ethics Research (
Participants will be assured that their personal data, data on questionnaires and audio recordings will remain anonymous during analysis and reporting. The participants will be asked to respect the confidentiality of their observations about colleagues’ participation in the CBL session.
The study will adhere to the International Committee of Medical Journal Editor’s guidelines on authorship.

To our knowledge, this is the first randomised trial investigating the effect of interprofessional versus monoprofessional CBL on healthcare professionals’ interprofessional attitudes.
This study will provide insight into the differences between interprofessional and monoprofessional CBL and how it affects the healthcare professionals’ interprofessional collaboration and attitudes. Moreover, this study will contribute data on teaching methods for interprofessional teamwork skills, as the evidence in this area is sparse [
A potential limitation of this trial is that it is a single-centre trial that includes only a moderate number of participants. There is a risk of contamination among participants as some of the healthcare professionals work together and can influence each other across randomised groups. At the CBL session, participants will be told not to speak about the intervention with their colleagues as doing so may interfere with the trial results.
Another limitation is that there are no clinical outcomes such as decreased scores of gastrointestinal side effects because the primary outcome is a test of healthcare professionals’ attitudes. Provision of knowledge does not necessarily result in practice change [
Interventions directed at the behaviour of healthcare professionals are categorised as complex because they consist of various interconnecting components [

Triple negative breast cancer affects 10% to 20% of all women diagnosed with breast cancer. Due to its characteristics, treatment strategies are limited and metastatic recurrences are common in the first 5 years after treatment. However, not all patients affected by this disease develop metastases. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes have shown to be reliable predictive biomarkers of treatment response and metastatic recurrences. However, we need to develop simpler and faster ways to predict response to cytotoxic treatment and the possibility of eventual cancer relapse by identifying new biomarkers. Recently, new studies are emerging, suggesting a predictive role of circulating blood cells in different types of cancer. In this study, we will assess the correlation between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and different elements of the blood count in patients diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer.
The main objective of this study is to evaluate the correlation between the peripheral neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and the amount of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, assessed in triple negative breast cancer patients at diagnosis. Secondary objectives include evaluation of the correlation between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes at diagnosis and the baseline absolute neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet counts, as well as the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio. The triple negative breast cancer patients will be enrolled in the PERCEPTION trial during the first year after the treatment completion. Two supplementary blood tests, at 12 months after the end of treatment and at the time of the first metastatic recurrence, will be performed.
The discovery of new prognostic and predictive biomarkers is crucial for triple negative breast cancer. We set up the PERCEPTION clinical trial in order to evaluate certain blood counts as early biomarkers and to assess their correlation with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Demonstration of comparative predictive and/or prognostic capacities of peripheral blood counts and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes would allow introduction of the former as simple and cheap biomarkers in triple negative breast cancer patient management.
The PERCEPTION study has been registered in the French National Agency of Medical Security registry on the 2nd of July 2019 under the number 2019-A01861-56 and in the ClinicalTrials.org registry under the number NCT04068623.
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents 10% to 20% of all breast cancers. Treatment strategies for this type of breast cancer are limited, due to the lack of hormone receptor expression (oestrogen receptors and progesterone receptors) and the absence of amplification for the gene coding for the Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) protein, in tumor cells.
Several studies have demonstrated that higher amounts of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the biopsy before treatment are associated with higher rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT).
The assessment of TIL quantity in a cancer tissue specimen is a semi-quantitative method, which is still not in routine use due to the need for a highly skilled pathologist to perform it, and, also, due to certain level of the inherent error risk. Therefore, reliable quantitative biomarkers that are easy to measure and that could provide additional information to that of TILs or even replace them in predicting treatment response and disease relapse are still lacking.
Various blood cell counts and the ratios between them, such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) could be used as predictive biomarkers in several types of cancer, including breast cancer.
Besides the full blood count, several studies have shown a correlation between the presence of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood and treatment response or even metastatic recurrence.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the correlation between the absolute counts of blood neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets, as well as the NLR and PLR, and the amount of TILs assessed on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained breast tumor tissue sampled before treatment for women with TNBC. Evaluation of this correlation might provide important information whether peripheral blood counts and their ratios could replace TILs in the prediction of TNBC treatment response and metastatic recurrence. Another aim of this study is to assess ctDNA as a biomarker of metastatic cancer recurrence.
The primary objective of the PERCEPTION study is to evaluate the correlation between the amount of TILs found in the biopsy, measured semi-quantitatively as the percentage of tumor stromal area occupied by lymphocytes
Secondary objectives of the present study include:
Assessment of the correlation between the amount of TILs in the biopsy and the total white blood cell count (WBC), ANC, ALC, absolute platelet count (APC), and PLR routinely assessed in women with TNBC, at diagnosis.
Assessment of the correlation between the mentioned blood counts and their ratios (NLR and PLR), at the time of diagnosis, and the response to NACT according to Sataloff.
Assessment of the correlation between the mentioned blood counts and their ratios (NLR and PLR) at the time of diagnosis, and the TIL amount in the post-NACT surgical specimen.
Assessment of the correlation between the mentioned blood counts and their ratios (NLR and PLR) and the recurrence-free survival (RFS).
Assessment of the correlation between the mentioned blood counts and their ratios (NLR and PLR) before post-NACT surgery and TIL quantity in the surgical specimen post-NACT, depending on the time between surgery and the last administration of chemotherapy.
Assessment of the correlation between the mentioned blood counts and their ratios (NLR and PLR) and the presence of ctDNA.
Assessment of the correlation between ctDNA and RFS.
Assessment of the correlation between the mentioned blood counts and their ratios (NLR and PLR) after cancer treatment and the RFS.
The secondary endpoints include the following:
The absolute values of total white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets measured in number of cells × 10
The values of total white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets, NLR, and PLR before post-NACT surgery.
TIL amount in the biopsy before cancer treatment.
TIL amount in the surgical specimen post-NACT.
Response to NACT according to the Sataloff classification.
The period of time between surgery and the last administration of chemotherapy.
The amount of ctDNA.
Metastatic recurrence.
The participants should meet the inclusion criteria in order to be enrolled in the study (see Table 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria of the PERCEPTION trial.
Patient may exit study prematurely following:
Patient decision
Investigator decision
Patient death
Patient lost to follow-up
Eligible patients will be selected out of a local database of TNBC patients and will be recruited during the first year following the end of RT. The data collected before inclusion, such as TILs evaluation at baseline and in the surgical specimen, as well as blood test results at different times (baseline, before surgery, before the start of RT, and 6 months after the end of RT) will also be analyzed. After inclusion in the PERCEPTION trial, patients will undergo 2 interventions. A blood test will be performed 12 months after the end of RT and another blood test will be performed at the time of the first metastatic recurrence, if applicable. WBC, ANC, ALC, APC, NLR, PLR, and ctDNA will be measured from these blood tests. The overall follow-up is 5 years (see Fig. 
Timeline of the patients’ treatment and follow-up. CT = chemotherapy, NACT = neoadjuvant chemotherapy, RT = radiation therapy. Patients are included in the trial 1 year after the end of radiation therapy, as indicated by the blue arrow.
Recruitment will be carried out in the Jean Perrin Centre by an oncologist. After checking the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the study will be thoroughly explained to the patient by the oncologist, and a consent form will be signed by both.
The recruitment period will last 3 years, from October 2019 to October 2022; 90 patients are expected to be included. After enrolment completion, the primary objective will be analyzed. The overall follow-up for each patient is 5 years, if no metastatic recurrences occur.
Most of the data will be available and will have been collected at the time of enrolment:
Demographic data (age)
Initial diagnosis of TNBC (date of diagnosis, histological characteristics of the tumor, hormone receptor and HER2 expression, TNM classification)
Cancer treatment and response to the treatment
Clinical characteristics of the tumor in the surgical specimen
Blood test results at the time of diagnosis, before surgery, before the onset of RT, and 6 months post-RT
TIL amount in the biopsy and in the surgical specimen
After patient enrolment, blood test results at 12 months post-RT and at the time of the first metastatic recurrence will be collected.
A comparison of the demographic and recurrence data of the recruited patients to those of eligible patients but not included in the study will be performed, to show that the studied population in this trial is no different from the general population of non-metastatic TNBC patients.
The assessment of TIL quantity will be independently performed by 2 breast pathologists. In case of the initial result discordance, the slides will be reviewed by both pathologists under a multi-headed microscope and the consensus will be reached after a concertation.
Tumor DNA mutations will be identified from tumor samples. Then, DNA will be extracted from the blood plasma and will be amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in order to select the DNA region carrying the mutation identified in the tumor sample and to measure the quantity of circulating tumor DNA.
Data will be collected and entered in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) by a Clinical Research Associate (CRA) in charge of the study, under the responsibility of the principal investigator.
Data collected and transmitted to the promoter by the investigators will be anonymized. Study data will not contain any names or other personal identifiers such as addresses. Patients included in the trial will be identified by a code specific to this trial. The investigator will have access to the correspondence table between the patient's last name, first name, date of birth, and the code assigned in the trial.
Given the scarcity of data in the literature concerning the correlation between TILs and NLR, our goal is to recruit as many patients as possible. A sample size of 90 patients would allow us to show an average effect size of 0.3 (with a 0.8 power and a 0.05 alpha risk). According to preliminary studies (not published), the variables present enough variability to allow for the detection of a correlation.
Statistical analysis will be performed with R software (v3.6 or newer, R-Project, GNU GPL, 
Normality of continuous variables will be investigated and we will perform a description of the dependencies of the pairs of variables, where relevant. For hypothesis testing, alpha risk will be set at the conventional 5%, 
In order to study the dependency relationship between NLR and TILs, we will perform a correlation analysis between these 2 continuous variables (graphical analysis, Spearman correlation coefficient, significance test, confidence interval).
The relationship between the other blood counts and the TILs at different times will be assessed through a correlation analysis as for the main objective.
The relationship between the absolute blood counts and the derived ratios (NLR, PLR), and the response to NACT will be evaluated by analyses of variance (or Kruskal–Wallis tests) and logistic regressions. A subgroup analysis will be performed based on the length of the period between the last cycle of NACT and surgery. A mixed model will also be considered to account for repeated measures and the time lag between the end of NACT and surgery.
The relationship between the presence of ctDNA after the end of treatment and the relapse of TNBC will be analyzed by Fisher's exact test. Patients treated with NACT and first-line surgery will be analyzed separately.
The elements of blood will be assessed as early markers of TNBC relapse using logistic regressions, possibly penalized (the LASSO method). Patients treated with NACT and first-line surgery will be analyzed separately.
A CRA mandated by the promoter will ensure the proper conduct of the study, data collection, documentation, recording, and report, in accordance with the good clinical practices guidelines and the legal provisions in force.
The respect of the study protocol and procedures therein, and the quality of the collected data (accuracy, missing data, consistency with the source documents) will be regularly reviewed; monitoring reports will ensure traceability.
Changes to the protocol will be qualified as substantial or not. Depending on their nature, they will be the subject of a new review by the French ethical research committee and/or an authorization from the competent authority.
Identifying new biomarkers that would allow for a quick, inexpensive, and reliable prediction of treatment response and metastatic recurrence of TNBC patients is still an important unsatisfied medical need. Such biomarkers would allow oncologists to propose alternative treatment and enrolment into clinical trials to the TNBC patients carrying a high risk of resistance to the classical NACT or/and a high risk of metastatic recurrence.
The PERCEPTION clinical trial is designed to verify whether a peripheral blood count or a ratio of peripheral blood counts can provide similar prognostic information as TILs. However, this clinical trial has certain drawbacks. First of all, since it is conducted at a single site, the sample size will be relatively limited. Furthermore, this study will only assess the full blood count and ctDNA as predictors of relapse. Studying other elements, such as circulating proteins would be of great interest in the prediction of TNBC relapse.
In conclusion, the PERCEPTION trial will give us important information about the correlation between NLR and TILs before treatment in TNBC patients and at other time periods. It will allow us to determine if we can further explore the values of blood cells as predictive markers in TNBC, and propose further studies, assessing new biomarkers that could be of great value in the treatment of TNBC.
As of this day 18 patients have been recruited in the PERCEPTION trial. Recruitment began on 4th of December 2019 and is ongoing, according to version 14 of the protocol of 9th October 2019. Recruitment is expected to be completed in October 2022.

The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoid infusion pulse therapy to improve the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with elevated inflammatory biomarkers.
A parallel-group quadruple-blind (participant, intervention provider, outcome assessor and data manager), randomised controlled trial.
All patients admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 pneumonia will be considered eligible. Potential candidates will be identified and consecutively included in the emergency room or in the COVID-19 admission wards of two hospitals in Spain: Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra (Pamplona) and Hospital Moisès Broggi (Sant Joan Despí, Barcelona).
Inclusion criteria are: 1) age ≥18 years old; 2) diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum in accordance with the recommendations of the Spanish Ministry of Health; 3) history of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 ≥7 days; 4) hospital admission; 5) at least one of the following: C-reactive protein (CRP) >60 mg/dL, interleukin-6 (IL-6) >40 pg/mL, and/or ferritin >1000 μg/L; and 6) provision of informed consent.
Exclusion criteria are: 1) allergy or contraindication to any of the drugs under study; 2) oxygen saturation (SpO
Eligible patients will be randomised to receive standard of care plus methylprednisolone (intervention group) or standard of care plus placebo (control group).

Intervention group: standard of care at the discretion of the researcher, including lopinavir/ritonavir (200/50 mg, 2 tablets twice daily, per os, for 7 to 14 days) ± remdesivir (a single intravenous loading dose of 200 mg on day 1 followed by once-daily intravenous maintenance doses of 100 mg from day 2 to 5), or no drug treatment, + methylprednisolone (once-daily intravenous infusion of 120 mg on days 1, 2 and 3).
Control group: standard of care at the discretion of the researcher, including lopinavir/ritonavir (200/50 mg, 2 tablets every 12 hours, per os, for 7 to 14 days) ± remdesivir (a single intravenous loading dose of 200 mg on day 1 followed by once-daily intravenous maintenance doses of 100 mg from day 2 to 5), or no drug treatment, + placebo (once-daily intravenous infusion of 100 mL of 0.9% saline on days 1, 2 and 3).
The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with treatment failure at 14 days after randomisation, defined as: 1) death, 2) need for admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), 3) initiation of mechanical ventilation, 4) SpO
Treatment will be allocated by block randomisation stratified by patient age (< or ≥ 75 years of age). For this purpose, we will use the R randomizeR package using two block sizes (4 and 6) with random permutation. The randomisation sequence will be generated by a unit (the Navarrabiomed Clinical Trials Platform) independent from the researchers who will recruit patients and implement the protocol.
The study will be quadruple-blinded, specifically, with blinding of patients, intervention providers, outcome assessors and data managers. The pharmacy at each participating hospital will prepare indistinguishable bags of methylprednisolone or placebo (0.9% saline) for patients of the experimental and placebo groups, respectively.
The percentage of patients with treatment failure (primary endpoint) is currently unknown. Assuming an absolute difference of 25% in the primary outcome between the two groups (35% in the control group and 10% in the intervention group), we estimate that 60 patients (30 per group) are required to detect this difference with a two-tailed type I error of 0.05 and a type II error of 0.2. Estimating a loss to follow-up of 20%, we should recruit a total sample size of 72 patients (36 per group).

Previous studies suggest that health intervention designed to increase cervical cancer screening has been effective to reduce cervical cancer incidence and mortality. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of a home-based health education intervention for increasing cervical cancer screening uptake delivered by trained female community health volunteers (FCHVs), a category of community health worker in Nepal.
A community-based, open-label, two-armed, cluster-randomized trial [seven clusters (geographical wards) randomized for the intervention, and seven for the control arm]. The participants are recruited from a population-based survey with a sample size of 884. Based on population proportion size, 277 women will be recruited for the intervention group and 413 women recruited for the control group. A 12-month community-based health education intervention will be administered mobilizing the FCHVs, based on the Health Belief Model. The primary outcome measure of the study will be the difference in percentage of cervical cancer screening uptake between the two study arms. The primary outcomes will be modeled by using mixed-effect logistic regression analysis.
COBIN-C is the first study investigating the effect of a community-based health education intervention by FCHVs on increasing cervical cancer screening uptake among women in Nepal. The purpose of this study is to develop and implement a home-based, culturally sensitive program to increase cervical cancer screening coverage at the community level.

Cervical cancer is a common cancer among women in most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in Asia, Africa, and Latin America [
Studies suggest that mobilizing lay health workers and empowering them with integrated training could contribute in expansion of the knowledge base on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) at the community level and harmonize the community-based interventions [
Mobilizing FCHVs to educate women and encourage them to participate in cervical cancer screening, and thus strengthening grass root level primary health provision, could be an acceptable and culturally appropriate intervention, which needs to be tested. Furthermore, it may contribute in the implementation of the National Cervical Cancer Screening and Prevention policy and ultimately help to reduce cervical cancer mortality in Nepal. The health promotion package will be a simple, feasible and effective approach.
In our study, we will conduct a community based cluster-randomized controlled trial (cRCT) to explore the roles of FCHVs in educating and empowering women through home visits to increase the uptake of VIA screening. Therefore, the primary outcome of the study is to increase the cervical cancer-screening uptake in the study area.
This manuscript adheres to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 statement: extension to cRCT [
The proposed trial is a community-based, 12-month, open label, two-arm cRCT with an equal allocation of clusters (geographical wards) between intervention and control arms in a semi-urban area of Pokhara Metropolitan city (former Lekhnath municipality, administratively divided in to 15 wards). It is one of the two areas where the Cervical Cancer Screening and Prevention (CCSP) pilot program was first initiated in Nepal. The total population of Lekhnath municipality is 59,498 (female 32,104 and male 27,394) with the total number of households being 14,958 as per the 2011 census [
The populations targeted in our study area are women aged 30–60 years (the age range recommended for VIA screening in Nepal), listed in the Community-Based Intervention for Non-communicable diseases study for hypertension (COBIN-H) [
Planned flow chart of participants
A sampling framework was adopted from the COBIN-H trial that has taken a population framework of all eligible participants from the voter list prepared by the Election Commission in 2017 [
Clusters will be randomly assigned to intervention and control areas using a 1:1 allocation ratio. Randomization will be done before the participants are recruited. Research teams responsible for identifying potential participants, obtaining consent, and recruiting trial participants will be blinded to the participants’ allocation status. The following steps will be taken to avoid selection bias during random allocation: (a) clusters will be randomized only after the baseline survey, (b) clusters will not be withdrawn from or added to the study, and (c) a statistician from abroad who is not familiar to the study will randomize the clusters.
Women aged 30–60 years who are listed in COBIN-H and who indicated they planned to reside in a cluster in the study area for at least the next 12 months are eligible for inclusion in the baseline survey and for the invitation to participate in the study. Women who are severely ill, pregnant, less than 6 weeks after delivery, who are already diagnosed with cervical pre-cancer and cancer, with a history of total hysterectomy, as well as those who decline to participate in the study or unable to complete the interview, will be excluded from the study.
The primary outcome of the study is percentage change in cervical cancer screening uptake from baseline to follow-up in the intervention group compared to the control group in a 12-month home-based health education intervention. The baseline survey will be conducted before the cluster randomization, and a follow-up survey of similar method will be conducted after 12-month intervention. The response of each participant for cervical cancer screening in the baseline survey and the follow-up survey will be compared to evaluate the percentage. In addition, FCHV will provide a referral slip to the participants in the intervention group (keeping a copy of the referral slip to submit to the field supervisor) during the home visit, which they take with them and submit to the health facility for VIA screening. The referral slip contains study code, name, age, address, and signature of both FCHV and the participant. FCHV will inform the participants about the health facility where the services are freely available. The key health personnel providing the VIA screening services are oriented about the study. Furthermore, confidentiality about the participants’ information will be maintained throughout the intervention. The field supervisor will collect the referral slip to confirm that the participants have received VIA screening and results from all the health facilities of the intervention ward as a reference to the participants’ response.
The secondary outcomes of the study are change in the level of knowledge and awareness among women on cervical cancer screening and prevention. The response of each participant for knowledge and awareness on cervical cancer screening in the baseline survey and the follow-up survey will be compared to evaluate the change using the validated questionnaire [
The sample size for the baseline survey is calculated based on the method suggested by the WHO STEPWISE Approach [
After randomization, the FCHVs in intervention wards will receive training coordinated by the research team in collaboration and close supervision of the local health authority. The training manual is designed under the guidance of experts in cervical cancer and public health from the national and international organizations. The training manual is based on the following: training of community health workers, WHO, 2017 training manual [

Communication with the health facility
At the end of the training, FCHVs will assign the number of households that have to be visited based on the baseline survey. Participants in the intervention clusters will receive a 12-month, home-based, health education package administered by FCHVs in a household setting. FCHVs will visit each household, meet the selected participant, receive approval, and provide the health education. On average, one FCHV will meet 18 participants three times a year. FCHV will complete the three visits to provide health education even if the participants have already received VIA screening. During the visit, FCHVs will deliver the health education intervention, to encourage and empower women for cervical cancer screening uptake available free of cost at their local health facility. They will also conduct two reinforcement visits every 4 months from the first visit (three home visits in a year).
Health workers conducting cervical cancer screening at the local health facility in the intervention group will receive orientation about the study to make sure that the women attending the health facility receive screening. They will ensure that the equipment is functional and reagents are available, record information, provide psychosocial counseling to the case positives, and refer for further confirmation and treatment. The recorded information at the health facility will be tallied using the referral slip to confirm women’s participation for cervical cancer screening. The collected data will be kept strictly confidential and will only be accessed by the members of the trial team.
Each participant is assigned an individual trial identification number, which is securely stored. The principal investigator reserves the right to the data set and could share upon reasonable request.
There will be no special criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions. Furthermore, the implementing community-based intervention for cervical cancer screening uptake will not require alteration to usual care pathways (including use of any medication) and will continue for both the trial arms.
A field supervisor will routinely visit each FCHV in order to maintain motivation and collection of records from the health facilities. The supervisor also provides ad hoc help to the FCHVs when needed during the intervention period. We will also use a supervision checklist to track and update the knowledge and skill levels of FCHVs as well as to ensure fidelity to the study protocol.
In the control clusters, participants will receive “usual care.” The usual care means the current health education and promotion practices for cervical cancer screening at the community level provided by the government health system. They will not receive further contact, information, or educational materials from FCHVs until the 12-month assessment.
The risk and level of contamination will be monitored at the levels of FCHVs and participants. FCHVs will be instructed not to share information about the study and not to provide any support to people from other clusters in the community, other than the ones who are assigned. The risk of contamination will also be minimized by the cluster design, whereby the intervention and control clusters will be geographically separated and the chance of intervention cluster participants regularly meeting control cluster participants will be negligible. All possible means of contamination between intervention and control participants will be collected during the follow-up survey and adjustments will be made for estimating the effect.
The intervention is designed under the guidance of experts in cervical cancer and public health from the national and international organizations. The subject experts and major stakeholders reviewed and validated the training materials. The education session were delivered under the close supervision of the local level health authority and the research team, who will monitor the intervention. The Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) along with a member from the Nepal Health Research Council will evaluate the progress of the trial, including periodic assessments of data quality and timeliness, participant recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, performance of the trial site, and other factors that can affect study outcome. Each FCHV in the intervention cluster will be advised of the importance of following the intervention steps and content during the training session. The field supervisor will monitor FCHVs tasks. FCHVs will deliver the services guided by a register that keeps them reminded of stages of the intervention and will report every 4 months.
STATA version 15 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) will be used for quantitative analysis following the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines for cluster-randomized trials. Flowcharts (Fig. 
There is no plan for interim analysis, as we do not expect a situation that would lead us to stop the study. However, in the event of an extreme situation such as a natural disaster, a conflict, or duplication of similar interventions in our control area, we will temporarily stop the study to assess the implications on the study design.
We have a robust mechanism to ensure data quality. At first, the data enumerators will receive intensive training on the process of data collection. The principal investigator will monitor the data enumerators on a day-to-day basis. The research assistant assigned for data entry will inspect the data manually and enter the data in EpiData software file (EpiData Association, Odense, Denmark). Double entry for 10% of the data will qualify potential errors in data entry quality. The research officer will crosscheck the data quality on the spot and in our field office for any incomplete, inconsistent, and invalid data. Any deviation in the data quality will require recollecting in the field.
The study carries minimal risk to the study participants, which is why we have no compensation or insurance plan for the participants. However, we will provide medical insurance and US$5 per home visit to FCHVs for transportation expenses.
The results of the trial will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.
The COBIN-C study is the first investigation of a community-based intervention to increase cervical cancer screening uptake in Nepal. We expect that a community-based, culturally tailored education intervention delivered by community health workers such as FCHVs will play a key role in increasing cervical cancer screening uptake in the study area. Indeed, community health workers can play an important role in understanding the cultural barriers including community health practices, cultural identity, and coping practices that can promote positive health outcomes [
Furthermore, studies from Iran, Kenya, and Nigeria have reported health education interventions and behavior change frameworks provide an effective base for cervical cancer prevention [
The health promotion package is a simple, feasible, and potentially effective approach. It may contribute in the implementation of the National Cervical Cancer Screening and Prevention policy and help reduce cervical cancer mortality in the long term in Nepal and if successful may be adapted to similar settings elsewhere.
The trial is now closed to participant accrual, but the trial is ongoing. The endpoint assessment of all the participants will be completed by the end of August 2021. The schedule of enrollment, interventions, and assessments is presented in Table

In current medical practice of curative treatment for non-metastatic oesophageal cancer, surgery on principle is carried out by oesophagectomy after neoadjuvant treatment. However, oesophagectomy is often associated with postoperative morbidity and mortality. Taking into account that modern neoadjuvant therapy is effective and many of patients show no vital tumour cells in the operative specimens, we aim to perform a scoping review as part of the development phase for a prospectively planned multicentre randomised controlled trial investigating ‘surgery as needed vs surgery on principle in patients with postneoadjuvant complete response of oesophageal cancer’ (Prospective trial registration number DRKS00022801). This scoping approach will allow us to finally define and/or adapt the research question including the design and methodology of the randomised controlled trial taking into account the findings for example, research gaps and/or pitfalls in the currently available study pool addressing this or very similar questions.
To identify relevant research, we will conduct searches in the electronic databases Medline, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Library and Science Direct. We will also check references of relevant studies and perform a cited reference research (forward citation tracking). Titles and abstracts of the records identified by the searches will be screened and full texts of all potentially relevant articles will be obtained. We will consider randomised trials and non-randomised controlled studies. Data extraction tables will be set up, including study and patients’ characteristics, aim of study and reported outcomes. We will summarise the data using tables and figures (eg, bubble plots) to present the research landscape and to describe potential clusters and/or gaps to support the planning of a randomised trial in this patient population.
Ethical approval is not required for this scoping review. Study findings will be shared by publication in a peer-reviewed journal and by presentation to key stakeholders on scientific meetings.
The scoping review is part of the development phase for a prospectively planned multicentre randomised trial, addressing ‘Surgery as needed versus surgery on principle in patients with post-neoadjuvant complete response of oesophageal cancer’ (Prospective trial registration number DRKS00022801).
The scoping review will allow us to finally define and/or adapt the research question, the design and methodology of the following randomised trial.
The scoping review protocol is guided by validated methodological frameworks and the scoping review will be reported according to the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis statement for scoping reviews, and therefore, will be conducted in line with ‘the state-of-the-art’ criteria.
We will conduct comprehensive literature searches and map the current ongoing and published studies by extracting and cluster key data such as neoadjuvant treatment protocols, diagnostic methods of response evaluation and surveillance, and therapeutic outcomes.
The final scoping review will be limited to English and German language studies.
Neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCTX) improve patients’ survival in curative treatment of non-metastatic oesophageal cancer and have become the standard of care in Western Europe.
We aim to perform a scoping review as part of the development phase for a prospectively planned multicentre randomised controlled trial, addressing ‘Surgery as needed vs surgery on principle in patients with post-neoadjuvant complete response of oesophageal cancer’ (Prospective registration identifier of the clinical trial will be DRKS00022801. Registration is currently in process and will be completed after we have incoperated the results of the scoping review). The scoping review will allow us to finally define and adapt the research question and methodology of the following randomised trial taking into account the findings (such as research gaps and/or methodological pitfalls) in the currently available pool of primary studies addressing this or very similar questions.
The objectives of the scoping review are as follows:
What specific neoadjuvant protocols of nCRT and nCTX have been studied for surveillance and surgery as needed?
In what populations or settings have these protocols been studied?
Which diagnostic methods have been used for postneoadjuvant tumour staging and surveillance of tumour response?
Which outcomes have been addressed in the clinical studies on surveillance and surgery as needed in oesophageal cancer?
What results were observed with respect to survival rates?
This protocol is written with reference to the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols statement
We will focus on studies including adults with non-metastatic oesophageal cancer (after receiving neoadjuvant treatment). Studies including patients with distant metastases of oesophageal cancer, presence of gastric cancer; and/or participants younger than 18 years of age will be excluded.
We will consider surveillance after neoadjuvant therapy as eligible intervention. Surgery on principle after neoadjuvant therapy will be the comparator treatment.
We will consider all nCTX and nCRT interventions implemented and evaluated in the context of non-metastatic oesophageal cancer.
We will capture any outcomes reported in the eligible study pool. Highly important outcomes are displayed in 
Outcomes (list will be completed depending on outcomes reported in the available study pool)
Overall survival.
Progression-free survival.
Proportion of radical resection margin.
Postoperative complications. (frequency and severity).
Rate and timing of distant dissemination.
Disease recurrence rate.
Randomised controlled trials; non-randomised controlled studies (using strategies of non-random allocation for assigning interventions) and observational studies (with control group) will be eligible for the scoping review. We will not consider single arm studies. Due to a missing control group within this study design. The reason for this exclusion is that studies without a control group provide no reliable data to estimate comparative effectiveness and will, therefore, not be useful for the planned randomised trial. Furthermore, review articles, clinical guidelines and work that has not been peer-reviewed (eg, thesis, editorials, letters, comments) will be excluded.
We will not apply any exclusion criteria regarding study duration and/or the study setting.
The searches for this scoping review will be performed and conducted by following the recommendation of PRESS (Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies)
Systematic searches for relevant published trials will be conducted in the following electronic data sources
Medline, Medline Daily Update, Medline In Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Medline Epub Ahead of Print (via Ovid) (a preliminary search strategy is displayed in

Data from each included study will be extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second. Disagreements will be resolved through discussion until consensus will be reached.
Risk of bias assessment is not part of a scoping review and will not be assessed accordingly.
The methodology of the scoping review may be adapted minimally during the review process itself in terms of eligibility criteria, data extraction and outcome variables.
We will summarise the collected study data using tables and figures (eg, bubble plots) to present the research landscape and to describe potential clusters and/or gaps to support the planning of the proposed randomised trial in this patient population.
Currently in Western Europe the majority of patients with non-metastatic resectable oesophageal cancer are treated with nCTX or nCRT plus consecutive surgery. Despite postneoadjuvant pathological complete response rates between 16% and 49%, surgery is carried out in all patients and independent of the results of post-neoadjuvant response evaluation.
Although the scoping review may not provide effect estimates including an evaluation of the certainty of evidence, it will be of great value to crystallise research questions, and the extent of available evidence by highlighting areas where evidence is lacking. The scoping review will support us to map the existing primary research for potential duplications. Furthermore, it will provide an overview of the (1) characteristics and definitions of patient populations (included in available studies) and settings, (2) details on the interventions (including type of neoadjuvant therapy, time between neoadjuvant therapy and surgery, definition of surveillance), (3) details on the diagnostic methods used for postneoadjuvant tumour staging, (4) definition of complete responders, (5) outcome measures and (6) follow-up times. Hence the scoping process will allow us to systematically develop the concept of the randomised trial based on current knowledge (including pitfalls) in this newly emerging treatment area.
By searching the searching the literature in different databases (ie, behind Medline) and also study registers (eg, ClinicalTrials.gov), all relevant completed but also ongoing studies comparing surveillance with surgery on demand in esophaegeal cancer will be identified. Finally the results of the scoping review will reveal (1) whether the diagnostic methods used and the definition for complete responders were appropriate and homogeneous, (2) whether the included sample sizes were sufficient to draw conclusions on benefits and harms, (3) what interventions were considered (eg, nCRT and/or chemotherapeutic protocols), (4) what outcomes of interest were covered, (5) whether follow-up times were sufficient and (6) whether clinical results across studies are homogeneous. We believe that the planned randomised trial will benefit from this state-of-the art research approach, and therefore, will provide patients, clinicians and other stakeholders with high evidence considering various patient-relevant outcomes when comparing these two treatment approaches.
Furthermore, parallel to the scoping review patient’s values and perspectives towards choice of treatment will be analysed (DRKS00022050) prior to the start of the randomised trial and patient oriented information material for the trial will be developed and provided.
Overall, the final goal will be the development and verification of a protocol to identify patients with pathological complete response (based on reliable diagnostic methods and definitions for complete responders) who would not need to undergo high-risk surgery in the increasing subgroup of postneoadjuvant complete responders. This treatment procedure is expected to reduce morbidity and mortality rates, and increase quality of life. Regarding the socioeconomic impact, omission of oesophagectomy reduces treatment duration, complication rates and time of hospital stay. This results in reduced treatment costs and a faster return to normal life for this patient population.
Formal ethical approval is not required, as primary patient data will not be collected in this scoping review. We plan to publish the full scoping review in a peer-reviewed journal and to present the results at national and international scientific conferences.

Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is an innovative modality based on high precision planning and delivery. Cancer with bone metastases and oligometastases are associated with an intermediate or good prognosis. We assume that prolonged survival rates would be achieved if both the primary tumor and metastases are controlled by local treatment. Our purpose is to demonstrate, via a multicenter randomized phase III trial, that local treatment of metastatic sites with curative intent with SBRT associated of systemic standard of care treatment would improve the progression-free survival in patients with solid tumor (breast, prostate and non-small cell lung cancer) with up to 3 bone-only metastases compared to patients who received systemic standard of care treatment alone.
This is an open-labeled randomized superiority multicenter phase III trial. Patients with up to 3 bone-only metastases will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio.between Arm A (Experimental group): Standard care of treatment & SBRT to all bone metastases, and Arm B (Control group): standard care of treatment.
For patients receiving SBRT, radiotherapy dose and fractionation depends on the site of the bone metastasis and the proximity to critical normal structures. This study aims to accrue a total of 196 patients within 4 years.
The primary endpoint is progression-free survival at 1 year, and secondary endpoints include Bone progression-free survival; Local control; Cancer-specific survival; Overall survival; Toxicity; Quality of life; Pain score analysis, Cost-utility analysis; Cost-effectiveness analysis and Budget impact analysis.
The expected benefit for the patient in the experimental arm is a longer expectancy of life without skeletal recurrence and the discomfort, pain and drastic reduction of mobility and handicap that the lack of local control of bone metastases eventually inflicts.

Cancer with bone metastases compared to other metastatic sites is considered as associated with a better prognosis, particularly for breast and prostate cancer despite a significant impact on the patient’s quality of life and autonomy. Many randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of first-line palliative conventional radiotherapy for painful bone metastases [
Patients with oligometastatic disease have improved survival compared with those with high- volume metastatic disease. While systemic treatment is the standard of care. Stereotactic radiotherapy is a highly accurate technique initially developed for performing the radiosurgery of lesion in patients for whom it was deemed be to difficult to proceed to classical excision surgery. In the context of patients with oligo-metastatic cancer, high doses of radiation in stereotactic conditions can be safely delivered in bone metastases with increased probability of local control. Local control of bone metastasis is similar to than other localizations with a good control of pain [
In combination with curative-intent treatment to the primary tumor and systemic therapy, we hypothesize that an improved local control in the bone genuine de novo synchronous or metachronous oligometastatic disease would be associated with an increased Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS).
Two ancillaries studies are associated:
- Biological ancillary study which search for pre-SBRT and follow-up markers (serum CTX and bone ALP) associated with skeletal-related events and bone progression disease.
- Economic ancillary study.
This is an open-labeled randomized superiority multicentric phase III studyin French academic hospital. Patients will randomized in a 1:1 ratio between (Fig. 
Arm A (experimental group): Standard care of treatment (systemic treatment suitable for primary cancer) and SBRT to the bone metastases.
Arm B (control group): Standard care of treatment (systemic treatment suitable for primary cancer) alone.

The sample size allows 2 stratification factors at randomization: date of metastases (synchronous vs metachronous) and primary tumor site (prostate vs breast vs lung). All patients will be randomized after completion of the primary tumor treatment for synchronous or metachronous metastasis. The randomization will be minimized by the following stratification factors. Minimization aims to ensure treatment arms are balanced with respect to predefined patient factors as well as for the number of patients in each group.
To assess the impact of SBRT on Progression Free Survival in patients with solid tumor with up to bone-only metastases, compare to patients who received standard of care treatment alone.
The primary endpoint is the 1-year PFS. Progression Free Survival PFS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of the first objective progression or death (whatever its cause in the absence of progression). Stereo-OS protocol will allow a specific focus on skeletal metastases and is thus expected to bring a clear-cut assessment of the added benefit of stereotactic radiotherapy on PFS.

Pregnant women or breast feeding mothers,
Hypersensitivity to the active substance (FDG and NaF or F-Choline for prostate cancer) or to any of the excipients
Contraindication to MRI (in case of spinal metastases)
Patients deprived of liberty or placed under the authority of a tutor. Patients with any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial. Patients unable to understand the purpose of the study (language, etc.).
Prior to randomization, a complete history and physical examination is required. Histologically confirmation of malignancy is required, with metastatic disease detected on imaging.
The mechanism of implementing the allocation sequence (stratified randomization) is generated by computer. Clinical research assistant generate the allocation sequence and physician enroll and assign participant to intervention.
Patients must be restaged within 6 weeks before randomization, including brain CT or MRI and CT-TAP. For all patients with a suspicion of spinal bone metastases, a spinal MRI is mandatory.
The patients will also benefit from PET-CT exams before treatment. PET1 F-Choline, NaF and FDG are standard examinations for metastases staging; and PET2 FDG or F-Choline for evaluation. If NaF-PET cannot be done, patients will have a “conventional” biphosphonates SPECT-CT with a tomographic exploration from the vertex to mid-thigh in double or triple field instead.
Patients with prostate cancer are also required to have PSA blood test. A negative pregnancy is required for women of child-bearing age (Table 
Timeline and follow up of the study
None
The present research project will be developed for 48 months, during which specific milestones will be achieved and documented (Table 
In case of SBRT, the acceptable regimens are 35 Gy / 7 fractions / 3 fractions per week or 27 Gy / 3 fractions / 3 fractions per week. An interval of at least 24 h should be kept between two consecutive fractions. Treatment planning and delivery will be performed using dedicated system. Strict quality assurance protocols will be implemented to ensure the accuracy in dose delivery.
All patients in Arm A will undergo planning CT simulation. CT simulation must be performed in the treatment position with adequate immobilization devices and the fiducials must be placed for stereotactic targeting if necessary. The use of intravenous contrast is recommended. Axial reconstructions will be required with slice thickness of around 1 mm. MRI, and PET if needed will be merged with CT simulation at the target volume on the simulation CT.
The Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) corresponds to the tumor volume visible on the simulation CT taking into account the information provided by the clinical examination and the other imaging modalities. (MRI is mandatory for spinal metastasis and experimental arm).
The Clinical Target Volume (CTV) corresponds to the macroscopic spread. Its limits are defined by Cox et al. for spine metastases or by CTV = GTV + 5 mm for the other bones [
The PTV is obtained by adding a margin around the CTV to take into account the set-up uncertainty during radiotherapy delivery with PTV = CTV + 2 mm. This margin can be reduced to 0 mm close to the spinal cord. Depending on the SBRT equipment, the beam aperture can be set to 2–3 mm beyond the CTV to provide adequate dose coverage. This margin can be reduced to 0–1 mm close to the spinal cord.
Prescription must be defined on 80% isodose or higher. At least 90% of the PTV should receive the prescribed dose. A coverage of < 90% of the PTV will be considered as Acceptable Deviation, and coverage of < 80% of the target volume as an unacceptable deviation. At least 90% of the GTV should receive the prescribed dose. A coverage of < 90% of the GTV will be considered as Acceptable Deviation, and coverage of < 80% of the target volume as an unacceptable deviation.
The organs at risk (OAR) of complication include all normal tissues located in the vicinity of the target or in the beams path. Specific dose-volumes constraints, defined by Timmermann, have to be respected to avoid unacceptable toxicity [
OAR Constraints
None
For the others OAR not listed in Table 
In the Control group (without SBRT), palliative radiotherapy on bone metastases is allowed if necessary (pain, fracture, spinal cord compression …).
The acceptable regimens for patients in Arm1 are as follows as per consensus guidelines [
30 Gy / 10 fractions / 5 fractions per week
24 Gy / 6 fractions / 5 fractions per week
20 Gy / 5 fractions / 5 fractions per week
8 Gy / 1 fraction
The organs at risk are not delineated in the control group except for the spinal cord (Table

French ethics committee (CPP Nord-Ouest I) has approved this protocol on October 13th 2016 (reference number: CPP 02/016/2016). The study will be performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and will comply to the International Conference on Harmonization and Good Clinical Practice and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This study funded by grants from French Cancer Institute (Institut National du Cancer, 52, avenue André Morizet, F-92513 Boulogne Billancourt Cedex) though PHRC program (grant number: PHRC-K 2015–149) that has no role in the collection, analysis, interpretation of results or writing of manuscripts. The study has been registered at 
Patient information and informed consent from the patient must be handled in accordance with the French regulation. Prior to the participation of a patient in the trial, this patient will be informed both verbally and in writing about the objectives of the trial, its methods, anticipated benefits and potential risks and the discomfort to which they may be exposed. The informed consent form for study and ancillaries studies, must be personally dated and signed by the patient and investigator.
In order to ensure patient safety and effective treatment delivery, a quality assurance protocol is implemented. Prior to opening the study, each participant centre will have to validate a dummy run by delineate targets and OARs and produce a treatment plan from a benchmark case on Aquilab software. The Quality Assurance committee will evaluate the dummy run. Patient inclusions by a centre will be allowed only after full validation. Afterwards, each participating centre will have to send planning and contouring information for the first included patient for review before the start of the radiotherapy. The QA committee according to the protocol recommendations in terms of delineation, dose constraints and treatment workflow will evaluate this treatment plan. At the end of treatment, each participating centre will have to send final review of the RT data for all included patients in SBRT arm for review. The QA committee, according to the protocol recommendations in terms of delineation, dose constraints and treatment workflow will evaluate the treatment plan for Quality Assurance.
The patients will receive systemic standard of care for the metastases according to current oncological national recommendations and international guidelines.
Patients will be seen at 3 months, 6 months post randomization and then every year for 3 years.
(Table 
Progression-free survival will be measured as time to either progression or death, whichever occurs first. Efficacy Evaluation will be performed at baseline, at 6 months, at 1 year, then subsequently every year until the end of study, using the same imaging method as for baseline (CT scan or MRI or PET if indicated).
Lesion response will be evaluated in this study using the RECIST criteria, PERCIST Criteria and MD Anderson Criteria [
Sample size calculation: 196 patients will be randomized between 2 arms (in a 1:1 ratio). The primary endpoint is the 1-year Progression Free Survival (PFS). In the standard arm, the expected progression-free survival at 1 year is 30% (10% for lung cancer, 50% for breast cancer and 30% for prostatic cancers). In the experimental arm, we anticipate a 20% absolute increase (i.e. 30, 70 and 50%, respectively). According to Freedman’s method, accepting a two-tailed type I error of 5% and an 80% power (type II error of 20%), 178 patients (2 X 89) need to be recruited and 106 events need to be observed for the primary analysis. Assuming a 10% withdrawal rate, a total of 196 patients will need to be included.
Data analysis: All patients will be randomized after completion of the primary tumor treatment for synchronous or metachronous metastasis. The randomization will be stratified by date of metastasis (synchronous vs. metachronous) and primary tumor site (breast vs. non-small cell lung vs. prostate cancer). Statistical analysis will be performed on all the randomized patients, accordingly to the intent to treat (ITT) arm, whatever the actually received treatment. Patients without progression and alive at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest assessment.
Primary Endpoint Analysis: Progression Free Survival PFS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of the first objective progression accordingly to RECIST or death (whatever its cause in the absence of progression). Patients without progression and alive at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest assessment. The primary analysis will take place when 106 events have been observed. This analysis will use the logrank test, stratified on the primary location and the time of onset of the bone metastases (synchronous vs metachronous). Cox regression model will also be used to perform a sensitivity analysis taking into account the usual prognostic factors. The hazard ratio will be given with its 95% confidence interval. A 
An Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), with expertise and experience in the pathology, and without direct involvement in the conduct of the trial, will be set up specifically to guarantee effective protection of patients, insure the ethical conduct of the trial, benefit/risk ratio of the trial, and to ensure the independent review of the scientific results during the trial and at the end of the trial. The DSMC will meet after 60 patients are accrued in the experimental arm to review toxicity outcomes and compliance.
The DSMC may recommend the early termination of the trial if one of the following conditions is met: an unacceptable toxicity or all available data from the trial or any other source of information are sufficiently convincing to influence the therapeutical practices of the majority of clinicians. The DSMC has only a consultative role; it will inform the sponsor who will decide whether the DSMC recommendation will be followed. An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, in a patient or clinical trial subject treated by a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The assessment of whether there is a reasonable causal relationship is made by the investigator. Notification must be carried out immediately by fax to the R&D UNICANCER pharmacovigilance unit by sending the form “notification of a Serious Adverse Effects”, located in the Investigator Master File, completed as precisely as possible, dated and signed by the physician-investigator.
The follow-up of bone metastasis evaluation is difficult by means of anatomic imaging (CT-scan). There is a need to identify biologic markers that would predict bone disease progression (DP) and risk of skeletal-related events (SREs) as sequelae of bone metastases. As this ancillary study, we have chosen to explore s-CTX and bone alkaline phosphatase (b-ALP) to better quantify response to SBRT vs standard treatment [
Cost-utility, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact analyses performed on QALYs (Quality-Adjusted Life Years) and ICERs (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios) calculation based on EQ-5D-3L questionnaire will provide useful and complementary information in order (i) to recommend the best strategy to adopt; (ii) to estimate the budget impact on the French National Health Insurance of the generalization of the cost-effective strategy [
Stereotactic radiotherapy is a routine treatment for brain, hepatic and lung metastases with increased probability of local control. However, Loco Regional Control is similar to bone metastasis than other localizations with 95% and a good control of pain and patients with oligometastasis had a longer survival with better local control for spine metastasis [
The tools required for high precision radiotherapy are now commercially available and implemented in many radiotherapy departments. Sufficient clinical experience has been acquired so that large randomized trials can confidently be launched. Current knowledge is mainly based on retrospective and prospectives non-randomized studies, thus suffering from heterogeneous population and inappropriate sample power. The oligometastatic concept has been developed in the last years and recent trials show interesting results on adding Metastase Directed Treatment (MDT) (such as radiotherapy or surgery) at standard therapy. However, despite encouraging data, some authors remain skeptical that MDT will delay the use of systemic treament.
In a randomized phase II trial, named SABR-COMET, a benefit in OS in the SBRT arm for the oligometastatic setting compared to palliative treatment was demonstrated (41 months vs 28 months) [
Two other randomized trials, SARON and CORE investigate the same approach in different clinical settings with oligometastatic patients [

The safety and efficacy of SABR as oligometastasis-directed treatment is increasingly being evaluated within prospective clinical trials. These data are awaited to compliment the abundance of existing observational studies and to guide clinical decision-making.

COVID-19 is associated with both venous and arterial thrombotic complications. While prophylactic anticoagulation is now widely recommended for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the effectiveness and safety of thromboprophylaxis in outpatients with COVID-19 has not been established.
PREVENT-HD is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, pragmatic, event-driven phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in symptomatic outpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 at risk for thrombotic events, hospitalization, and death. Several challenges posed by the pandemic have necessitated innovative approaches to clinical trial design, start-up, and conduct. Participants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by time from COVID-19 confirmation, to either rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily or placebo for 35 days. The primary efficacy end point is a composite of symptomatic venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, non-central nervous system systemic embolization, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality. The primary safety end point is fatal and critical site bleeding according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis definition. Enrollment began in August 2020 and is expected to enroll approximately 4,000 participants to yield the required number of end point events.
PREVENT-HD is a pragmatic trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of the direct oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban in the outpatient setting to reduce major venous and arterial thrombotic events, hospitalization, and mortality associated with COVID-19.
COVID-19 has rapidly emerged as the world's most pressing infectious threat. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS Co-V-2) responsible for this condition has proven to be readily transmissible, with significant morbidity and a high case fatality rate
While acknowledging the potential benefit of post-hospitalization thromboprophylaxis, expert opinion and guidance statements have disagreed on the need for primary thromboprophylaxis in outpatients with COVID-19 with thrombotic risk factors.
Coagulopathy and COVID-19 pathogenesis. Coagulopathy and diffuse pulmonary microthrombi have been documented in COVID-19. While coagulopathy is a known consequence of inflammatory changes, it is unclear if SARS-Co-V-2 independently affects hypercoagulability. Coagulopathy, along with viral endothelial injury, leads to diffuse pulmonary microthrombi which may potentiate pulmonary injury in addition to alveolar damage from SARS-Co-V-2 infection as well as macrothrombotic events. Factor Xa can also play a role in cell entry and infection by SARS-Co-V-2, and therefore viral propagation. Outpatient anticoagulation with rivaroxaban, a specific Factor Xa inhibitor, has the potential to prevent thromboembolic events as well as pulmonary microthrombi and progression of pulmonary insufficiency in COVID-19, reducing the need for hospitalization.
Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are favored due to their oral administration, selective coagulation factor inhibition, lack of required blood monitoring, and safety profile relative to vitamin K antagonists.
Rivaroxaban, a selective factor Xa inhibitor, has been investigated in a comprehensive cardiovascular development program, establishing risk reduction of venous and arterial thrombotic events in a variety of indications.
PREVENT-HD is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pragmatic, event-driven phase 3 study to assess the efficacy of rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily in preventing venous and arterial thrombotic events, hospitalization, and death in outpatients with symptomatic COVID-19. The trial is being conducted at large integrated health care delivery networks to facilitate centralized patient recruitment and follow-up, and to enable a pilot study of alternative methods of data collection through integration of a cloud-based data capture tool with electronic medical records (EMR). The study design incorporates several innovative processes intended to reduce exposure of health care providers to SARS Co-V-2, monitor the safety of study participants, and enhance the efficiency of study conduct using advanced informatics integration (
Innovative aspects of PREVENT-HD trial conduct
PREVENT-HD study design. 
The inclusion criteria are designed to enroll a representative population of symptomatic adult outpatients with COVID-19 with at least one additional risk factor for thrombosis and with a low bleeding risk, and for whom the initial treatment plan does not include hospitalization. Study participants must be at least 18 years of age, have documented COVID-19, have symptoms attributable to COVID-19, and have an additional risk factor for venous or arterial thromboembolic disease, including elevated D-dimer level, thrombophilia, prior venous thromboembolism, history of cancer, coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, cerebrovascular disease or ischemic stroke; or a risk factor associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes (age ≥60 years of age, body mass index ≥35 kg/m
PREVENT-HD inclusion/exclusion criteria
Subjects are identified through site specific EMR searches to notify coordinators of potential subjects having a recent positive test result for COVID-19. At some sites, such searches are supplemented with additional inclusion and exclusion criteria verifiable through the EMR. Potential subjects are then called to verify eligibility and to assess interest. Consent is generally obtained electronically, while the site communicates directly by phone or by virtual meeting platforms. For some participants unable to provide consent electronically, the consent is verified using paper forms.
Participants meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria may be randomized from the date of the positive COVID-19 test until 14 days later, inclusive. All participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either rivaroxaban 10 mg or matching oral placebo once daily for 35 days through use of a central computerized interactive voice/web response system that conceals study drug assignment from investigators. Randomization will be further stratified by the time from positive diagnostic of COVID-19 test to randomization, into an early-dosed cohort (1-5 days) and a later-dosed cohort (6-14 days). The protocol also allows capping of enrollment of participants with certain risk factors to enable an adequate assessment of subgroups with particular risk factors. Enrollment began in August 2020 and will continue to an expected total of approximately 4,000 participants randomized to achieve the target number of end point events. The study is being performed in accordance with all local laws and regulations, and with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and the International Council on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The study protocol and informed consent have been reviewed and approved by the responsible health authorities and Institutional Review Boards for all participating study sites.
Study drug provided to participants is double-blinded rivaroxaban 10 mg or matching placebo taken once daily. This dose and duration of rivaroxaban was selected for PREVENT-HD primarily based on previous results in medically ill populations,
The protocol allows treatment with all clinically-recommended therapies according to local practice, including any prescribed medications intended to inhibit SARS Co-V-2 activity. Drugs that interact with rivaroxaban to either significantly increase or decrease rivaroxaban concentrations are prohibited; such medications include combined P-glycoprotein and strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, or combined P-glycoprotein and strong CYP3A4 inducers. Of importance, dexamethasone, commonly used in the treatment of COVID-19, is not a prohibited medication. Medications that significantly increase the risk of bleeding in the setting of rivaroxaban therapy, such as anticoagulants, dual antiplatelet regimens, or high-dose antiplatelet monotherapy (eg, aspirin >162 mg daily, clopidogrel >75 mg daily, or ticlopidine >250 mg daily), are also prohibited. Single antiplatelet agents including these drugs at lower doses, ticagrelor, and prasugrel are allowed, with the caution that participants should be monitored for increased risk of bleeding. If any prohibited medication is clinically indicated, blinded study drug is to be discontinued while the prohibited medication is taken.
Participants are randomized on study Day 1 and will take blinded study medication once daily through to study Day 35. All study activities will occur remotely, including screening for eligibility, consent, and follow-up. Following randomization, participants are automatically flagged for drug dispensation through an automated system. A centralized drug depot sends study drug directly to the patient's home by the next day. Delivery is confirmed by telephone contact on Day 3. To further minimize potential study related COVID-19 exposures, subjects receive detailed instructions for safe self-disposal of any unused study drug rather than being required to return drug to the site.
Participants will undergo virtual study visits on Day 1 (defined as Day of randomization), and on Days 3, 14, 35, and 49. At each follow-up contact, participants are assessed for study drug adherence (via questioning start/stop dates and missed doses of study drug), adverse events including bleeding, and any potential study end point events. To aid in site follow-up of subjects, PREVENT-HD will leverage the REDCap Cloud platform to integrate with each site's local EMR system (
Data flow in PREVENT-HD. Study data are collected remotely by site staff. Key data flow in daily to weekly from the local hospital electronic medical records (EMR), through REDCap Cloud, to a parallel clinical database. Data from EMR can be used in real time to identify eligible subjects to consent remotely, and to monitor for outcome events in enrolled participants. Site staff conduct virtual follow-up visits by phone or telehealth and enter data from outside the hospital system into electronic case report forms. Participants do not need to leave home through the duration of the study.
The EMR domains selected for the pilot study were purposely chosen to be generic and applicable to future clinical studies (eg, health care or hospital encounters, demographics, medications, labs, prior medical, or surgical diagnoses). This component of the trial is intended to explore new methods of data acquisition that may expand central monitoring capabilities and improve the efficiency of site monitoring by reducing or eliminating the requirement to perform on-site or remote source data verification. The pilot will also explore whether EMR data can replace manual transcription of study data into the clinical database for selected fields. For this study, all data will also be manually entered by site personnel into a conventional electronic data capture system for regulatory purposes and to allow for comparisons.
The primary efficacy end point is a composite including symptomatic VTE, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, non-central nervous system (non-CNS) systemic embolization, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality up to Day 35. Because many of the components of this end point are typically associated with hospitalization, the study end point represents significant morbidities that are meaningful to an outpatient population. Secondary and exploratory efficacy end points are further listed in 
PREVENT-HD trial outcomes
All primary end points and most secondary end points will undergo adjudication against trial end point definitions by trained, experienced physicians at each site who remain blinded to treatment assignment. To participate as a physician adjudicator, individuals must undergo additional training on the application of standardized event definitions. Adjudicators are instructed to contact the academic research organization for questions related to complicated cases or unanticipated circumstances, which are then logged as conventions to be applied to future cases across sites. This model of site-level adjudication allows for efficiency gains by taking advantage of full access to local EMR systems for source document review. All end point definitions used in PREVENT-HD are provided in the Appendix. Centralized oversight of local adjudicators is conducted through centralized training, use of conventions, and guidance to local adjudicators through periodic meetings to minimize site-level variability in adjudication.
Efficacy analyses will be conducted on all randomized patients using the principle of intention-to-treat up to day 35 after randomization; safety analyses will be conducted on all patients that received at least one dose of study drug until 2 days after the last dose of study medication. Treatment assignment will be balanced within a clinical site by block randomization. The randomization will be stratified by the time from COVID-19 positive test to randomization (1-5 days inclusive, 6-14 days inclusive). The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the time from randomization to the first adjudicated occurrence of any component of the primary composite end point up to day 35. The primary efficacy analysis will be done using a stratified log-rank test by the time from COVID-19 positive test to randomization with the treatment as a variable. The primary efficacy outcome will be tested at a 2-sided significance level of 5%, with appropriate apportioning of alpha to account for one planned interim analysis. Secondary end points will be analyzed hierarchically, in the order listed in 
The trial is event-driven such that it would require 333 confirmed first primary end point events to detect an anticipated hazard ratio of 0.70 between the study arms, with 90% power at a 2-sided 5% significance level. It was determined that the study required approximately 4,000 participants in order to have 333 patients experience a component of the primary end point over 35 days with a placebo rate of the primary outcome of 10%. If the blinded, pooled event rate proves to be lower than anticipated, enrollment of up to 5,000 participants will be considered (corresponding to an event rate in the placebo group of 7.8%, all else constant) to achieve the requisite number of events. The estimate for primary outcome event rate was estimated from unpublished data from the Northwell system (Spyropoulos AC, personal communication) suggesting a 10% hospitalization rate in unselected patients, and CDC information suggesting approximately 8% nationally in patients 18 years of age and older. The case fatality rate for unselected patients is approximately 2.3% nationally. It was also assumed that most, but not all thromboembolic events and deaths might occur after hospitalization.
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) is responsible for monitoring the safety of study participants throughout the trial and will perform a minimum of one interim analysis for futility or overwhelming superiority once approximately 50% of the required 333 first primary efficacy events have been observed. The stopping rule for overwhelming superiority uses an O'Brien-Fleming boundary (Z = 2.96, alpha = 0.003) approach. The IDMC may consider additional factors and request additional interim analyses (with appropriate apportionment of alpha to control the type 1 error rate) to make decisions on trial conduct.
PREVENT-HD is being conducted at up to approximately 15 sites affiliated with integrated health care delivery networks in the United States. The trial is sponsored by Janssen Research and Development, LLC (Raritan, NJ) and conducted in partnership with CPC Clinical Research (CPC; Aurora, CO), a nonprofit Academic Research Organization that is affiliated with the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. An Executive Committee (EC) is responsible for oversight of the study with unrestricted access to the necessary data to fulfill this role and will submit the results of the study for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. CPC provides administrative support to the EC, and IDMC, and helps to oversee consistency in site end point confirmation. REDCap Cloud provided oversight for defining the EMR data fields to be collected from each site and for establishing the necessary technical connections for the integration/transfer of EMR data from sites to REDCap Cloud to the study database. No direct funding was provided to support development of the current manuscript. The authors are solely responsible for drafting and editing of the manuscript, and its final contents.
PREVENT-HD is registered on clinicaltrials.gov under number NCT04508023. Major milestones for the PREVENT-HD trial include establishment of the EC in June 2020, initial protocol finalization in June 2020, first site open for enrollment in August 2020 with the first participant also randomized in August 2020. The first EMR integration was completed in October 2020. The planned interim analysis is anticipated by the second quarter of 2021, and study completion is anticipated by the end of 2021. These timelines will be highly dependent on the dynamics of the pandemic and effective implementation of public health measures and/or widely utilized effective vaccines.
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a unique global public health crisis. As our understanding of this disease evolves, there is increasing recognition of its severity and its association with a myriad of adverse complications including thrombotic events. Notably, thrombotic events have been reported in up to 4.5% of relatively healthy individuals with COVID-19 in the outpatient setting not requiring hospitalization.
The PREVENT-HD trial was designed to answer the hypothesis that initiation of prophylactic-dose rivaroxaban early in the course of COVID-19 infection, prior to hospitalization, will reduce the risk of thrombosis, hospitalization, and death, and to evaluate the safety of such a strategy. It has been designed to answer this hypothesis with the rigor of a double-blind, randomized event driven design, but with innovative aspects intended to improve feasibility, reduce risk to study participants and study staff, and maximize data transfer and informatics capabilities.
The timeline from the beginning of protocol drafting to first participant visit was only 127 days (
Study start-up timeline in PREVENT-HD. To respond to the public health crisis presented by COVID-19, study start-up timelines for PREVENT-HD were accelerated. From first draft of the protocol to first participant enrolled required only 127 days. 
In responding to COVID-19, PREVENT-HD also responds to the recognized need to increase efficiency and decrease costs of conducting registration trials.
In addition to the innovative approach, PREVENT HD seeks to answer an important scientific question in COVID-19. While most research is currently focused on the role of anticoagulation in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, it is possible that decreasing thrombotic risk earlier in the course of disease may prevent some aspects of disease progression and pulmonary injury such as microvascular thrombosis. PREVENT-HD is one of a limited number of placebo-controlled trials registered on clinicaltrials.gov examining antithrombotic interventions in outpatients with COVID-19. A smaller trial (
Of note, 2 observational case-control analyses reported no effect of preadmission exposure to either antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulant therapy prescribed for other clinical indications on presenting acute respiratory distress syndrome, intensive care unit admission rates, or mortality rates for patients admitted with COVID-19.
If rivaroxaban can provide thromboembolic benefits in the outpatient COVID-19 population, another important question to be answered by PREVENT-HD is whether this benefit comes at an unacceptably elevated risk of bleeding. A disseminated intravascular coagulation-like picture can be seen late in COVID-19; while this pattern of laboratory abnormalities can be associated with a bleeding diathesis, bleeding complications in COVID-19 are generally infrequent.
A potential concern is completing an outpatient trial in COVID-19 with rapidly-shifting self-prevention practices, improved COVID-19 therapeutics, and the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. However, there are currently limited therapeutic options for slowing disease progression in the outpatient setting; therefore, the primary outcome, which includes hospitalization, should be robust to these evolving social factors. Furthermore, vaccine distribution and administration may leave significant proportions of the population vulnerable over the next 1 to 2 years. Knowledge of therapeutic approaches to minimize morbidity and relieve stress on inpatient services will remain critical.
Patients with COVID-19 are at an increased risk of venous and arterial thrombotic events, and this tendency for thrombosis may play an important role in disease progression requiring hospitalization. The role of prophylactic anticoagulation in the pre-hospital setting has not yet been established. PREVENT-HD is a pragmatic trial, with innovative design features to respond to needs in the context of an infectious pandemic and beyond. This trial will evaluate, in symptomatic outpatients with COVID-19 with at least one additional thrombotic risk factor who are at low risk for bleeding, the efficacy and safety of the 10mg once daily dose of rivaroxaban to reduce thrombotic events, hospitalizations, and mortality.

Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) is an innovative choice for postoperative pain management. However, the safety and effectiveness of this traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapy for patients who underwent gastrectomy is largely unknown. So, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of TEAS for patients who underwent gastrectomy.
We recruited 96 patients with gastric cancer from May 2019 to November 2019; 82 patients were enrolled, and 81 patients completed. Patients were randomly assigned to TEAS group (TG) received TEAS on postoperative day (POD) 1–3 or control group (CG) at a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcomes were pain score and consumption of analgesics. The secondary were the time of first postoperative flatus and defecation, frequency of postoperative nausea, vomiting, distention, diarrhea, comfort of semi-fluid diet, Clavien-Dindo grade (C-D grade) and length of postoperative day. We performed hematological analysis to explore the possible mechanisms.
Overall, 81 patients were enrolled included in the analysis. Compared with CG, pain scores in TG were lower on POD 1–5 (average: 2.55±0.21 vs 3.10±0.42, 
TEAS can relieve postoperative pain and promote the recovery of gastrointestinal function. Consequently, it can be an adjunctive therapy to enhance postoperative recovery for patients after gastrectomy.
In 2018, gastric cancer was the fifth most prevalent cancer and ranked third in cancer-related mortality.
Acupuncture is an ancient empirical medicine in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Nowadays, it has been demonstrated that acupuncture can be of benefit to pain control.
This was an unblinded randomized controlled trial. The protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, and its ethical approval number is QYFYKYLL201812. It was carried out at the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, between May 1, 2019 and October 31, 2019. A total of 96 patients were recruited. Eighty-two patients who were eligible for inclusion criteria were randomly assigned into TEAS group (TG) receiving 3-consecutive-day TEAS and control group (CG) at a 1:1 ratio. During the perioperative period, the same ERAS protocol (See

We selected several acupoints with potential functions of pain relief and promoting gastrointestinal recovery. According to the WHO standard acupuncture point locations (
For patients in TG, they received TEAS therapy at 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. on postoperative day (POD) 1–3 lasting 30 minutes each time. After sterilizing the skin surrounding the acupoints with 75% alcohol, we applied the electrode pads on the acupoints.
The device we used was Huatuo Electronic Acupuncture Treatment Instrument 
The primary outcomes of this trial were as follows: (1) Pain score. We used numerical rating scale (NRS, in 10 levels and we have improved the basic unit by dividing the 10 levels into 20 levels, ie, 0.5 as a unit) combined with the Wong-Baker faces pain rating scale. We recorded the pain score at 6-time points (last night till 8:00, 8:00, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00, time before sleep) a day from POD 1 to POD 5. On POD 0, we recorded the pain scores at the awake time postoperatively and other time points at the above. (2) Consumption of analgesics. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were used for mild to moderate pain, and opioids were used for moderate to severe pain. We used NSAIDs (flurbiprofen axetil) once on POD 1 regularly and then we made prescriptions according to the conditions of patients. And we recorded consumption of NSAIDs by doses and opioids by equivalent doses of morphine (pethidine: pentazocine: dezocine: morphine=100mg: 30–60mg: 10mg: 10mg). It should be noted that all patients enrolled did not use PCA.
The secondary outcomes were as follows: time of first postoperative flatus and defecation, frequency of postoperative nausea, vomiting, distention, diarrhea, fever, comfort of semi-fluid diet (patient subjective score, range 0–10), Clavien-Dindo grade and length of postoperative day. For definition of fever, we set 37.3°C. And we measured the temperature 6 times a day and recorded it once if it appears.
We collected patients’ peripheral venous blood on POD 1, POD 3 and POD 5 for analysis. White blood cell count (WBC), percentage of neutrophils (NEC%), C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) were measured with plasma; β-endorphin (β-End), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), motilin (MTL) were measured with serum (serum samples were centrifuged at 2000g for 10 min, and the serum was stored at −80°C until analysis) by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The kit was purchased from Jiangsu Yutong Biological Technology Co., Ltd.
All frequency-type outcomes (such as nausea, vomiting frequency, etc.) were collected by querying patients at 8:00, 12:00, 18:00 daily and it was recorded once there was an appearance. All data were recorded by Yulong Tian and Zequn Li.
The sample size justification of this trial was based on the preliminary data of pain scores which was from a pilot study we previously performed in our center. The results of the pilot study showed that the average pain score of POD 1–5 were 2.80±0.45 and 3.20±0.72 for TG and CG groups, respectively. With an equal randomization and assuming the dropout rate was less than 10%, a sample size of 82 patients (41 in the TG and 41 in the CG) will ensure the power was at least 80% to detect the difference at a significant level of 0.05, using a two-sided 
We randomized patients according to the order of the random number table generated by SPSS 21.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). We determined the random allocation sequence according to the time when patients signed the informed consent for anesthesia, and Yuqi Sun was responsible for allocating the patients according to the random number table.
All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 21.0 and Graphpad Prism 8.0.2 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). The level of significance for all statistical tests was set at 0.05 (

Postoperative pain and gastrointestinal dysfunction are two major stumbling blocks that affect the recovery of patients. In addition, as far as pain is concerned, acute and chronic pain that occur during hospitalization and after discharge have caused huge medical and healthcare pressure in European and American countries.
Pain management plays a particularly important role in the rehabilitation process. ERAS emphasizes the necessity of effective pain relief targeting the trauma-induced stress.
According to the theory of TCM, factors such as trauma and anesthesia can lead to Qi and blood obstructed or insufficient, which may cause kinds of pain or visceral dysfunction. Dialectical treatment is the foundation of TCM, and the principles are treating excess with purgation, treating insufficiency with tonification. The acupoints with more similar characteristic are chosen, the better therapeutic effects will achieve. Theoretically, among the selected acupoints in this trial, they are effective in harmonizing meridians and balancing Yin Yang. Hence TEAS with acupoints above took function of enhancing the recovery of patients.
Based on the available evidence, the mechanisms of TEAS analgesia involves several systems such as endorphin system and adrenergic system, in which endorphin system plays a key role.
Not only inner analgesics, there were changes in nociception-related factors such as trauma-induced inflammation. TNF-α and IL-6 both are important indicators to reflect the extent of stress and inflammation. TNF-α is the earliest inflammatory molecule under stress and it participates in the immunomodulation and anti-infection. IL-6 can integrate and cooperate other inflammatory signals to promote inflammation. After the patients suffering from surgical injury, the body will release a variety of nociceptive medias attributing pain. On the one hand, TNF-α and IL-6 which may overexpress under stress will increase in the injured tissue and central nervous system (CNS), then exacerbate inflammation. On the other hand, these inflammatory molecules also promote the release of phospholipids from tissue, then phospholipids break down into prostaglandins,
So, superficially it may be another explanation that the anti-nociceptive effects of TEAS may through its regulation of inflammation. Based on what we mentioned above, we think that it may come down to the immunomodulation of TEAS. As we all know, it’s extremely common that patients with gastric cancer have immune dysfunction. Stress reactions of varying extent caused by operation, anesthesia and pain will further lead to immunosuppression.
Postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction may occur because of surgical operation (damage of vagal nerve, changes in physiological structure), CO
There were some limitations in this trial: (1) We did not collect and stratify the social class, personality characteristics which may cause unknown bias. (2) About secretion of transmitters such as endorphins, there is a circadian pattern in the body which may lead to a biological rhythm of pain. So, time deviation may exist in the process of collecting clinical data. (3) In the analysis of consumption of opioids, for pentazocine, the equivalent dose of morphine is 30 to 60 mg. Due to individual differences in pharmacodynamics, we have not found a clear equivalent dose for the Chinese constitution. (4) 2/100Hz mode is more common in other trials, and the reasons why we choose 20/100Hz are as follows. First, the frequency of 15–30Hz is more effective in promoting the release of oxytocin than 2–3Hz, and oxytocin can also relieve pain and enhance the analgesic effect of electroacupuncture. Second, 15Hz can both promote the release of β-End and Enk. Although it is not as effective as 2Hz in releasing β-End,
In Summary, it was confirmed that TEAS played a role in relieving postoperative pain and promoting the recovery of gastrointestinal function, which may be related to the modulation of inflammation. And there was no adverse reaction during the entire trial. Therefore, TEAS can be used as an adjuvant therapy to enhance the postoperative recovery for patients with gastric cancer.

Nausea and vomiting are among the most common and distressing side effects of chemotherapy. Difference in views about the effectiveness of auricular acupuncture (AA) versus electroacupuncture (EA) of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) lies at the heart of the debate. The aim of this study is to compare the antiemetic efficacy and safety of AA and EA for CINV.
One hundred twenty participants, 18 to 75 years old malignant tumors will receiving chemotherapy with cisplatin, will be recruited and randomized into 3 groups equally, Group A (the AA group), Group B (the EA group), and Group C (the control group). The participants in Group A and Group B will receive AA or EA regimens, alternatively, beginning on the day before first day of chemotherapy for a third consecutive cycles. All participants will continue to receive conventional treatment. The incidence and severity of CINV will be assessed using the definition and classification of nausea and vomiting (NCI-CTC AE4.0) and the MASCC (Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer) Antiemesis Tool (MAT). Secondary outcome measures include the degree of abdominal distension, the first time of flatus and defecation, and life quality. Additionally, adverse events will also be documented during the period of the treatment.
This trial may provide evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness and safety of AA versus EA for CINV following cisplatin-based regimens.
This study is registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR2000040942.
Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is among the most common and distressing side effects of chemotherapy.
Cisplatin, which is a cornerstone of chemotherapy for the treatment of multiple cancers, is a highly emetogenic chemotherapy drug.
Although the mechanisms underlying CINV are not clear enough,
An increasing body of evidence points that electroacupuncture (EA) may provide modest benefits in the treatment of CINV.
To our knowledge, there are no randomized controlled trails comparing the effect and safety of AA versus EA in cancer patients who experience CINV. Therefore, the present study is designed to determine the efficacy and safety of AA versus EA in ameliorating CINV among patients receiving cisplatin-based regimens.
This is a singular center, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Using a balanced random approach, all participants will be recruited and assigned to 3 groups: Group A (the AA group), Group B (the EA group), and Group C (the control group), after meeting the eligibility criteria, and completing informed consent.
This trial will be accomplished strictly followed the principles for medical ethics outlined in the 2013 updated Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of Chengdu Second People's Hospital, China (ethics reference: 2020077). This committee is an ethical approval committee organized by leading professors in their own fields. It will be obtained from all participants in advance that written and signed informed consent. This trial has been registered on 
All participants will be recruited from the Oncology Department of Chengdu Second People's Hospital, a tertiary hospital, which plays the leading role at the local. We will recruit cases diagnosed with magnificent tumor confirmed by clinicopathology or cytology undergoing the cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens. Participants who fulfil the inclusion criteria and sign informed consent forms will enter the screening period, otherwise will be excluded before randomization. Chengdu is the largest base of industrial technology and commercial and financial center in the west of China, with a population of 14,047,600, where could collect more cases of diversity. The duration of enrollment is from December 31, 2020 to December 30, 2022.
Eligible participants are all adults aged 18 to 75 years, diagnosed with magnificent tumor confirmed by clinicopathology or cytology undergoing the cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens and an expected survival time of >3 months. They are still in relatively good physical condition, with a Kamofsky score >60.
The exclusion criteria are as follows: nausea and vomiting caused by intracranial or other metastases, severe gastrointestinal obstruction, or combine organic disorders; recent using drugs may cause nausea and vomiting; participants with allergy history, especially to metal and tape; participants with inability to communicate; participants participating in another clinical trial within 3 months.
The withdrawal criteria are as follows: terminate or adjust the chemotherapy regimen after evaluation by oncologists due to clinical exacerbation; at the patient's own request or at the request of their legal representative.
Participants in all groups will receive conventional Western medical treatments as recommended by the Guidelines of Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology: Prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting caused by antitumor therapies,
Patients receiving acupuncture therapy will be treated bilaterally at 2 distal acupoints: Neiguan (PC6) and Zusanli (ST36). PC6 is an acupoint of the pericardium meridian. It is located between the palmaris longus tendon and the flexor carpi radialis muscle tendon, 2 cun above the rasceta. ST36 is located on the anterolateral side of the lower leg, 3 cun below Dubi and one finger width lateral of the anterior border of the tibia. The location of these acupoints is described in The National Standard of Acupoint Location. Detailed information on the acupuncture treatment is provided in Table 
Detailed information about acupuncture treatment according to STRICTA guideline.
Participants in Group A will receive the following treatment. After each insertion site be disinfected with 75% alcohol, sterile intradermal acupuncture needles (PYONEX, ϕ0.2 × 1.2 mm, SEIRIN Corporation, Japan) will be inserted vertically to a depth of 1.2 mm. Participants will be requested to put pressure on the each auricular point for about 15 seconds per one time, 3 times per day.
As for the participants in Group B, Shukang brand needles (size 0.25 mm × 40 mm) made by Changchun Aikang Medical Devices Co., Ltd., China, will be used to perform the acupuncture treatments. Stimulation will be applied until the patient experiences de qi (obtains qi). A patient's experience of de qi may take on multiple unique manifestations at the needle site itself and/or around the site of needle manipulation including soreness, aching, numbness, tingling, and even warmth. Electrical stimulation of acupuncture needles will be done at the frequency of 15 Hz with continuous wave in order to ensure patient comfort, lasting 30 minutes.
Participants in the above 2 groups will individually be needled for 4 days, beginning on the day before first day of chemotherapy and ending on the last day of it. The intervention will be applied for a third consecutive cycle. Only well-trained acupuncturists with >5 years of clinical experience could conduct acupuncture manipulation.
Subjects in the control group (Group C) will not receive acupuncture treatments. They will receive conventional Western medicine treatment only.
All patients undergo supervision and evaluation of curative effect at 10 am daily, until discharge. A third party will perform all data analysis. The flow chart of this trial is shown in Fig. 
The flow chart of this study.
The primary outcome measure will be the definition and classification of nausea and vomiting (NCI-CTC AE4.0) and the MASCC (Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer) Antiemesis Tool (MAT) score, 24 hours and fourth day after chemotherapy, for a third consecutive cisplatin-based chemotherapy cycle. These 2 scales are used to describe the condition and degree of CINV in cancers, and strongly recommended by different international guidelines and widely applied. They are easy-to-use and evaluate the likelihood of a patient's condition. The definition and classification of nausea and vomiting stages the nausea and vomiting into 3 and 4 grades, respectively; and MAT is comprised of 2 sections: 24 hours later and 4 days later. In terms of MAT, each section has 4 identical items including occurrence of nausea and vomiting, frequency of vomiting, and level of nausea.
Secondary outcome measures are as follows:
Abdominal distension is defined as a score of Likert-type scale at 24 hours and fourth day after chemotherapy. Scores on Likert-type scale range from 1 to 5, with a score of 5 indicating no symptoms; a score of 1 indicating severe distension, interfering sleep (Table 
The time of first defecation is recorded as a relatively objective indicator to describe the digestive function of participants.
The World Health Organization Quality of Life scale will be performed on each patient once a month, 3 times in total.
The Likert-type scale.
Any adverse events or abnormalities will be recorded on case report forms no matter what intervention is used. The severity of such adverse events will be described as mild, moderate, or severe, and the relation of the events to the intervention will be evaluated as not related, possibly related, or related. If any serious adverse events occur as the result of a certain intervention, that intervention will be stopped immediately and appropriate corrective action will be taken. Any serious adverse events will be reported promptly to the institutional review board, according to the protocol.
Using the frequency of onset as the primary outcome measurement, NQuery Advisor software (version 4.0, Statistical Solutions, Ireland) was used to calculate the appropriate sample size. Based on literature research, the sample size was estimated according to the calculation formula of non-inferiority test. α = 0.025, β = 0.2, non-inferiority margin δ = 15%, ε is the actual difference among groups. One-way test was performed, and the sample size was calculated to show that 103 samples are needed in this study. One hundred eighteen cases were needed in the 3 groups, assuming a 10% non-adherence to treatment and a 5% loss to follow-up. In this study, a total of 120 cases were selected from 3 groups, 40 cases in each group.
Randomization of subjects to 2 groups will be on the basis of a concealed allocation approach using statistical analysis PROCPLAN statements (SAS 9.4; World Headquarters SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). A computer-generated list of random numbers will be used to determine the allocation of the participants, with numbered opaque sealed envelopes containing the randomization schedule. The envelopes will be kept by an investigator who is not an assessor in the study and will be informed of the outcomes at the end of the study. In this trial, participants and acupuncture practitioners cannot be blinded. The researchers recording the outcomes and those making the conclusions will be all blinded to patients’ assessments.
All continuous data will be expressed as mean ± standard deviation. For these data, a 
Acupoint therapies, including EA and AA, have the characteristics of higher acceptability, limit side effects, and inexpensiveness.
To minimize the bias, stratified block randomization and blinding will be applied, and participants will be avoided any communication with others farthest, shaped by separate treatment time and diagnosis rooms.
Despite its strengths, this study has, nevertheless, an obvious limitation. It is a single-center study, which may limit its generalizability so a future multiple-center large-sample size study will be needed. However, the results of this trail will provide more evidence and will help medical staffs make a better choice for patients.

Initial results from various phase-III trials on vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are promising. For proper translation of these results to clinical guidelines, it is essential to determine how well the general population is reflected in the study populations of these trials. This study was conducted among 7162 participants (age-range: 51–106 years; 58% women) from the Rotterdam Study. We quantified the proportion of participants that would be eligible for the nine ongoing phase-III trials. We further quantified the eligibility among participants at high risk to develop severe COVID-19. Since many trials were not explicit in their exclusion criterion with respect to ‘acute’ or ‘unstable preexisting’ diseases, we performed two analyses. First, we included all participants irrespective of this criterion. Second, we excluded persons with acute or ‘unstable preexisting’ diseases. 97% of 7162 participants was eligible for any trial with eligibility for separate trials ranging between 11–97%. For high-risk individuals the corresponding numbers were 96% for any trial with separate trials ranging from 5–96%. Importantly, considering persons ineligible due to ‘acute’ or ‘unstable pre-existing’ disease drastically dropped the eligibilities for all trials below 43% for the total population and below 36% for high-risk individuals. The eligibility for ongoing vaccine trials against SARS-CoV-2 can reduce by half depending on interpretation and application of a single unspecified exclusion criterion. This exclusion criterion in our study would especially affect the elderly and those with pre-existing morbidities. These findings thus indicate the difficulty as well as importance of developing clinical recommendations for vaccination and applying these to the appropriate target populations. This becomes especially paramount considering the fact that many countries worldwide have initiated their vaccination programs by first targeting the elderly and most vulnerable persons.

Several phase III trials on vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are ongoing and initial results highly promising. A major issue of these phase III trials is to what extent the included study population is representative of the intended (or target) population, i.e. external validity.
For these trials, the intended target population is initially comprised of high-risk individuals usually considered to be elderly persons as well as those with comorbidities, and ultimately the entire world population. It remains unclear whether these target populations are representatively recruited into ongoing trials. This information is pivotal, since clinical recommendations for any approved vaccine should incorporate the proper target populations for which these vaccines have shown efficacy, and also determine those populations not sufficiently represented in the trials.
We sought to quantify the external validity of the various ongoing trials to a middle-aged and elderly West-European population from the Rotterdam Study. Specifically, we were interested to quantify what proportion of this study population would be eligible to participate in these trials and how many of those eligible are from high-risk categories.

We carried out our analyses in the population-based Rotterdam Study [
We applied eligibility criteria from each separate trial to our study population and calculated the following proportions: the proportion of participants eligible for any trial, and for each trial separately, the number of high-risk individuals in our study eligible for any trial, and for each trial separately.
We performed two complementary analyses and calculated the abovementioned proportions in each analysis separately. These two analyses differed with respect to the interpretation of an eligibility criterion that was not always explicitly specified in the various trial protocols. This criterion was often stated as follows: ‘

97% (N = 6945) of the total Rotterdam Study participants would be eligible for any trial in the first analysis, while this percentage dropped to 43% (N = 3107) in the second analysis. Among the 5781 participants at high-risk of severe COVID-19, 96% (N = 5564) would be eligible for any trial in the first analysis and 36% (N = 2102) in the second analysis (Fig. 
Figure 
The number and proportion of eligibility from the Rotterdam Study population for ongoing clinical phase III trials on a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. White bars indicate data from the first analysis; black bars indicate data from the second analysis. The difference between these two analyses is the operationalization, and thus inclusion or exclusion, of the eligibility criteria ‘(un)stable disease’, ‘acute course of disease’, or ‘other condition increasing risk of participation’. 
In a middle-aged and elderly population in the Netherlands from predominantly West-European descent, we found that 97% of this population would be eligible to participate in any of the nine currently ongoing vaccine trials against SARS-CoV-2. For persons at high-risk of severe COVID-19, the eligibility for any trial was 96%. Importantly, applying stricter exclusion based on the criterion ‘acute’ or ‘unstable preexisting’ disease drastically reduced the eligibility for any trial to 43% of the entire study population and 36% of the high-risk individuals.
Clinical trials are often considered the golden standard in efficacy research, due to several strengths by design with respect to internal validity. In contrast, whether findings from clinical trials are adequately translated to clinical practice also depends on their external validity. External validity is the extent to which findings from one study are applicable to target populations not represented in the actual study population. To properly gauge the actual study population, it is crucial that clinical trials explicitly report the setting of the trial, the exact intervention, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the characteristics of the actually recruited population [
The population of the Rotterdam Study is a lower-middle class population of primarily European descent. Previously, this population has shown good generalizability to the population of the Netherlands [
In conclusion, we found that eligibility for ongoing vaccine trials against SARS-CoV-2 can reduce by half depending on interpretation and application of a single unspecified exclusion criterion. This exclusion criterion in our study would especially affect the elderly and those with pre-existing morbidities. These findings thus indicate the difficulty as well as importance of developing clinical recommendations for vaccination and applying these to the appropriate target populations. This becomes especially paramount considering the fact that many countries worldwide have initiated their vaccination programs by first targeting the elderly and most vulnerable persons.

The classical pathway for diagnosing prostate cancer is systematic 12-core biopsy under the guidance of transrectal ultrasound, which tends to underdiagnose the clinically significant tumour and overdiagnose the insignificant disease. Another pathway named targeted biopsy is using multiparametric MRI to localise the tumour precisely and then obtain the samples from the suspicious lesions. Targeted biopsy, which is mainly divided into cognitive fusion method and software-based fusion method, is getting prevalent for its good performance in detecting significant cancer. However, the preferred targeted biopsy technique in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer between cognitive fusion and software-based fusion is still beyond consensus.
This trial is a prospective, single-centre, randomised controlled and non-inferiority study in which all men suspicious to have clinically significant prostate cancer are included. This study aims to determine whether a novel three-dimensional matrix positioning cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy is non-inferior to software-based fusion-targeted biopsy in the detection rate of clinically significant cancer in men without a prior biopsy. The main inclusion criteria are men with elevated serum prostate-specific antigen above 4–20 ng/mL or with an abnormal digital rectal examination and have never had a biopsy before. A sample size of 602 participants allowing for a 10% loss will be recruited. All patients will undergo a multiparametric MRI examination, and those who fail to be found with a suspicious lesion, with the anticipation of half of the total number, will be dropped. The remaining participants will be randomly allocated to cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy (n=137) and software-based fusion-targeted biopsy (n=137). The primary outcome is the detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer for cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy and software-based fusion-targeted biopsy in men without a prior biopsy. The clinically significant prostate cancer will be defined as the International Society of Urological Pathology grade group 2 or higher.
Ethical approval was obtained from the ethics committee of Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. The results of the study will be disseminated and published in international peer-reviewed journals.

This study is the first trial to compare a novel cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy, which is based on a three-dimensional matrix positioning method, with a software-based fusion-targeted biopsy.
The study will determine the efficacy of the novel cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.
Rigorous randomised design and allocation concealment method will reduce bias, which enables the higher reliability of the results.
This study takes place in one hospital, hence may make the finding less generalisable.
The study is performed in the centre that developed the guiding method, which may overestimate its performance as compared with less experienced readers.
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer worldwide which leads the five causes of death among men.
Thanks to the development of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) in identifying PCa, another pathway named targeted biopsy is getting prevalent. It aims to first perform an mpMRI for localising the tumour precisely and then obtain the samples from the suspicious lesions, and is shown to be more purposeful and less random compared with the systematic biopsy. Several pieces of evidence have proven the superiority of targeted biopsy in detection rates of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) and avoidance of unnecessary biopsy.
Targeted biopsy can be subdivided into three different methods: in-bore MRI, cognitive fusion and software-based fusion. An in-bore MRI-targeted biopsy is described as to perform a targeted biopsy under real-time MRI guidance. Although this method is accurate in locating the targeted lesions, it is a failure to be widely used in clinical practice for its inconvenience and time-consuming use.
We have developed a method named three-dimensional matrix positioning to increase the accuracy of cognitive fusion for targeted biopsy detection of csPCa, which involves several fiducial axes derived from MRI localisation of the region of interest, then transposed onto the ultrasound image to help direct the biopsy needle into the right place.
This trial aims to compare three-dimensional matrix positioning cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy and software-based fusion-targeted biopsy for the detection rate of csPCa for men without a prior biopsy for localised PCa. The primary objective is to assess whether the cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy is non-inferior to software-based fusion-targeted biopsy in the detection rate of clinically significant cancer.
This prospective, single-centre, randomised controlled and non-inferiority study will take place at Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. The primary objective of this study is to identify whether the three-dimensional matrix positioning cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy is non-inferior to software-based fusion-targeted biopsy in the detection rate of clinically significant cancer in men without a prior biopsy.

We chose the randomised trial instead of a paired cohort to reduce bias. Because if two biopsies are performed on the same participant, the progress of one may lead to the bleeding and deformation of the prostate, which will affect the progress of the other.
The primary outcome is the detection rate of csPCa for cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy and software-based fusion-targeted biopsy in men without a prior biopsy. The csPCa will be defined as International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group 2 or higher, according to the 2014 ISUP classification.
The main secondary outcomes are as follows:
The detection rate of any PCa for cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy and software-based fusion-targeted biopsy.
The detection rate of csPCa for each targeted technique combined with a template-guided biopsy.
The detection rate of any PCa for each targeted method combined with a template-guided biopsy.
The comparison of the results between the two urologists, including the detection rate of csPCa and any PCa in the targeted biopsy, template biopsy and combined biopsy.
The influence of prostate volume on the difference between the two fusion-targeted biopsies.
Patients with suspicious PCa and had no previous biopsy will be considered eligible for registration in this trial if they can meet all inclusion criteria and had no any exclusion criteria. The main criteria include men with elevated serum PSA above 4–20 ng/mL or with an abnormal DRE and have never had a biopsy before. The details of inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in

All participants who sign the informed consent will subsequently undergo a 3.0-Tesla mpMRI (Magnetom Skyra, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) with an 18-channel phased-array coil. The sequences of examination mainly included T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (acquired b-values 0, 400, 1000 and 2000 s/mm)
Only participants with a PI-RADS score 3, 4 or 5 will be allocated 1:1 to cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy group or software-based fusion-targeted biopsy group by using block randomisation. The random sequence will be generated by PROC PLAN statement of SAS v9.4 program which will be kept by one research nurse and blinded to other researchers. A random number will be revealed only when one participant is being randomised.
All biopsies in both arms will be performed via the perineum by two urologists (HW with an experience of more than 10 years and BH with an experience of more than 5 years) with an UltraView 800 ultrasound device (BK Ultrasound, USA) and a bi-planar TRUS probe (8848, BK Ultrasound) under a local anaesthetic block. Before performing the biopsy, one urologist will read the report and the image of MRI to identify the location of target lesions, while another one will be blinded to the MRI result.
Each participant in this arm will undergo a cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy first. A novel three-dimensional matrix positioning-based cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy will be performed under the guidance of a bi-plane TRUS probe after reviewing the mpMRI finding. Three cores of biopsy will be taken for each suspicious lesion which is showed in mpMRI with PI-RADS score of 3–5. The details of the cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy were described in our previous research.
The software-based fusion-targeted biopsy will be performed with the MIM symphony software by taking two-dimensional mpMRI images to create a three-dimensional map then be fused with the ultrasound images. Each suspicious area with a PI-RADS score equal to or more than 3 will be performed a three-core biopsy by one urologist, which will be followed with a 20-region template-guided biopsy by another. Also, whoever performs the targeted biopsy will be randomised.
A pathology group, which is blinded to all clinical data including the technique of biopsy, will evaluate the samples. The pathological finding will be reported within 2 weeks post-biopsy. Clinically significant cancer is defined as the ISUP grade group 2 or higher.
Continuous variables will be reported by using means with SDs or median with IQR, while categorical variables will be shown by using frequencies with proportions.
The primary analysis in this trial will follow the intention-to-treat principle, including all patients who have undergone randomisation. The primary outcome is the detection rate of csPCa for cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy and software-based fusion-targeted biopsy. The absolute difference between these two arms will be calculated with a 95% CI by estimating with a generalised linear model. The cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy will be described as non-inferior if the lower bound of the 95% CI of the difference in the clinically significant cancer detection rate of the cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy arm compared with the software-based fusion-targeted biopsy arm (cognitive fusion arm minus software-based arm) is higher than −10%.
The second outcomes will be analysed with 95% CI and Pearson Χ
A retrospective data review for cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy performed at our institution during 2017 showed a clinically significant cancer detection rate of 52.8%,
For the non-inferiority hypothesis, using a 10% non-inferiority margin, using 80% power and 5% one-sided α, assuming a detection rate of clinically significant cancer for cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy of 50% and a detection rate for software-based fusion-targeted biopsy of 45%, using allocation ratio of 1:1, 137 men per arm will be required. Assuming that 50% has at least one suspicious lesion on mpMRI, 548 men are needed. Account for 10% withdraw/loss, a total of 602 participants are required for inclusion.
A research nurse will record all harms or adverse events relevant or not relevant to the procedure of biopsy. Adverse events will be assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. The serious adverse events that include (1) death; (2) life-threatening; (3) hospitalisation and (4) disability or permanent damage will be recorded immediately and then sent to the ethics committee and the monitoring board within 24 hours. All harms and adverse events will be recorded from the registration to 1 week after the biopsy.
The data will be collected from the patient/relative of a patient at registration, and the medical record on 2 weeks and 6 weeks. The demographic information (age, height, weight, body mass index), PSA and family history will be recorded on registration, as well as the DRE will be performed. On 2 weeks after the registration, an MRI result will be recorded, including a PI-RADS score, prostate volume and suspicious lesion volume. Both prostate volume and suspicious lesion volume will be measured by mpMRI on the T2WI sequence. The data of pathological assessment will be recorded on 6 weeks (2 weeks post-biopsy) including an overall Gleason score and a separate Gleason score for each biopsy core. Besides, the length and per cent of tumour in each biopsy core will also be reported.
A team of independent clinical research associates (CRAs) with all more than 5 years of experience is responsible for being familiar with the trial protocol and monitoring all researchers and all participants involved in the whole processes of this trial. The CRA’s role is to (1) monitor the trial plan, the record forms and the case report form before the start of the trial; (2) monitor participants' informed consent and enrolment rates; (3) monitor the compliance of participants and investigators with the protocol, and monitor data quality and authenticity.
Ethical approval was obtained from the ethics committee of Shanghai East Hospital. The results of this study will be disseminated for international peer-reviewed journals and disseminated for presentation at international or national academic conference.

A multi-institutional phase II study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative docetaxel, cisplatin and S-1 therapy in marginally resectable advanced gastric cancer.
Patients with macroscopic type 4, large macroscopic type 3 and bulky lymph node metastasis received two cycles of preoperative docetaxel, cisplatin and S-1 therapy (docetaxel 40 mg/m
Thirty-one patients were enrolled in this study. The pathological response rate was 54.8%, and it was higher than the threshold value but lower than the expected rate. The R0 resection rate was 93.5%. The frequencies of grade 3–4 toxicities during docetaxel, cisplatin and S-1 therapy were 41.9% for neutropenia, 6.5% for febrile neutropenia and 32.3% for nausea/vomiting. Grade 2 and 3 surgical morbidities occurred in 23.3 and 6.7% of the patients, respectively.
Preoperative docetaxel, cisplatin and S-1 therapy was feasible in terms of chemotherapy-related toxicities and surgical morbidity, but the effect did not achieve the expected value. The association between the pathological response rate and survival will be evaluated in the final analysis of this clinical trial.
A phase II study of preoperative docetaxel/cisplatin/S-1 therapy for locally advanced gastric cancer was feasible, but the pathological response rate did not achieve the expected value.
Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality. An estimated 1033 700 new gastric cancer cases and 782 700 deaths occurred (
Curative resection and perioperative chemotherapy are widely accepted treatments in Europe (
Among several promising regimens, combination treatment with docetaxel, cisplatin and S-1 (DCS) had received attention for its efficacy and safety in patients with metastatic gastric cancer (
The present study evaluated the efficacy of preoperative DCS therapy. The primary endpoint was the pathological response rate (pRR), and the secondary endpoints were chemotherapy-related toxicities, morbidity and mortality as short-term outcomes and the overall and relapse-free survival as long-term outcomes. This report clarified the impact of DCS on short-term endpoints.
Tumors were staged according to the 13th edition of the Japanese Gastric Cancer Classification (
The exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) synchronous or metachronous cancer within 5 years, (ii) severe co-morbidities, (iii) pregnant or lactating woman, (iv) severe mental disease that might hinder participation in this study or (v) physician judged that the patient would be unable to complete the protocol treatment.
We adopted the DCS regimen reported by Koizumi et al. (
Chemotherapy-related toxicities were evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. The subsequent chemotherapy cycle was delayed until patient recovery, including the following parameters: WBC count ≥3000/mm
After laparotomy, intraperitoneal lavage cytology was examined. Regardless of the results of cytology, gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection was performed if macroscopic curative resection was possible without obvious residual cancer. Laparoscopic gastrectomy was not allowed, and combined resection of the surrounding organs was allowed if R0 resection was considered possible. If curative resection was considered impossible due to factors other than positive lavage cytology, the protocol treatment was terminated. Surgical morbidities were evaluated by the Clavien–Dindo classification (

Flow diagram of the present study.
This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative DCS therapy in patients with locally advanced gastric cancer. The primary endpoint was the pRR, and the secondary endpoints were chemotherapy-related toxicities, morbidity and mortality as short-term outcomes and the overall and relapse-free survival as long-term outcomes. Because the required follow-up period has not yet been reached, long-term results are premature and will be reported by 2022.
The pathological response of resected specimens was graded by a histopathologist according to the 13th edition of the Japanese classification of gastric carcinoma as follows: grade 0, no evidence of effect; grade 1a, viable tumor cells occupy ≥2/3 of the tumorous area; grade 1b, viable tumor cells remaining in ≥1/3 but <2/3; grade 2, viable tumor cells remaining in <1/3; grade 3, no viable tumor cells remaining (
The pRR of preoperative chemotherapy with CS for type 4 tumors or large type 3 tumors in JCOG 0210 and for bulky or paraaortic lymph node metastasis in JCOG 0405 were 49 and 51%, respectively (
The protocol of this study was approved by the protocol review committee of Yokohama City University (approved number: B09003120025) and each participating institution, in accordance with the ethical standards prescribed by the Helsinki Declaration. This study was registered at the University Hospital Medical Information Network (ID: UMIN000003052).
Between August 2008 and May 2016, 31 patients from three institutions were enrolled in this study.

Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 was administered to 27 of the 29 patients who underwent R0 resection. Two patients with R0 resection and 1 with R1 refused additional treatment (
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative chemotherapy with DCS in patients with marginally resectable advanced gastric cancer, including patients with type 4 tumors, larger type 3 tumors or bulky lymph node metastasis. Although the chemotherapy-related toxicities and surgical complications as secondary endpoints were feasible, the pRR as the primary endpoint was higher than the threshold value but lower than the expected rate. These results suggested that our DCS regimen was less toxic but not sufficiently effective to justify proceeding to a phase III trial.
The most likely reason why our DCS regimen failed to achieve the primary endpoint was that the total dose was insufficient. DCS regimens with higher and lower doses have been reported for unresectable advanced gastric cancer, with the higher-dose regimen being more effective but more toxic and the lower-dose regimen being less toxic (
The feasibility of two-course chemotherapy was also controversial in terms of the total dose. In this study, patients received two courses of preoperative DCS therapy. In the KDOG 1001 study, which used the same doses as this study, the overall pRR was 57.5%, but it was higher (69.5%) in patients who received four courses (
In this study, chemotherapy-related toxicities were relatively mild. In particular, the incidence of FN was 6.5%, which was similar to the results of the JCOG 1002 (5.7%) and KDOG 1001 (7.5%) trials, which used the same dosing regimen as this study (
Postoperative complications have been reported to have a negative impact on the long-term survival (
The present study was associated with some limitations. First, this was a single-arm phase II study and evaluated only early endpoints, including the pathological response, chemotherapy-related toxicities, and surgical results. Second, the pRR was determined by the pathologist at each institution and there was no central assessment. Third, the low incidence of postoperative complications may reflect the difficulty of the surgical procedure rather than the impact of the intensity of preoperative chemotherapy. In this study, none of the patients required extended lymph node dissection, even though patients with marginally resectable cancer were included.
In conclusion, preoperative DCS therapy was feasible in terms of chemotherapy-related toxicities and surgical morbidity; however, the effect did not achieve the expected value. The association between the pRR and survival will be evaluated in the final analysis of this clinical trial.

The current standard postoperative treatment for stage II-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a regimen of platinum doublet adjuvant chemotherapy. These regimens, which are the same as for solid NSCLC tumors, often cause severe adverse reactions in the treated patients. Therefore, an effective treatment regimen with fewer side effects is needed.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of S-1 monotherapy (80 mg/m
This study has been conceived to establish a superior regimen for completely resected NSCLC based on efficacy, safety and QOL.
Registry number: 
Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In order to prevent lung cancer recurrence, adjuvant chemotherapy in post-operative patients with stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been established as the standard treatment [
A recent study of the 5-year survival in a randomized phase III study of cisplatin with pemetrexed versus cisplatin with vinorelbine for completely resected stage II-IIIA non-squamous NSCLC (the JIPANG study) was reported (ASCO 2019 8501). The JIPANG study failed to show the superiority of pemetrexed plus cisplatin over vinorelbine plus cisplatin and the cost of pemetrexed is high. However, the regimen will be considered as an option for adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II-IIIA non-squamous NSCLC since the effect is comparable and the patients treated with cisplatin and pemetrexed had a higher completion rate with low adverse reactions compared to the patients treated with cisplatin and vinorelbine. Another recent approach is the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) for postoperative patients. Several clinical trials of ICI with/without chemotherapy are currently underway in adjuvant setting [
S-1 might be another candidate for mild adjuvant chemotherapy for NSCLC. The oral fluoropyrimidine derivative which consists of tegafur and two modulators, 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine (CDHP) and potassium oxonate (Oxo), enhances 5-FU efficacy by inhibiting degradation of 5-FU and reduces the GI toxicity caused by 5-FU [
Feasibility studies of S-1 based adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage IB to IIIA NSCLC have also been conducted [
The low incidence of adverse reaction directly correlates with the quality of life of the treated patients. Because of mild adverse reactions, S-1 can be administrated for outpatients without hospitalization and treated patients can continue daily life and working, which will maintain the social productivity of the treated individuals. The evaluation of quality of life (QOL) and work productivity of postoperative patients shows the advantage of S-1 chemotherapy versus standard platinum doublet adjuvant chemotherapy. Taken together, these findings have enabled us to design the current phase II study to confirm the beneficial effects of S-1 in adjuvant chemotherapy. In this article, we describe the protocol (version 2; January 14, 2020) for this study. The results of this study are expected to provide basic information for raising the precision of performance for a randomized phase III study.
The present study is a multicenter, phase II, randomized, open-labelled, parallel-group comparison study of the efficacy and safety of S-1 compared with cisplatin plus vinorelbine for adjuvant therapy in patients with NSCLC. The study design is summarized in Fig.

The study is being conducted at 30 institutions in the Lung Cancer Group in Kyusyu (LOGIK) in Japan. The study is registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (
All eligible patients will be selected and approached on the basis of information derived from the electronic health records of these 30 institutions (academic hospitals) according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants will be provided with an explanation about the study by their treating physicians, and they will be asked to voluntarily sign an informed consent before participation. If the patient’s consent is obtained, a clinical trial physician will perform the observation/examination based on the description in Fig. 
The main patient inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed in Table 
Main Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Arm A (S-1 monotherapy) is an adjuvant therapy of S-1 for 16 courses (1 year). S-1 80 mg/m
Arm B (Cisplatin with vinorelbine combination therapy) is an adjuvant therapy of cisplatin with vinorelbine for 4 courses. Cisplatin 80 mg/m
After the acquisition of written informed consent and the completion of baseline measurements, the enrolled participants are registered and assigned treatment by the registration center. Participants will be randomly allocated at a ratio of 1:1 (S1 versus Cisplatin with vinorelbine). Randomization will be performed using the block randomization method with randomly varying block length utilizing SAS version 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
This aim of this study is to estimate the 2 year relapse-free survival rate (RFS) for each study arm with sufficient clinical precision. The statistical comparison of the difference in RFS between the two arms is not a primary aim. We designed the sample size to estimate the 2-year-RFS with the accuracy determined to be the width of the 95% confidence interval for the 2 year-RFS to be less than 20%. The 2-year RFS was expected to be 65%. Assuming an estimate at the 95% confidence interval for the 2 year-RFS with the Wilson’s method, 84 patients are necessary for each arm. Estimating around 10% drop outs, we set the total number of patients to be 190. The above sample size was set to assure the statistical power to quantitatively compare the primary point between the arms. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the clinical significance of the S1 monotherapy by integrating the observed data of the RFSs, QOL and adverse events of the two arms.
Relapse-free survival was defined as the time from the date of the start of treatment to the date of disease progression or death (whichever occurs first) or the date of last contact. Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of the start of treatment to the date of death or last contact. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the time-to-event functions of relapse-free survival and overall survival. The log-rank test will be conducted as a reference without setting the significance level.
Since 2004, cisplatin with vinorelbine has been the preferred treatment for patients who have undergone complete resection of stage II to IIIA NSCLC and the recommended regimen has not been changed in more than 16 years. Because the adverse reactions are severe in the cisplatin with vinorelbine regime, the Lung Cancer Group in Kyusyu (LOGIK) is conducting the LOGIK1702 study in order to compare the efficacy of milder chemotherapy using S-1 compared to the standard regimen of cisplatin with vinorelbine. S-1 chemotherapy has been successfully used for other cancers and is recommended for intestinal adjuvant chemotherapy. In previous studies using cisplatin doublet based adjuvant chemotherapies most of the relapses occurred within 2-years following the operation and the survival curve came to a plateau thereafter [
The limitation of the present study is that this randomized study is not aimed at evaluating statistical comparison of the difference in prognoses between the two arms. Rather, this study is aimed at providing basic information for improving the performance evaluation of a future randomized phase III study. The LOGIK1702 study will give us new information on the optimal chemotherapy regimen for completely resected NSCLC.

Increasing rates of breast cancer screening have been associated with an increasing frequency of non-palpable breast lesions detection. Preoperative breast lesion localization is essential for optimizing excision accuracy. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of indocyanine green (ICG) hyaluronic acid injection as a novel mixture for localization.
We performed a prospective clinical trial with female patients who underwent surgery for non-palpable breast lesions. All patients were sequentially assigned to the control group (localization with activated charcoal), Test Group 1 (ICG-hyaluronic acid mixture 0.1 mL), or Test Group 2 (ICG-hyaluronic acid mixture 0.2 mL) by 1:1:1 ratio.
A total of 44 patients were eligible for this study (Control Group = 14, Test Group 1 = 15, Test Group 2 = 15 patients). Fibroadenoma (n = 17, 38.6%) accounted for the largest proportion of diagnoses, and five patients (11.4%) were diagnosed with malignancies. There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics among the three groups. The marking rate was over 86% in all groups, with no significant intergroup differences. Skin pigmentation was only observed in the control group. The mean accuracy of resection (the greatest diameter of the excised specimen divided by the greatest diameter of the preoperative lesion as observed using ultrasonography, with values closer to 1 reflecting a higher accuracy) was 3.7 in the control group, 2.2 in Test Group 1, and 2.1 in Test Group 2 (p = 0.037 between Controls and Test Group 1, p = 0.744 between Test Group 1 and Test Group 2, and p = 0.026 between Controls and Test Group 2).
ICG-hyaluronic acid injection is a novel method that was shown to accurately localize non-palpable breast lesions and was associated with no skin pigmentation. Further research is required to apply this method to malignant breast lesions.

Increasing rates of breast cancer screening have been associated with an increasing frequency of non-palpable breast lesion detection [
In general, there are several ways for localizing non-palpable breast lesions—for example: skin marking with a pen, wire, or tattoo. Skin marking with a pen under ultrasound (US) guidance is simple to perform, but pen markings can be easily erased and affected by a patient’s movements [
Preoperative localization of non-palpable breast lesions is essential for optimizing excision accuracy and margin distance. Indocyanine green (ICG)–hyaluronic acid (LuminoMark™) is a mixture that can be used for accurate preoperative localization with no associated skin pigmentation. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ICG-hyaluronic acid injection as a novel localization technique.
In this prospective, multi-center, open-label, parallel clinical trial (ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT03743259), we screen 50 female patients with non-palpable breast lesions who then underwent surgery at Samsung Medical Center and Myongi Hospital between January 2018 and March 2019. This study was approved by the institutional review boards of Samsung Medical Center (IRB No. 2017–10-094) and Myongi Hospital (IRB No. 2018–08-005). All patients provided written informed consent.
There were 44 eligible patients who were sequentially assigned to the control group, Test Group 1, and Test Group 2 in a 1:1:1 ratio (Fig.

The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate the safety of ICG-hyaluronic acid injection for non-palpable breast lesion localization. We defined all the harmful reactions that occurred after injection or surgery as adverse events (AEs). The primary endpoint was the accuracy of resection, which was defined as the value of the largest diameter (cm) of the excised specimen divided by the greatest diameter (cm) observed on preoperative US assessment.
Secondary endpoints were the success rate of breast lesion marking, marking on the excised specimen, histopathological accuracy, and the presence or absence of pigmentation. The breast lesion marking rate was defined as the percentage of patients identified with localized target lesions for surgery. The excised specimen marking rate was defined as the percentage of patients whose excised specimens were observed as having been stained. The histopathological accuracy was defined as the value of the largest diameter (cm) of the histopathological lesion divided by the greatest diameter (cm) of the excised specimen. Skin pigmentation was defined when pigment remnants were visible on the skin after surgery.
Patients were eligible if they had non-palpable breast lesions that could be identified by breast US, were over 19 or under 80 years of age, and agreed to participate in the trial.
Patients were ineligible if they had palpable breast lesions, were under 19 or over 80 years of age, were pregnant, had skin disease (scleroderma or systemic lupus erythematosus, for example), had a history of radiotherapy, neoadjuvant therapy, inflammatory breast cancer, or and drug (charcoal, indocyanine green, hyaluronic acid). Among 50 patients who consented to participating in the trial, six were excluded because of withdrawal of consent, cancellation of surgery, or ineligibility.
The data in this study were analyzed for differences using the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. Differences in mean values were assessed using the Mann–Whitney U test. We used SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 19. 0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). 
A total of 44 patients were eligible for this study. The control group had 14 patients and each test group had 15 patients. Table

In this prospective study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of ICG-hyaluronic acid as a novel agent for localizing non-palpable breast lesions. There were no AEs in any of the groups, and there were no significant intergroup differences in histopathological accuracy, breast lesion marking rates, or excised specimen marking rates. However, there were significant intergroup differences in resection accuracy and skin pigmentation rates.
Excised non-palpable lesions identified by localization could be larger than the excised palpable lesions. The accuracy of resection (the greatest diameter of the excised specimen divided by the greatest diameter of the preoperative lesion as detected by US) reflects the ratio of over-excision. Accuracy values closer to 1 reflect a concordance in size between the ultrasonographically defined lesion and the excised specimen. The mean accuracy value was 3.7 in control group, which was higher than the accuracy value in Test Group 1 and Test Group 2 (p = 0.037 and 0.026, respectively). These differences might have been because the injection dose of activated charcoal (0.3 to 1.0 mL) was much higher than that of the ICG-hyaluronic acid mixture (0.1 mL or 0.2 mL). If activated charcoal had been administered using the same dosage as the ICG-hyaluronic acid mixture, it would have been a proportional comparison. However, if ICG-hyaluronic acid mixture 0.3 to 1.0 mL had been used, localization would have been impossible because of the spread with blur. For the ICG-hyaluronic acid mixture injection, over 60 injections into tissue phantom models (pickle pieces in pork belly) were attempted to determine the appropriate doses and needle thicknesses. The radiologists were technically familiar with and aware of the agents used for localization. Before the implementation of this study, more than 500 breast lesion localizations with charcoal were performed annually at our center. Technical difficulties were not found in the injection of charcoal and ICG-hyaluronic acid mixture. Since a smaller resection could mean a better cosmetic result, the higher resection accuracy in the test groups relative to the control group could have reflected better cosmetic outcomes in the test groups.
Additionally, there was no difference in accuracy between Test Group 1 using 0.1 mL of ICG-hyaluronic acid mixture and Test Group 2 using 0.2 mL of ICG-hyaluronic acid (p = 0.744). Further, there were no differences in the breast lesion marking rates or excised specimen marking rates between the test groups. For localization, ICG-hyaluronic acid could be used at a dosage of either 0.1 mL or 0.2 mL.
The histopathological accuracy (the greatest diameter of the histopathological lesion divided by the greatest diameter of the excised specimen) is a unique variable in our study. Values closer to 1 reflected resections that more closely aligned with the actual histopathological lesions. There were nine cases for which histopathologic measurements were impossible; hence, the sample size was insufficient to assess efficacy in terms of this variable.
The greatest US-measured preoperative lesion diameters were mostly under 2 cm, but the longest diameter was 8 cm in one of the lesions in the control group that was later diagnosed as malignant. The diameter of the excised specimen depended on the histological result, not on the differences between the three groups, which reflects the tendency toward larger margins associated with the resection of malignant vs. benign lesions. If we analyzed only malignant lesions, we would have obtained more accurate results, but this was impossible with so few patients. Our patient group was heterogeneous because only benign lesions were included in the study, but hidden malignancies were discovered after surgery. In the future, we are planning a phase-3 clinical trial to evaluate positive margin rates among cancer patients.
In previous studies, tattooing has been used for various medical purposes [
Meanwhile, we have presented a new use for ICG-hyaluronic acid. ICG-hyaluronic acid had advantages over activated charcoal in that there was no skin pigmentation and less pain because of the smaller needle (21-gauge versus 18-gauge) used for ICG-hyaluronic acid injection. However, it had a disadvantage in that it could be visualized only via near-infrared fluorescence, so additional equipment was needed.
This study had several limitations. First, the sample size was small, and there was no long-term follow-up. Second, we used only diameter (cm) without volume (cm3 or mL), which better reflects resection margins [
This was a multicenter phase-2 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ICG-hyaluronic acid mixture for localization relative to that of activated charcoal. ICG-hyaluronic acid injection was a new method for localization and useful for obtaining accurate resection as well as cosmetic benefits. Further research is required for the method to be widely used. We have studied a small number of patients with benign breast lesions, but we need to study a larger number of patients with malignant lesions to determine the accuracy and histopathological positive margin rate of this novel method compared with other localization methods. Further research about AEs or survival rates after long-term follow-up should be considered. In the future, we are planning a phase-3 clinical trial to evaluate positive margin rates among cancer patients.

Gastrointestinal complications and malnutrition are common problems that affect postoperative rehabilitation and survival of patients with esophageal cancer. Evidence has shown that probiotics have a positive effect on improving gastrointestinal complications and nutritional status of patients with esophageal cancer after surgery, but there is a lack of prospective studies on this topic. We designed this prospective randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of probiotics on gastrointestinal complications and nutritional status in patients with postoperative esophageal cancer.
This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. It was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of our hospital. 192 patients will be randomly divided into probiotics group and the placebo group in a 1:1 ratio. After operation, probiotics and placebo will be given orally for 8 weeks. The indexes of nutritional status and incidence of digestive tract complications will be recorded and the data will be analyzed by SPSS 18.0 software.
This study will evaluate the effect of probiotics on gastrointestinal complications and nutritional status of postoperative patients with esophageal cancer. The results of this study will provide clinical basis for the use of probiotics in postoperative treatment of esophageal cancer.

As many as 80% of esophageal cancer patients are malnourished.
There are many kinds of colonizing bacteria in the human digestive tract, and these colonizing bacteria cluster together to form a colony.
Therefore, we will conduct a prospective randomized controlled study to analyze whether postoperative intake of probiotics in patients with esophageal cancer can reduce gastrointestinal complications and improve the nutritional status of patients.
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled prospective trial to study the effects of probiotics on gastrointestinal complications and nutritional status in postoperative patients with esophageal cancer. This scheme will be written according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials,

This experiment has already been registered (OSF)(registration number: DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/QHW86). We will fully inform patients and their families about the potential risks of this study. Patients or their families are required to sign a written informed consent form. Patients are free to choose whether to continue the trial at any time during the study.
All patients underwent radical resection of esophageal cancer and were confirmed by postoperative pathology.
The patient has no cognitive impairment and can communicate normally.
Patients and their families voluntarily participated in the study and signed the informed consent form.

The sample size was calculated based on the score of serum albumin six weeks after surgery. According to the results of the pilot study, the score of the probiotics group was 37.94 ± 7.15 and that of the placebo group was 34.53 ± 5.29. Set α = 0.025, one-tailed, and 
We will screen patients who meet the criteria through pre-hospital recruitment and in-hospital inpatients. 192 patients will be included in this study. Patients will randomly select any number from 001 to 192 from a sealed envelope and are assigned to the probiotic group (group A) and placebo group (group B) according to the parity of the number. Probiotics and placebo are marked “A” and “B” respectively. The probiotics are Live Combined Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus Powder (Shanghai Xinyi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. National drug license S10970105, 1 g/bag), made up of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis. The number of living bacteria per gram is not less than 1.0 × 107CFU. The placebo is made of starch, and there is no difference in appearance and smell between them.
All the patients will be operated by the same operation team. There is no obvious anastomotic fistula which is confirmed by upper gastrointestinal radiography after the operation. They can start eating. On the advice of the dietitian, the patients in the two groups will be given a liquid diet and gradually transferred to a semi-fluid diet to a normal diet. To ensure that antibiotics given after surgery do not interfere with the results of the study, patients will start taking probiotics or a placebo two weeks after surgery. The dose is 2 bags per time, 3 times a day, and infused with warm water for 8 weeks.
Nutritional status index: fasting venous blood will be taken from the two groups at 2 week, 6 weeks after operation and at the end of treatment to detect hemoglobin (Hb), serum albumin, prealbumin and total lymphocyte count, and to measure the height and weight of the two groups at two time points. Calculate body mass index, body mass index normal value > 20.0–25.0 kg/m
Complication index: anorexia, acid regurgitation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (≥3 times/d), pulmonary infection, incision infection and anastomotic leakage will be recorded during the study period.
The patients are followed up by telephone for 30 days after treatment by two assistants, and the data will be collected and recorded. The relevant information and data of this study will be collected, shared and stored in a separate storeroom to protect the confidentiality before, during and after the test. People outside this research group do not have access to relevant data.
The collected data are statistically analyzed by SPSS 18.0 software. The counting data use the chi-square test; measurement data use the mean ± standard deviation (
After operation, the gastrointestinal tract of patients with esophageal cancer is mostly in a state of hypodynamic, and up to 50% of patients will have disturbance of gastric emptying, gastric dumping syndrome, dysphagia and other phenomena, which can lead to enteral nutritional intolerance, adverse reactions such as reflux, vomiting, abdominal distension, constipation, diarrhea, and even serious complications such as aspiration pneumonia and severe malnutrition.
Some studies have pointed out that probiotics can maintain the balance of intestinal flora, reduce ectopic flora and endotoxin into the blood,
The regionalization of the study population and short follow-up time are the shortcomings of this study program. Therefore, more multi-center and long-term follow-up studies are needed to determine the effects of probiotics on postoperative patients with esophageal cancer.

Patients with polymetastatic cancer are most often treated with systemic therapy to improve overall survival and/or delay progression, with palliative radiotherapy reserved for sites of symptomatic disease. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) has shown promise in the treatment of oligometastatic disease, but the utility of SABR in treating all sites of polymetastatic disease has yet to be evaluated. This study aims to evaluate the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of SABR in patients with polymetastatic disease.
Up to 48 patients with polymetastatic cancer (> 10 sites) will be enrolled on this phase I, modified 3 + 3 design trial. Eligible patients will have exhausted (or refused) standard systemic therapy options. SABR will be delivered as an escalating number of weekly fractions of 6 Gy, starting at 6 Gy × 2 weekly fractions (dose level 1). The highest dose level (dose level 4) will be 6 Gy × 5 weekly fractions. Feasibility and safety of SABR will be evaluated 6 weeks following treatment using a composite endpoint of successfully completing treatment as well as toxicity outcomes.
This study will be the first to explore delivering SABR in patients with polymetastatic disease. SABR will be planned using the guiding principles of: strict adherence to dose constraints, minimization of treatment burden, and minimization of toxicity. As this represents a novel use of radiotherapy, our phase I study will allow for careful selection of the MTD for exploration in future studies.

In patients who have metastatic cancer, cancer which has spread beyond the primary site to other distant sites in the body [
The traditional role of radiotherapy in patients who have metastatic cancer has been for palliation of symptomatic metastases where systemic therapy does not penetrate (i.e. brain metastases) [
Recent studies have examined a subset of patients with metastatic cancer who have a limited burden of metastatic disease, known as oligometastatic cancer. The oligometastatic state is best defined as a stage of disease where a cancer has spread beyond the primary tumour to a limited number of sites, but is not yet widely metastatic [
Recent randomized trials have reported improvements in progression-free and overall survival with aggressive treatments directed at oligometastases [
In contrast to the oligometastatic state, the polymetastatic state exists beyond the oligometastatic state, where widespread dissemination of metastatic cancer has occurred (i.e. non-oligometastatic, > 10 sites of metastases) [
As a single modality, radiotherapy is associated with higher response rates compared to most systemic therapies given with palliative intent [
The toxicity of SABR may depend primarily on the doses of radiotherapy delivered to organs at risk, rather than the number of metastatic sites treated [
Given the rationale behind expansion of the oligometastatic paradigm (i.e. with the COMET-10 trial), we believe it is reasonable to postulate that the benefits of stereotactic radiotherapy may be independent of lesion number provided the treatment can be performed without excess radiation related toxicity. In this modified phase I dose escalation trial, we will test the hypothesis that SABR can be safely delivered to all sites of polymetastatic (> 10 lesions) cancer in patients for whom standard of care systemic therapies have been exhausted (or if additional systemic therapy is refused) to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD).
The objective of this trial is to assess the safety and feasibility of delivering SABR to patients with polymetastatic cancer (greater than 10 sites of disease) by establishing the MTD of SABR when given at 6 Gy per fraction.
This is a modified 3 + 3 design Phase I dose escalation trial. Participants will be from a single tertiary academic radiotherapy department in Canada. Three patients will initially be treated at dose level 1, 12 Gy in 2 fractions over 2 weeks, with evaluation of toxicity occurring 6 weeks after completion of treatment. If the composite co-primary endpoints are met, subsequent dose escalations will be accomplished by increasing the number of 6 Gy weekly fractions up to a maximum dose level of 30 Gy in 5 fractions over 5 weeks (Fig. 
Schema of the ARREST clinical trial. The initial dose level will be 6 Gy in 2 weekly fractions, with subsequent dose escalations to be achieved by increasing the number of weekly fractions for each dose level until the maximum dose level of 6Gy in 5 weekly fractions is achieved. DLT will be assessed 6 weeks after completion of radiotherapy
For a given patient, safety of treatment at a given dose level will be determined by meeting all of the following criteria:

The patient successfully receives all treatment at the assigned dose level
No Grade 5 toxicity (patient death) attributable to treatment occurs.
No Grade 4 toxicity (CTCAE v4.0) at the 6-week assessment among hematologic, cardiac, hepatobiliary or respiratory domains.
No more than three instances of Grade 3–4 toxicities among other domains.


The patient is successfully able to be planned at the assigned dose level.

Serious medical comorbidities precluding radiotherapy. These include interstitial lung disease in patients receiving lung radiotherapy, Chron’s disease in patients where the gastrointestinal tract will receive radiotherapy, ulcerative colitis where the bowel will receive radiotherapy, or connective tissue disorders such as lupus or scleroderma.
For patients with liver metastases, moderate/severe liver dysfunction (Child Pugh B or C)
Inadequate baseline bone marrow function (i.e. symptomatic anemia, neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia which may interfere with the ability to deliver radiotherapy)
Chronic kidney dysfunction (eGFR less than 30) where a significant dose of radiation is expected to be delivered to the kidneys.
Substantial overlap with a previously treated radiation volume. Prior radiotherapy in general is allowed, as long as the composite plan meets dose constraints herein. For patients treated with radiation previously, biologically effective dose calculations should be used to equate previous doses to the tolerances doses listed in Additional file 
Prior treatment with systemic radiopharmaceuticals (i.e. Radium-223 or Lutetium-177)
Any single lesion greater than 5 cm in size.
More than 50 metastases (count excluding equivocal lesions < 5 mm in size)

Evidence of epidural disease on baseline imaging.
Clinical or radiologic evidence of spinal cord compression.
Dominant brain metastasis requiring surgical decompression.
Inability to treat all sites of disease, which may include disease involving the gastrointestinal tract, mesenteric lymph nodes, or skin. This may also include diffuse/miliary metastatic disease (i.e. brain, bone, lung, liver) or other sites where it would be impossible to deliver radiotherapy at the intended dose level (i.e. lymphangitic spread, malignancy pleural effusion/ascites, leptomeningeal metastases).
Systemic therapy use 2 weeks prior to radiotherapy delivery.

All study data will be entered electronically into REDCap. Any de-identified source documents may be uploaded directly into REDCap for data entry and analysis.
SABR in will be delivered with three major guiding principles:

None
None
None
The fraction size throughout the study will remain at 6 Gy per fraction with dose constraints as outlined in Additional file 
Dose level 0: 6Gy × 1 fraction to all sites in 1 week.
Dose level 1: 6Gy × 2 fractions to all sites in 2 weeks.
Dose level 2: 6Gy × 3 fractions to all sites in 3 weeks.
Dose level 3: 6Gy × 4 fractions to all sites in 4 weeks.
Dose level 4: 6Gy × 5 fractions to all sites in 5 weeks.
If treatment at the accrued dose level cannot be planned safely, then the next lowest dose level will be attempted to be planned and delivered to the patient if it can meet organ at risk (OAR) constraints and target coverage goals. For example, if radiation cannot safely be planned at dose level 1, then dose level 0 will be attempted to be planned. For higher dose levels, multiple de-escalations can be planned until a dosimetrically safe plan is generated.
The maximum number of targets will be 50, excluding indeterminate lesions. For patients with lymph node metastases, a targetable lesion will be considered as a lymph node > 10 mm in short axis or with radiographic features strongly suspicious for metastatic involvement (i.e. presence of necrosis, uptake of radiotracer in PET). Lung metastases will be considered for treatment when the short axis is > 8 mm or radiographic features are strongly suspicious for metastatic involvement (i.e. uptake of radiotracer in PET).
Targets which have previously been treated with ablative or palliative therapies (i.e. SABR, palliative radiotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, or surgery) shall not be counted unless there is unequivocal progression on baseline imaging.
Patients who have small indeterminate nodules (i.e. a 3 mm lung nodule) will not have these lesions count towards the number of target lesions and will not be targeted with SABR.
Patients will be simulated using a fast helical CT scan through the entire body, at minimum vertex of the skull to the mid femur. If there is disease below the lesser trochanter, a separate CT simulation of the lower extremities (from the top of femoral head to the bottom of the feet) will be used for treatment planning. Immobilization will be with a thermoplastic shell with arms down, a position that has been shown to be safe for lung radiotherapy [
An additional 4D-CT scan is mandatory for targets within the thorax and upper abdomen. Where indicated and tolerable, gating (preferably with a wide duty cycle) or deep inspiration breath hold will be utilized for respiratory motion management in the thorax and upper abdomen. In cases where gating or DIBH are not tolerable, a free breathing delivery will be utilized with appropriate internal target volume (ITV) margins to account for respiratory movement.
The number of isocentres should be kept to a minimum, and it is suggested to utilize a single isocentre per body region whenever possible using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to allow simultaneous treatment of multiple lesions. However, treatment using multiple isocentres is permitted with a limit of three isocentres per treatment day (nine per fraction) if needed for optimal target coverage.
The gross tumor volume (GTV) will be defined as the visible tumor on imaging for all lesions. No additional margin will be added for microscopic spread of disease (i.e. Clinical Target Volume (CTV) = GTV), including for vertebral body metastases. For targets expected to be impacted by respiratory motion, an ITV may be created. The Planning Target Volume (PTV) will be between 2 mm and 5 mm depending on the site of disease, immobilization and set-up accuracy.
Treatment planning will be performed using the fast helical CT simulation scan, with all OARs contoured. If needed, the 4D dataset may be used for planning tumours in the thorax and abdomen (using the untagged or a subset average depending on the motion assessment). Dose constraints may not be exceeded under any circumstance. There is no prespecified conformity index to be used. No hot spots (> 115%) are allowed outside of the PTV, and hot spots greater than 115% are only permitted with an exemption from the study principal investigator.
The target coverage goals are listed in Table 
Target coverage goals for the gross tumour volume (GTV) and planning target volume (PTV) on the ARREST clinical trial
1. Failure to meet dose constraints listed in Additional file 
2. Not being able to meet minimum “Acceptable” coverage for every lesion i.e.
3. < 90% of lesions meet the “Goal” target coverage criteria
Each patient will have their treatment plan peer-reviewed by another radiation oncologist or at quality assurance rounds. The dose to each organ at risk must be verified by the treating physician or physicist to ensure doses to OARs are within acceptable limits. Dose delivery for VMAT or IMRT treatment plans will be confirmed prior to treatment by medical physics.
Given the large volume irradiated, pre-treatment with anti-emetics is mandatory for all patients on this study. The preferred treatment regimen will be ondansetron 8 mg 1–2 h prior to each radiotherapy fraction.
Patients are required to have bloodwork demonstrating adequate bone marrow function prior to delivery of the second fraction of radiotherapy, and every fraction thereafter. It is suggested this bloodwork be taken either after the last treatment of the previous level or on the first day of the next dose level, and reviewed by the treating oncologist prior to delivery of the next dose level of radiotherapy treatments. One repeat draw of bloodwork is permitted if the bloodwork values are just below the thresholds listed below. Criteria for stopping radiotherapy due to concerns of inadequate bone marrow function will be: CTCAE grade 3 anemia (hemoglobin less than 80 or symptomatic requiring a transfusion); CTCAE grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 50), CTCAE grade 3 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count less than 1).
Patients are not allowed to receive cytotoxic, immunotherapeutic or molecularly targeted agents within a time period commencing 2 weeks prior to initiation of radiotherapy until 6 weeks after completion of therapy. Patients on conventional hormone therapy (i.e. anti-estrogen or anti-testosterone therapy) may continue these medications.
Written, informed consent will be obtained from all participants prior to enrolment. A sample informed consent from may be viewed in Additional file 
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from study participation at any time. If a subject is removed from the study, an attempt should be made to obtain laboratory and clinical evaluations that would have been obtained at the completion of the study. If the subject is removed because of an adverse event, they should remain under medical care and observation by their treating physician as long as appropriate.
Patient will be seen 6 weeks post treatment to evaluate short-term treatment toxicity. If patients cannot travel for this visit (or refuse to travel), an attempt will be made to contact the patient by phone to complete follow-up information. It must be documented if follow-up information is being gathered by telephone. The FACT-G and EQ-5D-5L quality of life questionnaire will be completed at that visit. Further follow-up will be according to physician discretion; a recommended frequency would be every 3 months at minimum. Follow-up investigations will be at the physician’s discretion. While routine reimaging is not required, a follow-up CT of the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis at 3 months post-treatment or at the time of symptomatic progression is suggested.
A minimum of 3 patients will be accrued. Assuming a worst case scenario where the maximum number of patients accrued cannot be planned and require additional enrolment, a maximum of 48 patients will be accrued to this Phase I dose escalation study (12 per dose level).
For a given dose level, toxicity as DLT will be assessed after three patients have been treated at a given dose level at the 6-week assessment post treatment. If all three patients meet the co-primary safety endpoint, escalation to the next dose level will occur. If two or three patients fail the co-primary safety endpoint, the MTD will be determined as the dose level preceding the failed dose level. If one patient fails the co-primary safety endpoint, an additional three patients will be accrued at that dose level. If one or more of these additional three patients fail the co-primary safety endpoint, the MTD will be determined as the dose level preceding the failed dose level. If all three additional patients meet the co-primary safety endpoint (i.e. a cumulative five of six patients pass the co-primary safety endpoint), dose escalation to the next level will occur. All patients at a given dose level must be assessed for 6-week toxicity before escalation to the next dose level can occur.
Treatment planning futility will be considered if less than 33% of the patients (to a maximum of 9 patients) at a specific dose level can successfully have a treatment plan generated for that dose level meeting organ at risk constraints. If treatment planning futility is encountered, the MTD will be considered as the dose level preceding the failed dose level.
Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize the patient demographics on the study, distribution of lesions treated and dosimetric parameters of the treatments and toxicity experienced at 6 weeks. Progression free survival will be tracked and reported using Kaplan Meier statistics. Changes in QOL will be reported as the minimal clinically important change comparing pre and post treatment scores by patient.
The DSMC will meet annually after study initiation to review toxicity. The DSMC will review the chart of any case of grade 4–5 toxicity to determine if such toxicity is related to treatment. If the DSMC deems that toxicity rates are excessive (> 40% grade 4 toxicity, or any grade 5 toxicity), then the DSMC can, at its discretion, recommend cessation of the trial, dose adjustment, or exclusion of certain treatment sites and/or delivery techniques that are deemed as high-risk for complications.
All study participant personal health information will be kept strictly confidential. All participants will be identified using initials and a unique identification number. The master list (confidential subject identification list) linking participants to their unique identification number will be kept strictly confidential by the principal investigator. Public reports of the study will not contain any names of participants.
The trial protocol will be amended only through approval by the principal investigator (current version: 1.0, protocol date July 28, 2020). It will be the responsibility of the principal investigator to disseminate amendments to co-investigators, the research ethics board and trial registries. Authorship of the trial abstract and manuscript will be decided by the principal investigator at the time of submission.
This novel phase I trial seeks to investigate the MTD of SABR delivered to patients with polymetastatic cancer who have exhausted (or refused further standard of care) systemic therapy options. We believe that initial evaluation with a rigorous phase I trial is necessary to determine what treatment dose can be safely considered in patients with polymetastatic cancer prior to embarking on evaluation of the potential efficacy of this treatment modality.
Precedent for the treatment of extensive metastatic disease with radiotherapy exists in the experience of using hemi-body radiotherapy for palliation of diffuse bone metastases [
Further rationale for exploring SABR in the polymetastatic setting comes from emerging randomized evidence that supports aggressive radiotherapy to the primary tumour, either with SABR or conventional (chemo) radiation in patients newly diagnosed with polymetastatic prostate [
In designing this trial, we chose to evaluate dose levels in incremental fractions of 6 Gy for several reasons. First, this dose level represents familiarity in the context of hemi-body radiotherapy. While hemi-body radiotherapy has fallen out of favour due to enhancements in systemic therapy and improvements in radiopharmaceuticals, the experience of using this technique serves as the rationale behind using 6 Gy fractions of SABR. The starting dose of 12 Gy in 2 weekly fractions should also be expected to offer palliation of symptomatic metastases. Second, by escalating the number of fractions but keeping the dose per fraction consistent, an optimal radiotherapy treatment plan can be generated for the target dose level. If this optimal treatment plan does not to meet dose constraints at the target dose level, the number of fractions can be easily decreased without needing to generate a new radiotherapy plan. This allows for increased efficiency of workflow in a setting where we anticipate treatment plan generation will be resource intensive and time consuming. Third, delivering the fractions once per week allows for careful evaluation of potential, unanticipated toxicity during treatment. For example, we are carefully evaluating for the possibility of bone marrow suppression due to SABR, particularly in our chosen patient population who have exhausted (or refuse) further lines of systemic therapy and may have pre-existing myelosuppression. Finally, while the doses of SABR within this trial would not typically be considered below truly ablative doses, we believe the maximum dose level will strike an acceptable balance between anticipated efficacy, treatment intent, and potential toxicity.
Our study population was carefully considered for creation of this novel phase I trial. We chose to evaluate a subset of patients where systemic therapy use at the time of SABR is unlikely to interfere acutely with the evaluation of the MTD, as no standard systemic therapy options are available (or are refused by the patient). It is also unlikely that any toxicity from SABR in this study would interfere with the possibility of receiving subsequent systemic therapy that may become available or the patient chooses to access. However, patients enrolled on this study are expected to have been heavily pretreated with systemic therapy, which may influence secondary endpoints in our trial such as progression-free survival and overall survival. Some have argued phase I trials should be offered earlier in the treatment pathway for patients [
ARREST is a novel phase I trial leveraging the availability of modern image guided radiotherapy for the treatment of polymetastatic disease. Such treatment, if shown to be safe and tolerable, may provide additional treatment options for patients with extensive metastases who are ineligible or unwilling to undertake palliative systemic therapies.

Breast cancer, a malignant disorder, occurs in the epithelial tissue of the breast gland. Chemotherapy is the standard treatment for breast cancer, however, the side effect, especially gastrointestinal dysfunction, due to chemotherapy still remain major problems. Traditional Chinese Medicine has been proven therapeutically effective on reducing adverse effects caused by chemotherapy. Shenhuang Plaster
The study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, blind trial. A total of 160 Chinese breast cancer patients will be enrolled and randomly allocated into the experimental group and control group in a 1:1 ratio. Patients in the experimental group will be prescribed Shenhuang plaster application on shenque point (CV8) plus chemotherapy treatment. Patients in the control group will be prescribed placebo plaster application on CV8 plus chemotherapy treatment. The acupoint application will last 3 days. The primary outcome will be the form of faces every day, and the secondary outcomes the symptom score of traditional Chinese medicine, the changes of fecal bacteria and metabolites, serum motilin, gastrin and ghrelin levels.
This study is to observe therapeutic effects with Shenhuang plaster application on CV8 to regulate chemotherapy-induced gastrointestinal toxicity in breast cancer patients.

Breast cancer is cancer that occurs in the epithelial tissue of the breast gland.
Complementary alternative medicine has been widely used for a long time in cancer patients. As an important part of complementary alternative medicine , Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has formed its own unique system of theory, diagnosis and treatment system in Asian countries, especially in China. Currently, TCM has been increasingly used in the last decades, especially as an alternative treatment to chemotherapy, to improve clinical symptoms, relieve or reduce the adverse outcomes due to chemotherapy and prolong patients’ survival time. Acupoint application therapy is the application of Chinese herbal medicine to the corresponding points to regulating meridians, yin and yang, and qi as well as the blood of the human body.

Patients who are participating or were participated in other clinical trials within 1 month or are unable to provide written consent will be excluded from the trial. Patients diagnosed with primary or secondary cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, pulmonary, renal, endocrine, nerve, and hematology diseases will also be excluded from the study.
PASS software was used to estimate the sample size. In this study. According to the literature and our preliminary studies,
The experimental medicine is Shenhuang Plaster, consisting of 
Stratified block randomization will be conducted by the Zhejiang Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine with their online central randomization system. The recruitment process will be overseen by a Clinical supervisor. Each patient will be given a unique ID through a web interface provided by Clinical Data Centre of Zhejiang Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Patients will be randomly allocated to the experimental group and the control group at a ratio of 1:1 according to the ID given by the central randomization system. Each trial drug will also be labeled with a unique number and dispatched with the online system at each visit. All experimental plaster and corresponding placebo plaster are consistent in appearance and taste. The grouping information of each participant will be concealed to all research personnel and data analyzers until the end of trial. Unblinding will be permitted when serious adverse events occur.
This study will compare the experiment group with the control group. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be allocated to the experimental group or control group at a ratio of 1:1. Patients in the experimental group will receive the SHP application on CV8. Patients in the control group will receive the placebo plaster application on CV8. All patients of two groups will be treated with acupoint application once per day from the day before chemotherapy and will last 3 days. All plasters will be taken back by the experimenter to the research center after application.
The standard treatment procedures are as follows: Ensure the CV8, disinfect the application site with iodophor, allow to dry then stick the SHP or placebo plaster on the CV8 at about 8am. Each application lasts 10 hours. If patients have obviously burning sensation and severe itching, or skin redness, swelling, blisters and other discomfort, the plaster would be immediately removed the plaster and deal with corresponding treatment.
The primary outcome will be the form of faces every day. The BSFS (Bristol Stool Form Scale)
Secondary outcome measurements include the symptom score of TCM, the changes of fecal bacteria and metabolites, serum motilin, gastrin and ghrelin levels. The symptom of TCM will be assessed every day during the intervention, and other outcomes will be assessed before and after the treatment.
All adverse events will be documented during the intervention. If any adverse event occurs, it will be immediately reported and the participant will be received the corresponding treatment. We will analyze the causality to determine the severity and the relationship between the adverse events. Serious adverse events determined to be drug-induced will be reported to the ethical committee timely and discuss whether we should discontinue or modify the criteria. The trial will be allowed the unblinding after obtaining the consent of the main investigator.
The clinical data will be managed and analyzed by Clinical Data Center of Zhejiang Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Personal information about potential and enrolled participants will be collected by researchers and will updated in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry before and during the trial. SPSS V.21.0 will be used for statistical analysis. SPSS software (Version 19.0) will be used for statistical analysis. The continuous data will be expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). The categorical data will be expressed as numbers (percentages) or medians. If the P value less than 0.05 will be concerned that there is statistical significance.
Treatment of breast cancer with chemotherapy is remarkably effective, but it is associated with side effects. The disruption in the function of the intestine is a common clinically side effect. Chemotherapy-induced gastrointestinal toxicity (CIGT) is associated with a variety of clinical complications, including anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation. CIGT affected more than half of cancer which will lead to the break and/or reduction of treatments patient, and has huge clinical and economic implications. Patients who experience severe CIGT have twice the infection risk leading to a fourfold higher chance of death and threefold longer hospital stays, compromising survival and creating a burden on patients’ quality of life.
In summary, this study is a large randomized, placebo-controlled, blind trial that aims to test the SHP application on CV8 will improve the gastrointestinal side effect after chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. If the results are positive, they will provide strong evidence of the contribution of acupoint therapy to the clinical outcomes in cancer patients.

The primary objective is to demonstrate that, in patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 resulting in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), administration of 120mg/kg of body weight of intravenous Prolastin®(plasma-purified alpha-1 antitrypsin) reduces circulating plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6). Secondary objectives are to determine the effects of intravenous Prolastin® on important clinical outcomes including the incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).
Phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot trial.
The study will be conducted in Intensive Care Units in hospitals across Ireland. Patients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-infection, moderate to severe ARDS (meeting Berlin criteria for a diagnosis of ARDS with a PaO
Intervention: Either a once weekly intravenous infusion of Prolastin® at 120mg/kg of body weight for 4 weeks or a single dose of Prolastin® at 120mg/kg of body weight intravenously followed by once weekly intravenous infusion of an equal volume of 0.9% sodium chloride for a further 3 weeks. Comparator (placebo): An equal volume of 0.9% sodium chloride intravenously once per week for four weeks.
The primary effectiveness outcome measure is the change in plasma concentration of IL-6 at 7 days as measured by ELISA. Secondary outcomes include: safety and tolerability of Prolastin® in the respective groups (as defined by the number of SAEs and AEs); PaO

The incidence of malnutrition in patients with esophageal cancer is high, which seriously affects the therapeutic effect and quality of life. Oral nutritional supplement is the first choice of nutritional support recommended by current guidelines, which can supplement the lack of energy and protein in patients with esophageal cancer, improve nutritional status and improve the quality of life, but there are few clinical studies. Therefore, the purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effect of oral nutritional supplement therapy on nutritional status and quality of life in patients with esophageal cancer treated undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
This is a prospective randomized controlled trial to study the effects of oral nutritional supplement therapy on nutritional status and quality of life in patients with esophageal cancer undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This study is approved by the Clinical Research Society of our hospital. Patients will be randomly divided into ONS group and traditional diet group. The nutritional status, quality of life score and adverse reactions will be observed before and after radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The data will be analyzed by SPSS 16.0.
This study will evaluate the effect of oral nutritional supplement therapy on nutritional status and quality of life of patients with esophageal cancer undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The results of this experiment will establish clinical evidence for the application of oral nutritional supplement therapy in patients with esophageal cancer undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

About 40% to 80% of patients with malignant tumors have nutrition-related problems, which are more common in patients with head and neck tumors and digestive tract tumors,
The 2006 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) guidelines unify the English full name of ONS as “oral nutritional supplements” and define it as "supplementary oral intake of foods for special medical uses (formulations) in addition to normal foods.
This is a prospective RCT to study the effect of oral nutritional supplement therapy on nutritional status and quality of life in patients with esophageal cancer undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines for reporting randomized trials and provided a CONSORT flow diagram (Fig. 
Flow diagram.
This protocol is in line with the Helsinki Declaration and approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of our hospital. This experiment has been registered in the open science framework (OSF) (registration number: DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/9ZW34). Before randomization, all patients will sign a written informed consent. and they can freely choose whether to continue the trial at any time.
Inclusion criteria:
patients were diagnosed as esophageal cancer, without contraindications of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, planned for radiotherapy and chemotherapy;
conscious, able to eat by mouth, volunteer to participate in this clinical study;
Nutritional Risk Screening score ≥ 3 (NRS 2002).
Exclusion criteria:
patients with unstable vital signs;
patients with severe stress state, intractable vomiting, and severe diarrhea;
patients with severe malabsorption syndrome;
patients with mental or consciousness disorders that could not communicate;
unable to understand the study plan or unwilling participants after explanation.
This study will be randomized into groups without any stratification. Through simple randomization, the patients in the study will be divided into the observation group and the control group according to the 1:1 ratio. Due to the limitation of the intervention in this study, this study cannot achieve strict double-blindness. We will ensure that the study designer, allocators, data analysts, intervention supervisors, and some researchers are blind to personnel allocation.
This study is a pilot clinical trial. The calculation of the sample size is based on the withdrawal rate of 20% in the clinical study, taking 
After the beginning of the study, dietitians will give one-to-one nutrition education to the two groups of patients once a week, investigate the results of patients’ dietary intake, give nutritional guidance and formulate dietary recipes according to different conditions, and issue a diet guidance sheet for cancer patients at the same time.
In this study, patients in the control group will not be given ONS supplement. We will set up the Nutrition Support Steam to provide comprehensive nutritional care for patients in the experimental group,
The related indexes of the 2 groups will be detected before and after radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and the relevant data will be recorded.
Energy intake: the dietitian uses the 24 hours retrospective method to conduct a dietary survey once a week, including the type and quantity of diet. The daily energy intake is calculated according to the Chinese Food composition Table 2002, and the body mass is measured once a week.
Hematological determination: the levels of leukocyte, hemoglobin, platelet, total protein, albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin were detected after fasting venous blood collection.
Quality of life assessment: SF-36 score (the MOS item short from health survey).
Adverse reactions: The evaluation of adverse reactions refers to the Evaluation criteria of Common adverse events of the National Cancer Institute of the United States.
Nutrition intervention will run through the whole process of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. According to the outcome indicators, the data before radiotherapy and chemotherapy, every two weeks after the beginning of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and after radiotherapy and chemotherapy are collected. All data will be collected by an assistant, and recorded in detail in the predesigned table. All the research data will be stored in a separate window, and only the researchers of this research group can access the relevant research data.
The data will be statistically analyzed by SPSS 16.0. The counting data will be expressed by rate, 
Nutritional support has become an important part of tumor treatment. Ideal nutritional support should be based on the accurate assessment of the nutritional status of patients. ONS is a kind of nutrition supplement for special medical purpose, which can increase the intake of energy and nutrients. It is economical, convenient and easy to be accepted by patients.
Radiation esophagitis, dysphagia, and pain often occur in patients with esophageal cancer after radiotherapy, and malnutrition affects the course of treatment.
Although studies have confirmed that ONS can supplement the lack of energy and protein in patients with esophageal cancer, maintain and increase the weight of patients, improve nutritional status, and improve the quality of life,
This study also has the following limitations: due to the factors of intervention, researchers and patients cannot strictly achieve double-blind, there may be a certain bias; there is a regional population included in this study, which may have a certain impact on the results.

To assess the impact of adding statin (atorvastatin) and/or aspirin on clinical deterioration in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who require hospitalisation. The safety of these drugs in COVID-19 patients will also be evaluated.
This is a single-centre, prospective, four-arm parallel design, open-label, randomized control trial.
The study will be conducted at National Cancer Institute (NCI), Jhajjar, Haryana, which is a part of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, and has been converted into a dedicated COVID-19 management centre since the outbreak of the pandemic. All RT-PCR confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection with age ≥ 40 years and < 75 years requiring hospital admission (patients with WHO clinical improvement ordinal score 3 to 5) will be included in the trial. Written informed consent will be taken for all recruited patients. Patients with a critical illness (WHO clinical improvement ordinal score > 5), documented significant liver disease/dysfunction (aspartate transaminase [AST] / alanine aminotransferase [ALT] > 240), myopathy and rhabdomyolysis (creatine phosphokinase [CPK] > 5x normal), allergy or intolerance to statins or aspirin, prior statin or aspirin use within 30 days, history of active gastrointestinal bleeding in past three months, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100000/ dl), pregnancy, active breastfeeding, or inability to take oral or nasogastric medications will be excluded. Patients refusing to give written consent and taking drugs that are known to have a significant drug interaction with statin or aspirin [including cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors, hepatitis C protease inhibitor, telaprevir, fibric acid derivatives (gemfibrozil), niacin, azole antifungals (itraconazole, ketoconazole), clarithromycin and colchicine] will also be excluded from the trial.
In this study, the benefit and safety of atorvastatin (statin) and/or aspirin as adjuvant therapy will be compared with the control group receiving usual care for management of COVID-19. Atorvastatin will be prescribed as 40 mg oral tablets once daily for ten days or until discharge, whichever is earlier. The dose of aspirin will be 75 mg once daily for ten days or until discharge, whichever is earlier. All other therapies will be administered according to the institute’s COVID-19 treatment protocol and the treating physician’s clinical judgment.
All study participants will be prospectively followed up for ten days or until hospital discharge, whichever is longer for outcomes. The primary outcome will be clinical deterioration characterized by progression to WHO clinical improvement ordinal score ≥ 6 (i.e., endotracheal intubation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, pressor agents, renal replacement therapy, ECMO requirement, and mortality). The secondary outcomes will be change in serum inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and Interleukin-6), Troponin I, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) from time zero to 5th day of study enrolment or 7th day after symptom onset, whichever is later. Other clinical outcomes that will be assessed include progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), shock, ICU admission, length of ICU admission, length of hospital admission, and in-hospital mortality. Adverse drug effects like myalgia, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, hepatotoxicity, and bleeding will also be examined in the trial to assess the safety of the interventions.
The study will use a four-arm parallel-group design. A computer-generated permuted block randomization with mixed block size will be used to randomize the participants in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to group A (atorvastatin with conventional therapy), group B (aspirin with conventional therapy), group C (aspirin + atorvastatin with conventional therapy), and group D (control; only conventional therapy).
The study will be an open-label trial.
As there is no existing study that has evaluated the role of aspirin and atorvastatin in COVID-19 patients, formal sample size calculation has not been done. Patients satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited during six months of study period. Once the first 200 patients are included in each arm (i.e., total 800 patients), the final sample size calculation will be done on the basis of the interim analysis of the collected data.

The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoid infusion pulse therapy to improve the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with elevated inflammatory biomarkers.
A parallel-group quadruple-blind (participant, intervention provider, outcome assessor and data manager), randomised controlled trial.
All patients admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 pneumonia will be considered eligible. Potential candidates will be identified and consecutively included in the emergency room or in the COVID-19 admission wards of two hospitals in Spain: Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra (Pamplona) and Hospital Moisès Broggi (Sant Joan Despí, Barcelona).
Inclusion criteria are: 1) age ≥18 years old; 2) diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum in accordance with the recommendations of the Spanish Ministry of Health; 3) history of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 ≥7 days; 4) hospital admission; 5) at least one of the following: C-reactive protein (CRP) >60 mg/dL, interleukin-6 (IL-6) >40 pg/mL, and/or ferritin >1000 μg/L; and 6) provision of informed consent.
Exclusion criteria are: 1) allergy or contraindication to any of the drugs under study; 2) oxygen saturation (SpO
   
Eligible patients will be randomised to receive standard of care plus methylprednisolone (intervention group) or standard of care plus placebo (control group). 
   
Intervention group: standard of care at the discretion of the researcher, including lopinavir/ritonavir (200/50 mg, 2 tablets twice daily, per os, for 7 to 14 days) ± remdesivir (a single intravenous loading dose of 200 mg on day 1 followed by once-daily intravenous maintenance doses of 100 mg from day 2 to 5), or no drug treatment, + methylprednisolone (once-daily intravenous infusion of 120 mg on days 1, 2 and 3).
Control group: standard of care at the discretion of the researcher, including lopinavir/ritonavir (200/50 mg, 2 tablets every 12 hours, per os, for 7 to 14 days) ± remdesivir (a single intravenous loading dose of 200 mg on day 1 followed by once-daily intravenous maintenance doses of 100 mg from day 2 to 5), or no drug treatment, + placebo (once-daily intravenous infusion of 100 mL of 0.9% saline on days 1, 2 and 3).
The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with treatment failure at 14 days after randomisation, defined as: 1) death, 2) need for admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), 3) initiation of mechanical ventilation, 4) SpO
   
Treatment will be allocated by block randomisation stratified by patient age (< or ≥ 75 years of age). For this purpose, we will use the R randomizeR package using two block sizes (4 and 6) with random permutation. The randomisation sequence will be generated by a unit (the Navarrabiomed Clinical Trials Platform) independent from the researchers who will recruit patients and implement the protocol.
The study will be quadruple-blinded, specifically, with blinding of patients, intervention providers, outcome assessors and data managers. The pharmacy at each participating hospital will prepare indistinguishable bags of methylprednisolone or placebo (0.9% saline) for patients of the experimental and placebo groups, respectively.
The percentage of patients with treatment failure (primary endpoint) is currently unknown. Assuming an absolute difference of 25% in the primary outcome between the two groups (35% in the control group and 10% in the intervention group), we estimate that 60 patients (30 per group) are required to detect this difference with a two-tailed type I error of 0.05 and a type II error of 0.2. Estimating a loss to follow-up of 20%, we should recruit a total sample size of 72 patients (36 per group).
The Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices (AEMPS) and the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital La Princesa approved version 7.0 of the protocol on 30 April 2020 as a low intervention clinical trial. Subsequently, the protocol has been amended by researchers and re-approved by AEMPS and the same ethics committee on 1 July 2020 (version 8.0) and on 28 August 2020 (version 9.0).

The classical pathway for diagnosing prostate cancer is systematic 12-core biopsy under the guidance of transrectal ultrasound, which tends to underdiagnose the clinically significant tumour and overdiagnose the insignificant disease. Another pathway named targeted biopsy is using multiparametric MRI to localise the tumour precisely and then obtain the samples from the suspicious lesions. Targeted biopsy, which is mainly divided into cognitive fusion method and software-based fusion method, is getting prevalent for its good performance in detecting significant cancer. However, the preferred targeted biopsy technique in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer between cognitive fusion and software-based fusion is still beyond consensus.
This trial is a prospective, single-centre, randomised controlled and non-inferiority study in which all men suspicious to have clinically significant prostate cancer are included. This study aims to determine whether a novel three-dimensional matrix positioning cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy is non-inferior to software-based fusion-targeted biopsy in the detection rate of clinically significant cancer in men without a prior biopsy. The main inclusion criteria are men with elevated serum prostate-specific antigen above 4–20 ng/mL or with an abnormal digital rectal examination and have never had a biopsy before. A sample size of 602 participants allowing for a 10% loss will be recruited. All patients will undergo a multiparametric MRI examination, and those who fail to be found with a suspicious lesion, with the anticipation of half of the total number, will be dropped. The remaining participants will be randomly allocated to cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy (n=137) and software-based fusion-targeted biopsy (n=137). The primary outcome is the detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer for cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy and software-based fusion-targeted biopsy in men without a prior biopsy. The clinically significant prostate cancer will be defined as the International Society of Urological Pathology grade group 2 or higher.

The trial protocol will be amended only through approval by the principal investigator (current version: 1.0, protocol date July 28, 2020). It will be the responsibility of the principal investigator to disseminate amendments to co-investigators, the research ethics board and trial registries. Authorship of the trial abstract and manuscript will be decided by the principal investigator at the time of submission.
All adverse events will be documented during the intervention. If any adverse event occurs, it will be immediately reported and the participant will be received the corresponding treatment. We will analyze the causality to determine the severity and the relationship between the adverse events. Serious adverse events determined to be drug-induced will be reported to the ethical committee timely and discuss whether we should discontinue or modify the criteria. The trial will be allowed the unblinding after obtaining the consent of the main investigator.
The primary objective is to demonstrate that, in patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 resulting in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), administration of 120mg/kg of body weight of intravenous Prolastin®(plasma-purified alpha-1 antitrypsin) reduces circulating plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6). Secondary objectives are to determine the effects of intravenous Prolastin® on important clinical outcomes including the incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).

Intervention: Either a once weekly intravenous infusion of Prolastin® at 120mg/kg of body weight for 4 weeks or a single dose of Prolastin® at 120mg/kg of body weight intravenously followed by once weekly intravenous infusion of an equal volume of 0.9% sodium chloride for a further 3 weeks. Comparator (placebo): An equal volume of 0.9% sodium chloride intravenously once per week for four weeks.
The primary effectiveness outcome measure is the change in plasma concentration of IL-6 at 7 days as measured by ELISA. Secondary outcomes include: safety and tolerability of Prolastin® in the respective groups (as defined by the number of SAEs and AEs); PaO
   
Following informed consent/assent patients will be randomised. The randomisation lists will be prepared by the study statistician and given to the unblinded trial personnel. However, the statistician will not be exposed to how the planned treatment will be allocated to the treatment codes. Randomisation will be conducted in a 1:1:1 ratio, stratified by site and age.
The investigator, treating physician, other members of the site research team and patients will be blinded to treatment allocation. The clinical trial pharmacy personnel and research nurses will be unblinded to facilitate intervention and placebo preparation. The unblinded individuals will keep the treatment information confidential. The infusion bag will be masked at the time of preparation and will be administered via a masked infusion set to maintain blinding.
A total of 36 patients will be recruited and randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to each of the trial arms.
