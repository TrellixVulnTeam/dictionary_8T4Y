Also, due to the characteristics of our study based on Lin- cells injection, the experiment was conducted only in ALS patients, lacking a control group. Overall, this study was not designed, nor was large enough, to determine the efficacy of slowing or stopping the progression of ALS. In addition, the clinical progression in ALS is highly variable, and the biological factors accounting for this variability are still unknown. Therefore, for proper reasoning, we divided the study cohort arbitrary into two separated groups, which included only six participants, related to their clinical outcomes, further limiting our ability to make any conclusive statements about the therapeutic efficacy of the Lin- cells transplantation. We could only observe in these small groups the changes in molecular expression of selected proteins and miRNAs. Nevertheless, we must be cautious about ascribing the cause and effect of the performed intervention to the ALS patients recruited to the study.

Lin- cells intrathecal injection appeared to be a safe and well-tolerated procedure without transient or chronic adverse events. Therefore, with proper enrollment criteria and repeated cell applications, it may be possible to sustain their potentially beneficial effects, thus causing a gradual decrease or stop in ALS progression. Despite the variation in individual response arising, inter alia, due to different stages of the disease during enrollment, our preliminary results suggest that single intrathecal injection of bone marrow-derived early hematopoietic cells may cause some positive changes in various cytokines concentrations. Furthermore, our findings showed consistent miRNA expression profiles in the CSF and blood plasma, providing some presumable links between miRNA expression and the effects on the disease pathology; however, this needs further clarification. These data suggest that miR-206 or miR-133a in the CSF may also have a specific protective function at the synapse in ALS, where denervation occurs following motor neuron cell death.

We demonstrated that the GnRH vaccine, GonaCon-Equine, could be an effective immunocontraceptive for free-ranging feral horses, particularly when the primary vaccination is followed by reimmunization four years later. This vaccine was shown to be safe for pregnant females and neonates and did not result in deleterious behavioral side effects during the foaling/breeding season. The only adverse reactions to vaccination were non-debilitating inflammatory responses at injection sites. One noteworthy implication has emerged regarding long-term management of free-ranging horse populations using GonaCon-Equine vaccine: effective management and development of population models will need to incorporate repeat immunizations of this vaccine to optimize management strategies aimed at stabilizing the growth rate of feral horse populations. Our research suggests that practical application of this vaccine in feral horses will require an initial inoculation that may provide only modest suppression of fertility followed by reimmunization over time that together could result in greater reduction in population growth rates. Future research will begin to define the most effective revaccination schedule with GonaCon-Equine for suppressing reproductive rates in free-ranging horses, the duration of effectiveness, and the return to fertility following treatment. Moreover, applying GonaCon-Equine to control the growth of feral horse populations will require that resource managers choose specific tactics for treating animals. Choices must be made on the number and age to treat and the frequency of treatment needed to maintain the desired population age structure and genetic diversity. Decisions on the most beneficial tactics will depend on overarching management goals and long-term objectives for the population.","[GnRH, GonaCon-Equine, four years later, One, GonaCon-Equine, GonaCon-Equine, GonaCon-Equine]","['PRODUCT', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'CARDINAL', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG']","[227, 241, 402, 689, 799, 1410, 1583]","[231, 255, 418, 692, 813, 1424, 1597]",False

This study showed that sertraline exposure decreased bone healing with significant declines in Tb.Th and Tb.N, independent of specific circulating serum sertraline levels, suggesting a possible on/off mechanism of action for sertraline’s effect on bone healing instead of a dose-dependent effect. While increased Tb.Sp coupled with significantly decreased Tb.N and Tb.Th after sertraline exposure support the decreased percent healing and bone volume observed in the sertraline-exposed groups, these significant differences did not lead to a corresponding significant decline in either factor. This disparity seems to indicate that, while the overall bone volume was not significantly affected by sertraline, the organization of the regenerated bone was severely hampered, with sertraline exposure causing the regenerating bone to be organized in thin, widely spaced trabeculae. Subsequently, histological analysis of the regenerate within the defect site showed increased amounts of disjoined woven bone with a lack of continuous bone regrowth after sertraline exposure. Bone organized in such a fashion would be unlikely to support a load, increasing the mobility within the defect site and therefore requiring an alternative healing pathway to accommodate such displacement.",[],[],[],[],False

We described significant changes in EEG power reflected in a normalization of the EEG spectral characteristics by 12 months post‐infusion. Furthermore, higher baseline EEG beta 2 power was associated with a greater degree of improvement in social communication symptoms. Baseline measures of EEG beta 2 power and NVIQ together were highly predictive of treatment response, highlighting the potential for EEG as a tool to discriminate between children with varying degrees of improvement after treatment with autologous umbilical cord blood. These outcomes will be further evaluated on completion of the ongoing randomized phase II, placebo‐controlled study of cord blood in young children with ASD.","[EEG, ASD, EEG, EEG, 12 months, EEG, 2, Baseline, EEG, 2, EEG, II, ASD]","['ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'CARDINAL', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'CARDINAL', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG']","[41, 168, 209, 255, 287, 341, 350, 444, 465, 474, 577, 801, 867]","[44, 171, 212, 258, 296, 344, 351, 452, 468, 475, 580, 803, 870]",False

CR rates matched historical controls; however, low rate of relapse and a suggestion of a favorable OS observed in the current study suggest that the antileukemia effect of glasdegib may be primarily mediated through the elimination of AML stem cells.

Our simulations predict that the overall treatment effect is maintained for most patients, even if the TKI dose is reduced. Based on their initial treatment response under full dose, we identify patients who most likely benefit from a reduction scheme and present a strategy to estimate a patient-specific, optimal dose. Our results suggest a treatment strategy that could considerably reduce cumulative drug intake and, therefore, decrease drug-mediated side-effects. It might also increase compliance of patients to adhere to the prescribed treatment schedule. On the population level, the long overall survival times of continuously treated CML-patients add a distinct economical aspect to the outlined strategy, as the high treatment costs could be substantially reduced.","[CML, TKI, TKI, TKI, CML]","['ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG']","[108, 251, 287, 491, 1032]","[111, 254, 290, 494, 1035]",False

The hypothesis of the maintenance randomisation was that lenalidomide treatment could improve progression-free survival and overall survival compared with observation in adult patients with multiple myeloma. For progression-free survival, the trial was designed to demonstrate a 6·7-month increase in median progression-free survival in the lenalidomide group (median 26·7 months) compared with the observation group (median 20·0 months, hazard ratio [HR] 0·75) when 509 progression-free survival events had been observed. For overall survival, it was designed to demonstrate a 10% increase in 5-year overall survival in the lenalidomide group (60% at 5 years) compared with the observation group (50% at 5 years, HR 0·74) when 458 overall survival events had been observed.
