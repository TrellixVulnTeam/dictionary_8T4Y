For some patients (ie, those with highest-risk disease, insufficient stem cell numbers after mobilization, or bone marrow involvement) allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) offers the potential for cure. However, the majority of patients undergoing alloHCT receive reduced-intensity conditioning as a preparative regimen, and studies assessing outcomes of patients after alloHCT with myeloablative conditioning are limited. In this retrospective study, we reviewed outcomes of 22 patients with recurrent and refractory NHL who underwent alloHCT with myeloablative BEAM conditioning and received tacrolimus/sirolimus as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis at City of Hope between 2005 and 2018. With a median follow-up of 2.6 years (range, 1.0 to 11.2 years), the probabilities of 2-year overall survival and event-free survival were 58.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 35.0% to 75.8%) and 45.5% (95% CI, 24.4% to 64.3%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of grade II to IV acute GVHD was 45.5% (95% CI, 23.8% to 64.9%), with only 1 patient developing grade IV acute GVHD.
