The currently available therapies, idursulfase and idursulfase beta, are ineffective against the CNS symptoms because they cannot pass the blood-brain barrier (BBB). A novel IDS fused with anti-human transferrin receptor antibody (JR-141) has been shown to penetrate the BBB and ameliorate learning deficits in model mice. This first-in-human study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety, and potential efficacy of JR-141 in 14 patients with MPS II. In a dose-escalation study performed in two patients, JR-141 plasma concentrations were dose dependent and peaked at 3&#x000a0;hr after initiation of each infusion, and no or only mild adverse reactions were exhibited. In a subsequent 4-week evaluation at two dose levels, the plasma concentration profiles were similar between the first and final administration, indicating no drug accumulation. Levels of heparan sulfate (HS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) were suppressed in both plasma and urine and HS levels were significantly decreased in cerebrospinal fluid. Two patients experienced some amelioration of neurocognitive and motor symptoms. These results suggest that the drug successfully penetrates the BBB and could have CNS efficacy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser" id="abs0015"><p>Okuyama et&#x000a0;al. report on a first-in-human study of iduronate-2-sulfatase fused with anti-human transferrin receptor antibody (JR-141) in 14 patients with mucopolysaccharidosis II to evaluate its pharmacokinetics, safety, and potential efficacy.

In part 2, one patient felt throat irritation and developed a transient rash during the first administration of JR-141 (1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg). Two patients experienced transient urticaria, one after the second administration and the other after the fourth (2.0&#x000a0;mg/kg). Mild to moderate pyrexia was also observed in the same two patients, but it abated quickly. One patient showed transient hypohaptoglobinemia after the final administration (1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg). More than 4&#x000a0;weeks after the completion of the study, one patient with a comorbid diagnosis of epilepsy became delirious after being prescribed a new antiepileptic; this patient was admitted to hospital for observation, hence the episode classified as a serious adverse event. Although the delirium abated after discontinuation of the new antiepileptic, we did not feel able to conclude that this episode was completely unrelated to the administration of JR-141. Overall, however, these results indicate that four administrations of JR-141 at a dosage of as high as 2.0&#x000a0;mg/kg/week are safe and well tolerated.</p><p id="p0055">Prior to the initiation of the study, serum HS and DS levels were near normal in all patients because they were receiving idursulfase, which reduces GAG accumulation in the peripheral tissues.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Their HS and DS levels remained substantially unchanged throughout the study period (i.e., after JR-141 administration; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A).

Although a treatment period of 4&#x000a0;weeks is too short to render these results conclusive, they nonetheless may suggest potential non-inferiority of JR-141 to idursulfase in reducing GAG accumulation in the peripheral tissues.</p><p id="p0060">To evaluate the effects of JR-141 on neurodegeneration in MPS II, we measured the concentrations of HS and DS in CSF as biomarkers of neurodegeneration in all subjects before we initiated JR-141 administration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>).

Notably, weekly intravenous administrations of JR-141 for 3&#x000a0;weeks reduced HS concentrations in the CSF of all patients. The values of HS in CSF before JR-141 administration were 4,615&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1,559&#x000a0;ng/mL (n&#x000a0;= 6, mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1; SD) in the low-dose group (1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg/week), and 5,168&#x000a0;&#x000b1; 1,698&#x000a0;ng/mL (n&#x000a0;= 5, mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1; SD) in the high-dose group (2.0&#x000a0;mg/kg/week).

It also suggested, despite the short treatment period of 4&#x000a0;weeks, that JR-141 seems to be no less effective than conventional enzyme replacement therapy with idursulfase in reducing GAG concentrations in the plasma and urine, which needs to be established through a longer treatment period. Importantly, JR-141 markedly decreased HS levels in the CSF of our patients with MPS II, which remained elevated after they had been treated with idursulfase prior to this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of significant drug delivery across the BBB to address neurodegeneration in patients with MPS II.</p><p id="p0080">Hendriksz et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> have shown a correlation between HS concentrations in CSF and intellectual disability in MPS II patients. Intellectual disability is known to develop in patients with MPS I, II, III, or VII,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> all of which are associated with HS accumulation in the CNS, but not in patients with the forms of MPS that do not involve HS accumulation (MPS IV and VI). Impaired metabolism of HS leads to secondary accumulation of gangliosides that results in various CNS defects via multiple mechanisms, including tau protein hyperphosphorylation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and increased autophagy.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Therefore, HS accumulation should be regarded as a critical etiological factor in the development of CNS disorders in patients with MPS, and normalization of HS clearance in the CNS should prevent, or at least curb, the progression of neurodegeneration. In other words, HS levels in CSF are not only an informative clinical surrogate endpoint in the evaluation of efficacy of therapeutics for neurodegeneration but may also be helpful for clinical understanding of neurocognitive deficits if they correspond well to the intracellular and lysosomal HS levels, both critical for neurotoxicity.</p><p id="p0085">Conventional enzyme replacement therapy with idursulfase for MPS II is ineffective against CNS disorders, because the enzyme cannot penetrate the brain through the BBB. Managing these disorders has, therefore, been a frustration in clinical practice and has left neuropathic MPS in something of a therapeutic impasse.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Efforts have been made to improve enzyme delivery to the brain by way of intrathecal<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> or intracerebroventricular<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> administration, but these efforts have reportedly had very limited success in achieving sufficient brain penetration.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref></p><p id="p0090">In contrast to these approaches, delivery of IDS to the brain by JR-141 is achieved via the mechanism of receptor-mediated transcytosis of transferrin.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> TfRs are expressed in brain capillary endothelial cells, a component of the BBB, which enables transferrin to cross the BBB.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> We assume that JR-141 binds to TfR on the endothelial cells through the anti-TfR antibody region of the drug and is then transported into the cells and distributed in the brain parenchyma by as-yet-unidentified mechanisms, which prevent the neurotoxic accumulation of HS in the neurons. We have previously reported the penetration of human IDS fused with an engineered monoclonal antibody against murine TfRs into the brain parenchyma of MPS II model mice, which resulted in reductions in HS concentration in the brain, along with improvements in learning and memory.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> These findings were then neatly replicated with human IDS with monoclonal antibody against human TfRs administered to human TfR-knockin mice and monkeys.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> The HS concentrations in the mouse CSF correlated well with those in the mouse brain,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> which justifies the use of HS concentrations as a biomarker reflecting neuropathological disease activities in MPS II, as discussed above. These preclinical findings further reinforce the positioning of HS concentrations in CSF both as a viable efficacy endpoint in clinical trials evaluating treatment response and also as a direct biomarker of ongoing neurodegeneration. Clinical pictures of CNS disorders in MPS II are too multifaceted and varied to allow a truly viable clinical efficacy endpoint to be established in the face of diverse disease progression and severity, as well as the paucity of evaluable patient populations worldwide for participation in clinical trials.</p><p id="p0095">Although this study was merely for 4&#x000a0;weeks and not designed to establish the efficacy of JR-141 via clinically validated measures, it may be noteworthy that two of the investigators reported some brief motor and behavioral changes in their respective patients. One 16-year-old patient in the low-dose group was reported to have learned to skip, an activity he had never attempted before, while the other, a 14-year-old in the high-dose group, showed improved gait, continence, sleep, and responsiveness toward those around him. There were notable reductions in CSF HS level from 5,840 to 3,650&#x000a0;ng/mL in the former, 8,940 to 2,720&#x000a0;ng/mL in the latter. These improvements all disappeared several weeks after administration of the test drug ceased, as documented in the patients&#x02019; medical records. Albeit merely anecdotal, these clinical observations may be useful for future clinical trials in monitoring subtle neurocognitive and behavioral changes that can be easily overlooked.</p><p id="p0100">This study has several limitations. First, because MPS II is a rare disease, the number of patients available to participate was extremely limited, leading to an inevitable lack of statistical power. In addition, the marked heterogeneity of the sample population further limits the generalizability of the study results. Second, no neurocognitive or neurodevelopmental assessments were made, because we considered the limited treatment period of 4&#x000a0;weeks too short for any such assessments to be worthwhile. However, the aforementioned clinical observations of brief neurocognitive and motor changes even in the short period during which JR-141 was administered suggest that the drug may show salient efficacy in treating CNS disorders when administered on a long-term basis. Late-phase clinical trials are planned to investigate this. Third, the CSF levels of JR-141 were below the detection limit for pharmacokinetic measurement. This may have been because the timing of CSF sampling was too late to detect the drug before it was eliminated or because JR-141 was so swiftly and efficiently transported into the neurons after penetrating the BBB that too little was left in the CSF to measure. Nevertheless, the significant reductions in HS levels in the CSF of all patients following JR-141 administration are, we believe, robust evidence of the successful delivery of the drug to the CNS.</p><p id="p0105">In conclusion, first, this phase 1/2 clinical trial of JR-141 established that JR-141 is not inferior to idursulfase in terms of its systemic effects. Second, it showed that four administrations of JR-141 at up to 2.0&#x000a0;mg/kg/week are safe. Third, and most notably, JR-141 significantly reduced CSF levels of GAGs, especially those of HS,&#x000a0;which is known to be a major neurotoxin in neuropathic MPS. Further studies will be carried out to establish the efficacy of JR-141 in treating the CNS symptoms caused by neuropathic MPS II.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Study Design</title><p id="p0110">We conducted a multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and exploratory efficacy of intravenously administered JR-141 (NCT 03128593).
