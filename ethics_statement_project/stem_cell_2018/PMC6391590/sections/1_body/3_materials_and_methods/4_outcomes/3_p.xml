<p id="p0150">Evaluations of exploratory efficacy focused on drug delivery to the CNS as measured by reductions in the substrate concentrations in the CSF. CSF was obtained by lumbar puncture before the initial dosing and after the last dosing in part 2 of the study. HS and DS were quantified as described previously.

 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> To evaluate systemic efficacy with regard to the somatic symptoms, HS and DS levels in the serum and urine were also measured. In addition, patients underwent computed tomography to assess hepatosplenomegaly. Cardiac structures and functions were evaluated by echocardiography.
