<p id="p0120">A total of 14 male patients were enrolled in the study. Two patients (aged 33 and 63) who had no intellectual disability and were able to recognize and verbally report their subjective symptoms were selected for the dose-escalation study (part 1) and were given 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg/week of JR-141 intravenously. In part 2 of the study, the other 12 patients (average age, 12.9 years; range, 6 to 25 years; SD, 5.3), seven of whom had intellectual disability, were randomly assigned to a 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg/week of JR-141 dosing group. Key inclusion criteria were as follows: age 6 years or older (16 years or older in the initial dose-escalation study) at the time of informed consent; a diagnosis of MPS II based on the measurement of overall IDS activity in leukocytes, plasma, and cultured skin fibroblasts along with a genetic analysis; under pharmacotherapy with idursulfase (0.5 mg/kg/week) for at least 12 weeks before the initial administration of JR-141. Key exclusion criteria included a history of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, practical inability to undergo lumbar puncture, serious drug allergy or hypersensitivity making them unsuitable for participation in the study, a history of receiving other investigational products within 4 months before the beginning of this study. All patients or legally acceptable representatives provided signed informed consent prior to enrolment. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in the appendix, and the study protocol is available online.</p>
