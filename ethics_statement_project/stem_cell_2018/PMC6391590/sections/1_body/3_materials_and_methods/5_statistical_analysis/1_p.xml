<p id="p0155">A non-compartment model analysis was used to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters for each subject at the time of blood collection. To analyze the pharmacokinetic endpoints, plasma drug concentrations adjusted for the plasma IDS concentration at baseline were used. Drug concentration in some subjects was 0 at 21Â hr after the final administration (one of the three time points when concentration measurements were used to calculate the elimination rate constant [k
 <sub>el</sub>]), making it impossible to calculate not only k
 <sub>el</sub>, but also elimination half-life (t
 <sub>1/2</sub>).
