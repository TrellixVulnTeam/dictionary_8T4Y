<p id="p0025">A BBB-penetrating fusion protein designated JR-141, which consists of intact human IDS and anti-human transferrin receptor (hTfR) antibody, has been developed by JCR Pharmaceuticals.

 </xref> Transferrin is one of the proteins that crosses the BBB through a mechanism of receptor-mediated transcytosis, which is utilized in the delivery of JR-141 to the brain. JR-141 has been shown to be distributed in the brain parenchyma of hTfR knockin mice and monkeys after intravenous administration.

 </xref> Notably, intravenous administration of human IDS fused with anti-mouse TfR antibody has reduced GAG accumulations in both the peripheral tissues and the brains of MPSÂ II model mice, leading to significant improvements of neurocognitive deficits.

In this report, we present the results of a multicenter, open-label, randomized phase 1/2 clinical trial of JR-141 to evaluate its pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy in patients with MPS II.
