 </xref> Since IDS is an essential enzyme for the catabolism of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) such as heparan sulfate (HS) and dermatan sulfate (DS), mutations in the IDS gene lead to pathological accumulation of GAGs in the lysosomes in most cells throughout the body, resulting in a broad spectrum of symptoms, including coarse facies, visceromegaly (hepatosplenomegaly), umbilical hernia, joint stiffness, upper airway obstruction, and cardiac dysfunctions.
