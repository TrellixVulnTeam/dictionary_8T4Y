<p id="p0100">This study has several limitations. First, because MPS II is a rare disease, the number of patients available to participate was extremely limited, leading to an inevitable lack of statistical power. In addition, the marked heterogeneity of the sample population further limits the generalizability of the study results. Second, no neurocognitive or neurodevelopmental assessments were made, because we considered the limited treatment period of 4Â weeks too short for any such assessments to be worthwhile. However, the aforementioned clinical observations of brief neurocognitive and motor changes even in the short period during which JR-141 was administered suggest that the drug may show salient efficacy in treating CNS disorders when administered on a long-term basis. Late-phase clinical trials are planned to investigate this. Third, the CSF levels of JR-141 were below the detection limit for pharmacokinetic measurement. This may have been because the timing of CSF sampling was too late to detect the drug before it was eliminated or because JR-141 was so swiftly and efficiently transported into the neurons after penetrating the BBB that too little was left in the CSF to measure. Nevertheless, the significant reductions in HS levels in the CSF of all patients following JR-141 administration are, we believe, robust evidence of the successful delivery of the drug to the CNS.</p>
