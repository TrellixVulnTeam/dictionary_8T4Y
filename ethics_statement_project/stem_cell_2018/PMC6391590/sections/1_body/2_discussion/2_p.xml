 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> all of which are associated with HS accumulation in the CNS, but not in patients with the forms of MPS that do not involve HS accumulation (MPS IV and VI). Impaired metabolism of HS leads to secondary accumulation of gangliosides that results in various CNS defects via multiple mechanisms, including tau protein hyperphosphorylation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and increased autophagy.

In other words, HS levels in CSF are not only an informative clinical surrogate endpoint in the evaluation of efficacy of therapeutics for neurodegeneration but may also be helpful for clinical understanding of neurocognitive deficits if they correspond well to the intracellular and lysosomal HS levels, both critical for neurotoxicity.
