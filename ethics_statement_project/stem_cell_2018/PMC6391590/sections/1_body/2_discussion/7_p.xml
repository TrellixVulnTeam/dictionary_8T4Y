<p id="p0105">In conclusion, first, this phase 1/2 clinical trial of JR-141 established that JR-141 is not inferior to idursulfase in terms of its systemic effects. Second, it showed that four administrations of JR-141 at up to 2.0 mg/kg/week are safe. Third, and most notably, JR-141 significantly reduced CSF levels of GAGs, especially those of HS, which is known to be a major neurotoxin in neuropathic MPS. Further studies will be carried out to establish the efficacy of JR-141 in treating the CNS symptoms caused by neuropathic MPS II.</p>
