<p id="p0075">This study demonstrated the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of a novel compound JR-141 for patients with neuropathic MPS II. It also suggested, despite the short treatment period of 4Â weeks, that JR-141 seems to be no less effective than conventional enzyme replacement therapy with idursulfase in reducing GAG concentrations in the plasma and urine, which needs to be established through a longer treatment period. Importantly, JR-141 markedly decreased HS levels in the CSF of our patients with MPS II, which remained elevated after they had been treated with idursulfase prior to this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of significant drug delivery across the BBB to address neurodegeneration in patients with MPS II.</p>
