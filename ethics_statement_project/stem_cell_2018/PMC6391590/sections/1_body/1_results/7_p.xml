<p id="p0060">To evaluate the effects of JR-141 on neurodegeneration in MPS II, we measured the concentrations of HS and DS in CSF as biomarkers of neurodegeneration in all subjects before we initiated JR-141 administration (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). We found that the concentrations of HS were much higher than those of DS, which is consistent with the data from an MPS II study using mouse models.

 </xref> Nevertheless, both HS and DS concentrations in CSF were higher in all MPS II patients than in the nine non-MPS II subjects, indicating that the effect of idursulfase alone on the substrate accumulation in the CNS is negligible. The HS concentrations in the CSF of the patients with intellectual disability (5,895 ± 1,260 ng/mL; range, 4,220–7,900 ng/mL; n = 6) were, in alignment with a previous report,

 </xref> higher than in those without (3,632 ± 809 ng/mL; range, 2,560–4,580 ng/mL; n = 5; 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), based on the reference CSF-HS value from the non-MPS II patients (363 ± 217 ng/mL). Notably, weekly intravenous administrations of JR-141 for 3 weeks reduced HS concentrations in the CSF of all patients. The values of HS in CSF before JR-141 administration were 4,615 ± 1,559 ng/mL (n = 6, mean ± SD) in the low-dose group (1.0 mg/kg/week), and 5,168 ± 1,698 ng/mL (n = 5, mean ± SD) in the high-dose group (2.0 mg/kg/week). After the final dosing of JR-141, the values had fallen to 3,387 ± 1,046 ng/mL (1.0 mg/kg/week) and 3,397 ± 1,057 ng/ml (2.0 mg/kg/week; 25.1% ± 12.9% and 31.5% ± 3.9% decrement from the initial values, respectively). The DS concentrations in CSF were also decreased significantly by 2.0 mg/kg/week of JR-141. These results suggest that intravenously administered JR-141 crosses the BBB and delivers IDS to the brain parenchyma, thereby inhibiting the pathological accumulation of GAGs.
