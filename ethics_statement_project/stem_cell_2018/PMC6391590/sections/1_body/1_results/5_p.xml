 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> summarizes the adverse drug reactions observed during the study period. In part 2, one patient felt throat irritation and developed a transient rash during the first administration of JR-141 (1.0 mg/kg). Two patients experienced transient urticaria, one after the second administration and the other after the fourth (2.0 mg/kg). Mild to moderate pyrexia was also observed in the same two patients, but it abated quickly. One patient showed transient hypohaptoglobinemia after the final administration (1.0 mg/kg). More than 4 weeks after the completion of the study, one patient with a comorbid diagnosis of epilepsy became delirious after being prescribed a new antiepileptic; this patient was admitted to hospital for observation, hence the episode classified as a serious adverse event. Although the delirium abated after discontinuation of the new antiepileptic, we did not feel able to conclude that this episode was completely unrelated to the administration of JR-141. Overall, however, these results indicate that four administrations of JR-141 at a dosage of as high as 2.0 mg/kg/week are safe and well tolerated.
