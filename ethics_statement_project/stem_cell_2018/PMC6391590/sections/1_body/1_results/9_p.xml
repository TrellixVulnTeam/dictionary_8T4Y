<p id="p0070">Before the administration of JR-141, seven patients tested positive for anti-IDS antibody, while five tested positive for anti-JR-141 antibody. Four patients were positive for both anti-IDS and anti-JR-141 antibodies. No marked increase in the titers of these antibodies was observed in any of the patients after four administrations of JR-141, regardless of dosage. In addition, no patients who were negative for either antibody at the initiation of the study developed
