 <p>Okuyama etÂ al. report on a first-in-human study of iduronate-2-sulfatase fused with anti-human transferrin receptor antibody (JR-141) in 14 patients with mucopolysaccharidosis II to evaluate its pharmacokinetics, safety, and potential efficacy. The results show successful penetration of the compound across the blood-brain barrier, suggestive of its effect for neurodegeneration.</p>
