<p id="Par21">The primary outcome of this study is AMH level. Serum samples were centrifuged, stored at − 20 °C and shipped on dry ice to the VUmc Amsterdam where all AMH levels were analysed in the same laboratory using an ultra-sensitive Elecsys AMH assay (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) at one time point. Data on AMH levels were sent to the central data center in Mainz and merged into the central database and subsequently pseudonymized to the investigators. In addition to the continuous AMH levels, patients will be divided in two groups based on AMH levels considered relevant as a proxy for gonadal impairment, considering data on AMH levels in healthy females measured with the same assay in the reference laboratory in the VUmc Amsterdam. These details will be described in detail in the forthcoming manuscript. In addition, detailed information about menstrual history, and/or FSH level, and/or information on usage of artificial reproductive techniques will be used to evaluate gonadal impairment.</p>
