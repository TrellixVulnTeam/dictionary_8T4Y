<p id="Par18">PanCareLIFE consists of 8 work packages of which 5 focus on scientific work. Work package 4 encompasses two parts: WP4a focuses on genetic variation in gonadal impairment, and WP4b focuses on genetic variation in ototoxicity. This study addresses work package 4a. For this work package, adult female CCS were recruited in ten institutions from seven countries (Fig.
