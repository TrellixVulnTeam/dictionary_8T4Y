<p id="Par22">Blood or saliva samples were obtained for DNA isolation. Blood samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 781) were stored at ≤ − 20 °C and shipped on dry ice while saliva kits (
 <italic>n</italic> = 56) were stored and shipped at room temperature. Genomic DNA was extracted by the salting-out method. The choice of genotyping array was made after extensive comparison between all currently available arrays. The Infinium® Global Screening Array was chosen based on the rich up-to-date content and its suitability for GWAS including rare variants, while also containing clinically relevant content, including pharmacogenetics.
