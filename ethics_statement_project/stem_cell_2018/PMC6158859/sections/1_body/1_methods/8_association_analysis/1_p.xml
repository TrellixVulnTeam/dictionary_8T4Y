<p id="Par26">For the candidate gene approach we will extract the genotypes of a list of predetermined SNPs based on published literature. The Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis test will be employed to compare the distribution between groups with continuous data. Logistic regression will be performed to calculate the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval of the SNPs to assess their risk of gonadal impairment. This model will adjust for several confounders: principal component analysis (PCA) will be used to correct for population stratification by modelling ancestry differences between cases and controls [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Furthermore, the model will adjust for cyclophosphamide equivalent dose (CED). This measure enables comparison of alkylating agent exposure independent of drug dose distribution within a particular cohort (as the formerly used alkylating agent dose), permitting comparison across different cohorts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In addition, linear regression will be performed to calculate the effect of the SNPs on continuous AMH levels. This model will include age, in addition to the principal components and CED. The modifying effect of genetic predisposition on the association between CED and gonadal impairment will be also explored.
