<p id="Par17">For the current study we included female adult survivors (≥ 18 years) of childhood cancer, diagnosed before the age of 25 years, with a follow-up time of at least 5 years after diagnosis. Eligible survivors had to have been treated with chemotherapy. Exclusion criteria included radiotherapy involving both ovaries, defined as bilateral irradiation of the abdomen below the pelvic crest, or radiotherapy involving the pituitary, defined as cranial or craniospinal irradiation. Furthermore, survivors were not eligible if they had undergone myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation, with or without total body irradiation.</p>
