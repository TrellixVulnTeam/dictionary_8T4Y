<p id="Par30">Sufficiently-sized cohorts are of key importance in genetic association studies in order to have adequate power to identify low-risk variants. This is especially of importance in the evaluation of common traits such as gonadal function, where many common variants may operate with small effect sizes. To this end, we performed a power calculation to estimate the required cohort size for the current study, based on the estimated allelic frequency in our population.</p>
