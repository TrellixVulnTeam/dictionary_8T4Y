<p id="Par33">In conclusion, we describe the design of a genetic association study that will evaluate the association of genetic variability with gonadal impairment in a European cohort of childhood cancer survivors, with AMH levels as the primary outcome measure. This international collaboration will enhance knowledge of genetic variation which may be included in risk prediction models for gonadal impairment in CCS. In the future, patients with childhood cancer, parents and survivors may benefit from better individualized counselling concerning future fertility options and necessity for fertility preservation.</p>
