<p id="Par13">As a result of continuous improvements in treatment and supportive care, survival rates after childhood cancer have increased over the past decades, now reaching 80% in developed countries. However, the harsh treatment components that have led to increased survival rates can induce serious long-term complications. One in every four childhood cancer survivors (CCS) reveals severe or life-threatening adverse late effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and three in every four survivors report at least one late effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In female CCS, apart from radiotherapy involving the field of the ovaries or pituitary, alkylating agents are important risk factors for fertility impairment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and damage is dose-dependent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Such toxic agents can damage the ovarian follicle pool severely, leading to impaired fertility illustrated by an absent or substantially shortened reproductive window. Consequently, considering the current tendency in European countries to postpone childbearing, female survivors may find themselves involuntarily childless, leading to an increased use of artificial reproductive techniques. The feasibility to reach parenthood is of great significance to both parents of children with cancer and to CCS, and is an important determinant of quality of life [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In addition, gonadal impairment or early menopause carries adverse health risks for women, such as an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis, which require intensive and long-term medical attention [
