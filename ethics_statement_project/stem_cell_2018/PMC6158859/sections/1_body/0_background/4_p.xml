<p id="Par16">The current study is part of this European wide endeavor and focuses on the identification of genetic factors which play a role in the risk of treatment-induced gonadal impairment among female childhood cancer survivors. Its specific objectives are to validate previously identified genetic polymorphisms associated with gonadal impairment in female childhood cancer survivors, using a candidate gene approach; and to identify 
 <italic>novel</italic> SNPs that are independently associated with chemotherapy induced gonadal impairment in female childhood cancer survivors, using a GWAS.
