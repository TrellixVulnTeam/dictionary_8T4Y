  </caption>
  <p>The results of this pilot clinical study demonstrate that cell therapy may improve right ventricular function in patients with nonischemic heart failure. Because the improvements in right ventricular function correlated with increased viability of interventricular septum, ventricular interdependence may represent a potential underlying mechanism for these findings.</p>
