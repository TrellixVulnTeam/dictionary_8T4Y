Patients enrolled in the present sub‐study include patients enrolled in the repetitive arm of the parent study, who received transendocardial cell therapy at baseline and again 6 months after enrollment. This design allowed for the analysis of the repetitive electroanatomical mapping, which was performed before cell injections at both time points. The study was conducted at the Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation Centre at University Medical Centre Ljubljana between January 2014 and September 2016.
