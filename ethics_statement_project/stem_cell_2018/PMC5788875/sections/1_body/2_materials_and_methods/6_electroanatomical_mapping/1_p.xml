<p>Electroanatomical mapping was performed using the Biosense NOGA system (Biosense‐Webster, Diamond Bar, California,

In short, electroanatomical mapping allows for point‐by‐point analysis of left ventricular viability and local contractility. Using this technique, maps of color‐coded myocardial viability (unipolar voltage; UV) and regional myocardial contraction (linear shortening) and their corresponding bull's‐eye maps, consisting of ≥150 sampling points, were generated for each patient prior to stem cell transplantation. Unipolar voltage was averaged for each of the 9 myocardial segments. Viability of the interventricular septum (IVS) was defined by averaging the measurements obtained in the septal and basal septal areas. In accordance with previous data on electroanatomical mapping in nonischemic DCM
