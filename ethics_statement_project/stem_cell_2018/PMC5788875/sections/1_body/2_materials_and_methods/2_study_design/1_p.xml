<p>Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to transendocardial cell therapy (SC Group) or no cell therapy (Controls). The allocation was done according to the covariate adaptive randomization strategy. At baseline, patients in the SC Group received granulocyte‐colony stimulating factor (G‐CSF); CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells were collected by apheresis and injected transendocardially in the target areas defined by electroanatomical mapping. In the Controls, no mobilization, apheresis, or cell therapy was performed. All patients were followed for 6 months, and in the SC Group electroanatomical mapping was repeated at the end of the follow‐up. At the time of enrollment and at 6 months thereafter, we performed echocardiography and 6‐minute walk test and measured plasma levels of N‐terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP).
