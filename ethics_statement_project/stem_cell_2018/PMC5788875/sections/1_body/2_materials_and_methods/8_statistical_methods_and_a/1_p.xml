 <xref rid="sct312271-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, the sample size calculation for this study was based on the 90% probability that the study will detect a treatment difference with a 5% 2‐sided significance level, if the true difference in TAPSE at 6 months between the SC Group and Controls is 0.40 cm (assuming a standard deviation of 0.45 cm). Continuous variables are presented as means (±standard deviation). Categorical variables were compared with the use of the chi‐square test. Differences between the SC Group and Controls were analyzed by two‐way analysis of variance. The relationship of changes in TAPSE and changes in IVS viability was evaluated by Pearson's correlation coefficient. Statistical significance was assumed for 
 <italic>p</italic> values of less than .05. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software (version 20.0, IBM, Armonk, NY,
