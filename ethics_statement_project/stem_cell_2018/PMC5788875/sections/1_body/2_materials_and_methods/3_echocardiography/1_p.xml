<p>Echocardiography was performed according to European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging recommendations 
 <xref rid="sct312271-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>. All images were stored and analyzed at the end of the follow‐up by an independent echocardiographer who was blinded for the group allocation and timing of the recordings. RV size was obtained from two‐dimensional apical four‐chamber view. RV function was assessed by tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), peak systolic tissue Doppler velocity of tricuspid annulus (St), and percent of fractional area change (FAC). Improved RV function was defined as concomitant improvement in TAPSE, St, and FAC. Tissue Doppler velocity mitral annular early diastolic velocity (e′) was measured on medial mitral ring, and the ratio between early mitral inflow velocity and mitral annular early diastolic velocity (E/e′) was calculated for estimation of the left ventricular filling pressure.
