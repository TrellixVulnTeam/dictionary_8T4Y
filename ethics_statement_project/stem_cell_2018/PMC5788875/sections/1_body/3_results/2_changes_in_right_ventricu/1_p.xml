<p>At baseline, the two groups did not differ in parameters of right ventricular function. At 6 months, we found a significant improvement in TAPSE, St, and FAC in SC Group but not in Controls, which resulted in significantly higher values of all 3 parameters of RV function in the SC Group when compared with Controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="sct312271-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In the SC Group, we also found a significant increase in LVEF and 6‐minute walk test, as well as a decrease in NT‐proBNP; however, no significant changes were present in the Control Group. E/e′, left ventricular end‐diastolic dimension, and RV size did not change in any of the groups (Table
