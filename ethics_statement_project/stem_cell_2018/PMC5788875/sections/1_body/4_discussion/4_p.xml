<p>However, in the present study, we found an improvement in RV function also in patients who showed no improvement in IVS viability, suggesting that mechanisms other than ventricular interdependence may be of importance. There is increasing evidence that decreased myocardial perfusion also may play an important role in heart failure patients without epicardial coronary artery disease. In patients with DCM, coronary flow reserve is often impaired both globally and regionally because of impaired vasculogenesis and angiogenesis

Interestingly, although the majority of changes occurred in the myocardial segments targeted with stem cell injections, some improvement in perfusion occurred also in the remote nontargeted areas, suggesting that a paracrine component may play an important role. Similarly, in accordance with this hypothesis, the improvement in RV function in patients without IVS improvement may reflect the remote paracrine effect of CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell therapy.
