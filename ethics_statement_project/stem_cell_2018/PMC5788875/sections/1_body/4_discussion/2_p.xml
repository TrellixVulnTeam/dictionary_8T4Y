<p>In several preclinical settings it has been demonstrated that RV function may be improved by the use of cell therapies. In a murine model of RV failure, intramyocardial injection of mononuclear cells was associated with a reduction of RV fibrosis, an increase in the expression of proangiogenetic markers, and a significant improvement in RV function

In isolated rat hearts, pretreatment with mesenchymal stem cells was also associated with decreased ischemia‐reperfusion injury and better functional recovery of the RV after acute pressure overload
