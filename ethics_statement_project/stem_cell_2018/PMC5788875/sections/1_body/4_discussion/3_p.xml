<p>Data of the present study suggest that the effects of CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell therapy are not limited to the left ventricle but may also be associated with improved RV function in DCM: we found a significant improvement in all parameters of RV function at 6 months after cell therapy in more than half of patients. Interestingly, there was a strong correlation between parameters of RV function and viability of IVS, suggesting that ventricular interdependence may at least partially account for the observed changes

Previously it has been demonstrated that measurement of endocardial UV can be used to identify left ventricular dysfunction in the absence of macroscopic scar defined with standard cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) criteria, which suggests that unipolar electrograms could also detect a more diffuse underlying myocardial process

Moreover, an inverse relation between amplitude of unipolar endocardial recordings and myocardial fibrosis burden has been described already in an experimental model of nonischemic cardiomyopathy and in an anatomic study of explanted human hearts

Thus, it appears that in the absence of macroscopic fibrosis, diffuse microscopic fibrosis may explain the impairment of left ventricular function in the setting of DCM. This suggests that the improvement of viability in the IVS at 6 months after cell therapy may potentially reflect the changes of diffuse microscopic fibrosis.
