<p>The results of our study are subject to several limitations. The findings of the present study represent an extension of the parent study, with the primary aim to compare the effects of repetitive and single‐dose cell therapy on left ventricular function in patients with nonischemic DCM. The control arm did not receive any placebo procedures. Although, to minimize the bias, echocardiography data were analyzed at the end of the follow‐up period by an independent echosonographer, this does not fully overcome the limitations of an unblinded study. However, the echocardiography data were corroborated by the analysis of electroanatomical mapping, which is a fully automated procedure that generates data on myocardial viability using a computer algorithm performing in an operator‐independent manner. Although our sample size was small, both groups of patients were well matched at baseline. Our patient population included patients with DCM, but no biopsies were performed to exclude secondary cardiomyopathies. Finally, we recognize that patients with DCM are a heterogeneous patient population and dynamic changes in IVS viability and RV function may be multifactorial. In particular, parameters of RV function also may be affected by changes in loading conditions; however, we have found no changes in LV filling pressures or RV size in our study cohort.</p>
