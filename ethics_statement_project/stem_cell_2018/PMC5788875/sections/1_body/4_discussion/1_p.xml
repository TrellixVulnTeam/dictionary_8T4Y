<p>This is the first clinical trial to date investigating the effects of cell therapy on RV function in DCM. In these patients, we found a significant improvement in parameters of RV function with transendocardial transplantation of cells in the left ventricle. Because the improvements in RV function correlated with increased viability of IVS, ventricular interdependence may represent a potential underlying mechanism for these findings.</p>
