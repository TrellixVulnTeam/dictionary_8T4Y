  <p>Changes of right ventricular function during the 6‐month follow‐up. We found a significant improvement in TAPSE, St, and FAC in the SC Group (red lines) but not in the Control Group (blue lines). This resulted in significantly higher values of all three parameters of RV function in the SC Group when compared with Controls. Abbreviations: FAC, percent of fractional area change; St, peak systolic tissue Doppler velocity of tricuspid annulus; TAPSE, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion.</p>
