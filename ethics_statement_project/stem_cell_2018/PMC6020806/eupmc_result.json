adolescents with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). At study entry, B-ALL patients were classified as standard risk (SR) or high risk (HR) based on age, white blood cell (WBC) count, and central nervous system status. After achieving complete remission (CR), patients with high end-induction minimal residual disease (MRD) (\u226510-3 by polymerase chain reaction analysis of patient-specific antigen receptor rearrangements) and/or adverse cytogenetics (KMT2A rearrangement or hypodiploidy) were reclassified as very high risk (VHR) and received intensified therapy. IKZF1 deletion status was retrospectively evaluated by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Between 2005 and 2011, 678 Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-ALL patients aged 1 to 18 years enrolled; 651 achieved CR and 648 received a final risk group. Among all 678 patients, 5-year event-free survival (EFS) was 87% (95% confidence interval [CI], 84-89) and overall survival 93% (95% CI, 90-94). Five-year disease-free survival of SR patients (N = 407) was 94% (95% CI, 91-96), HR (N = 176) was 84% (95% CI, 77-88), and VHR (N = 65) was 79% (95% CI, 67-87). IKZF1 deletion was present in 62 of 385 (16%) assessed patients and was associated with inferior 5-year EFS (63%; 95% CI, 49%-74% vs 88%; 95% CI, 84%-91%; P < .001), and higher 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse, including among those with low MRD (24% vs 8%, P = .001). In multivariable analysis, age \u226515 years, WBC \u226550\u2009\u00d7 109/L, IKZF1 deletion, and MRD \u226510-4 was each associated with inferior outcome. In conclusion, risk-stratified therapy on DFCI 05-001 resulted in favorable outcomes for B-ALL patients, including those with VHR features.
