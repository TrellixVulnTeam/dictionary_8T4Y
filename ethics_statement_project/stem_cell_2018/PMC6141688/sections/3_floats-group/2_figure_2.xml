  <p>Systemic G-CSF treatment impairs chemotaxis in neutrophils from healthy donors. Purified neutrophils from peripheral blood of healthy, untreated donors (
   <italic>n</italic> = 8) were incubated with 0, 10, or 50 ng/ml human recombinant G-CSF. Thereafter, a chemotaxis assay was performed using fMLP as chemoattractant and half migration time 
   <bold>(A)</bold> as well as velocity at half migration time 
   <bold>(B)</bold> was determined. Neutrophils pre-treated with 0, 10, and 50 ng/ml of G-CSF respectively were stained with a PE-labeled anti-fMLP receptor antibody. The histogram is showing a representative experiment of three similar replications 
   <bold>(C)</bold>. Statistical analysis was performed with a Kruskal-Wallis test for 
   <bold>(A)</bold> (
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.0098) and 
   <bold>(B)</bold> (
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.0093), complemented with Mann-Whitney U-tests showing that samples 0 and 50 ng/ml are significantly different for 
   <bold>(A,B)</bold> with 
   <sup>*</sup>
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05.
