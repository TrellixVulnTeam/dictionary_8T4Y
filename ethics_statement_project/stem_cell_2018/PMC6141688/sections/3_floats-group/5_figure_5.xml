  <p>ROS production and phagocytosis are not affected by G-CSF in stem cell donors and neither in allogeneic transplant recipients. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Production of ROS by neutrophils was measured as area under the curve (AUC) in the stem cell donor group before and after G-CSF-treatment (
   <italic>n</italic> = 10). Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired students 
   <italic>t</italic>-test. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Production of ROS measured as AUC in the samples from patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation using the samples from the stem cell donors before G-CSF-treatment as a control. Statistical analysis was performed using a Kruskal-Wallis test due to skewness of data. 
   <bold>(C,D)</bold> Phagocytosis measured as the uptake of pH-sensitive pHrodo beads that triggered phagocytosis by neutrophil isolated from 
   <bold>(C)</bold> stem cell donor group before and after G-CSF-treatment (
   <italic>n</italic> = 10) and from 
   <bold>(D)</bold> patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation using the samples from the stem cell donors before G-CSF-treatment as a control. Phagocytosis rate was calculated as percent out of 100 percent control. Statistical analysis was performed using a One-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison tests. Statistical analyses in 
   <bold>(A-D)</bold> did not reveal significance
