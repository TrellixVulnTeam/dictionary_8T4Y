  <p>Plasma from G-CSF-treated individuals contains lower amount of IL-8 than untreated controls. G-CSF 
   <bold>(A)</bold>, IL-8 
   <bold>(B)</bold>, and CRP 
   <bold>(D)</bold> concentrations in plasma obtained from stem cell donors (
   <italic>n</italic> = 10) before and after G-CSF-treatment. Each value was determined from a mean of four technical replicates for G-CSF and IL-8. For IL-8 
   <bold>(B)</bold> all the samples after G-CSF treatment were below the range of the assay (0.72 pg/ml). To be able to perform statistical analysis the values were extrapolated to 0.72 pg/ml. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Levels of IL-8 secreted by neutrophils 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> after G-CSF (50 ng/ml) or mock treatment for 30 min and subsequently either stimulated with LPS (1 Î¼g/ml, labeled as LPS +) or left untreated (labeled as LPS -). The levels of IL-8 were measured by ELISA after 6 h stimulation. The CRP values 
   <bold>(D)</bold> were measured as single measurements for each donor before and after G-CSF treatment. Statistical analysis was performed using a paired students 
   <italic>t</italic>-test 
   <bold>(C)</bold> and Mann-Whitney U-test 
   <bold>(A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>,
   <bold>D)</bold> when data was not normally distributed.
