  <p>G-CSF treatment affects neutrophil migration. Stem cell donors before and after treatment were analyzed for neutrophil function. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Neutrophil count measured before and after G-CSF-treatment in the stem cell donor group (
   <italic>n</italic> = 10). Revealed a significant increase in the number of circulating neutrophils after G-CSF treatment. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Distribution of half migration time during chemotaxis within the stem cell donor group before and after G-CSF-treatment. Half migration time was defined as the time required for half-maximal fluorescence signal indicative for migration toward 10 nM fMLP. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> The distribution of velocity during chemotaxis before and after G-CSF-treatment is indicated. Velocity was measured as Δ %/min at half migration time indicating the speed of the neutrophils when they have reached half maximal fluorescence in the bottom well. Blood cell differentiation analysis 
   <bold>(D)</bold> before and 
   <bold>(E)</bold> after purification of neutrophils from stem cell donors before (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3) and after (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4) GCSF treatment confirmed that the purification enriched mature neutrophils &gt;95% independent of previous G-CSF treatment. Statistical analysis was performed using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test 
   <bold>(A–C)</bold>.
