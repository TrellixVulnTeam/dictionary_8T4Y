<p>Peripheral venous blood was collected in EDTA-containing tubes and neutrophils were isolated using a Histopaque-1119 separation followed by a Percoll gradient, as previously described (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Viable cells were counted in a Neubauer chamber using trypan blue staining and subsequently diluted according to assay protocols. As demonstrated earlier, this procedure leads to a neutrophils purity of &gt; 93% (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). To assess neutrophil maturity, full blood as well as isolated neutrophil fractions were analyzed for their exact cell composition. We prepared blood smears on glass slides as well as smears from neutrophil isolations, which were resuspended in plasma from the same sample. These smears were fixed and Giemsa stained. Trained personnel used these smears to perform a comprehensive blood differentiation analysis at the Unit of Laboratory Medicine at the Norrland University Hospital in Ume√• (project number FFLA01). All samples were analyzed in a blinded fashion. Band cells were considered immature, cells containing a segmented nucleus were considered mature (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).
