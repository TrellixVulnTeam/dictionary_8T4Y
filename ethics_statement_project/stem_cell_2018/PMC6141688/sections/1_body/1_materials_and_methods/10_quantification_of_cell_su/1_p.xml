<p>G-CSF treated as well as untreated neutrophils were stained with labeled monoclonal anti-fMLP receptor antibody coupled to PE (PE, MACS, Miltenyi Biotec) in PBS supplemented with 3% FCS in a final dilution of 1:10 and incubated for 30 min at 8Â°C. Cells were washed 3 times in PBS with 3% FCS followed by flow cytometry analysis (BD Biosciences LSR II). The population of neutrophils were identified using FSC-A and SSC-A. At least 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells were analyzed per sample and all samples were run in duplicates.
