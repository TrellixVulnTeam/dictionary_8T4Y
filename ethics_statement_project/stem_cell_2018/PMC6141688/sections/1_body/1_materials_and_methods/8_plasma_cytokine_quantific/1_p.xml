<p>Along with neutrophil isolation from HSC donors, 1.5 ml of plasma were collected and immediately stored at−80°C. These samples were used to analyze levels of human G-CSF and interleukin 8 (IL-8) using Luminex ELISA assays (Bio-Rad, Bio-Tech, respectively). Assays were performed according to manufacturer's protocol using a magnetic beads washer. For G-CSF quantification, the samples (Luminex, Bio-Rad) were diluted 1:4 in sample diluent. For IL-8 quantification in plasma from HSC donors, a high-sensitive Luminex assay (BioTech) was used with standard range 0.78–3200 pg/ml. Samples were diluted 1:2 in calibrator diluent RD6-40 and added to plates for subsequent analysis with a Bio-Plex reader (Bio-Plex 200 system, Bio-Rad). Plasma samples were used for the analysis of C-reactive protein (CRP) which was quantified using the CRPL3 cobas® assay (Roche Diagnostics Scandinavia) performed by the Clinical Chemistry Laboratory at Umeå University Hospital according to the manufacturer's recommendations and the standard ISO/IEC 17025:2005 with continuous evaluations by the Swedish Board for Accreditation and Conformity Assessment.</p>
