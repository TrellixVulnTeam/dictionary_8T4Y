<p>To analyze IL-8 release upon G-CSF stimulation, neutrophils were isolated from healthy volunteers, and 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> neutrophils were treated with 50 ng/ml G-CSF. After 30 min, 1 μg/ml LPS was added as a co-stimulant for 6 h. As control, cells were treated with medium only. After 6 h, supernatants were collected and directly frozen at −80°C. The IL-8 concentration was quantified according to manufacturer's protocol (BioLegend Human IL-8 ELISA Max standard set).
