<p>The second cohort consisted of patients undergoing allogeneic HSC transplantation (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Blood samples were taken from the patients 2 weeks after successful neutrophil engraftment which was defined by absolute neutrophil count of &gt;1.0 Ã— 10
 <sup>9</sup>/l (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1B</xref>). Depending on the individual patient, one additional sample was taken either 4 or 8 weeks post engraftment (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1B</xref>). When comparing the two groups (HSC donors vs allogeneic transplant recipients) there was no statistical significant difference between the groups according to age (mean 47.0 y vs. 49.6 y, respectively) (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). To control for maturity of circulating neutrophils, blood of 4 additional HSC donors (not included before in table 1) was collected
