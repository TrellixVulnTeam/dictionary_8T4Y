<p>Phagocytosis was assessed using pH rodo beads (pHrodoTM Red 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> bioparticles conjugated for phagocytosis, Lifetechnologies) that change their FI pH-dependently. Briefly, 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> neutrophils per well were added into a black 96-well plate with 100 μg beads/well. Beads put directly into a buffer with pH 4 served as 100% FI control. Beads in medium with pH 7.4 served as blank. Neutrophils pre-treated with 10 μM cytochalasin D for 15 min to block phagocytosis served as negative control. FI (540/580 nm) was measured every 60 min for 3 h (FLUOstar Omega plate reader, BMG Labtech).
