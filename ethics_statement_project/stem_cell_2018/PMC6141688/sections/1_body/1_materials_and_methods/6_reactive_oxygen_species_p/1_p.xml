<p>Oxidative burst was quantified by luminol-based chemiluminescence (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Briefly, 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> neutrophils per well were seeded in white 96-well plates with 50 μM luminol and 1.2 U/ml horseradish peroxidase (both Sigma-Aldrich). Neutrophils were stimulated with 100 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or left untreated. Chemiluminescence as a measure of hydrogen peroxide production was detected every 2 min for 3 h in an Infinite 200 luminometer (Tecan). ROS were quantified by the area under the curve (AUC) calculated for the time given (3 h) and reduced by background of unstimulated cells.
