<p>We compared neutrophil chemotaxis from controls and allogeneic transplant recipients 2 weeks after neutrophil engraftment (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>) and observed significant differences. Half migration time is increased (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) and velocity at half migration time is decreased for the group of allogeneic transplant recipients (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) similarly to the G-CSF-treated healthy HSC donors (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B,C</xref>). This indicates that the G-CSF-mediated effects on neutrophil chemotaxis remained in the recipient 2 weeks after neutrophil engraftment. Healthy HSC donors prior to G-CSF treatment serving as controls were homogenous for age, but not for gender when compared to the transplant recipients. However, evaluating our data in a gender-separated fashion we do not find differences between the sexes (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S4</xref>). This indicates that our findings do not correlate with differences in gender or age between the groups.
