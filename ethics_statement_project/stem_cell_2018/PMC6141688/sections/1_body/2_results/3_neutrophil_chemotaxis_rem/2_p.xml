<p>Analysis of neutrophils sampled 4 weeks after neutrophil engraftment and beyond (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>) showed that this effect was transient. Neutrophil chemotaxis was not significantly different from those of the untreated controls (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A,B</xref>). Thus, our data implies that there might be a window of increased risk of infection for the transplant recipients after engraftment (30 days in average) in which neutrophil numbers are high, but they might still have functional limitations (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
