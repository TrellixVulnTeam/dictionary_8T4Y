<p>We next investigated whether G-CSF had a similar effect on neutrophil chemotaxis if directly applied to neutrophils 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. For this purpose, isolated neutrophils from peripheral blood of eight healthy volunteers were pre-incubated with 10 and 50 ng/ml G-CSF 
 <italic>prior</italic> to the migration assay. Indeed, we observed that high concentrations of G-CSF decreased the chemotactic ability of isolated neutrophils (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,B</xref>). With 50 ng/ml G-CSF, chemotaxis was significantly impaired as determined by half migration time and velocity at half migration time. This demonstrates that G-CSF can directly decrease migration activity of isolated neutrophils 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> although to a smaller extent. To test whether this effect could result from a removal of the fMLF-specific G-protein coupled receptor, we quantified its surface expression by flow cytometry. We incubated purified neutrophils with 10 and 50 ng/ml G-CSF and quantified surface exposure of the receptor by staining with antibodies directed against fMLF receptor (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). We could not observe any differences between treated and untreated neutrophils suggesting that surface exposure of the fMLF receptor on neutrophils was not affected by G-CSF treatment.
