<p>We determined chemotaxis of neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood of G-CSF-treated HSC donors (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>). As expected, the total neutrophil count increased in the blood of these individuals ~ 9-fold upon treatment (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). When analyzing the neutrophils 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic>, we detected that neutrophils isolated from HSC donors after G-CSF-treatment displayed significantly increased half migration time and a reduced velocity at half migration time compared to neutrophils before treatment (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B,C</xref>). In contrast, spontaneous, unstimulated migration of neutrophils was similar using neutrophils from donors before and after G-CSF treatment (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref>) as determined by half migration time and velocity at half migration time (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref>). In summary, chemotaxis of neutrophils from HSC donors after G-CSF-treatment was reduced compared to neutrophils from the same individuals before treatment. This suggests that G-CSF administration in healthy HSC donors could reduce the ability of circulating neutrophils to migrate upon chemotactic stimulation. Of note, the number of immature neutrophils, so-called band cells, was negligibly small below 2% before and after G-CSF treatment in both, full blood and neutrophil isolation fractions (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D,E</xref>) as determined by a complete blood differentiation analysis. Further, the neutrophil isolation strategy chosen for this study proved to be efficient in enriching the neutrophil content to &gt; 95%.
