<p>Next, we investigated potential mechanisms for the reduced chemotaxis of G-CSF-treated neutrophils. Interleukin 8 (IL-8) is a central chemokine for neutrophil recruitment contributing to the extravasation of neutrophils to the site of infection (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase serum protein of hepatic origin, has been previously implicated to suppress neutrophil chemotaxis 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). We therefore, analyzed plasma samples from HSC donors, taken before and after G-CSF treatment, for IL-8 and CRP levels. To reveal possible correlations, we also quantified plasma levels of G-CSF. After treatment, G-CSF concentrations were significantly increased, 1042 pg/ml compared to 8 pg/ml before treatment (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Notably, we observed a significant decrease of IL-8 in plasma of G-CSF-treated individuals as compared to the samples taken before treatment (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). After treatment, IL-8 levels were at detection limit (0.72 pg/ml), whereas before treatment all obtained values for IL-8 were within detection range. Despite this observation in plasma, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> priming of neutrophils from healthy volunteers with 50 Î¼g/ml G-CSF did not affect the release of IL-8 upon stimulation with endotoxin lipopolysaccharide from 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). In contrast to IL-8, acute phase protein CRP levels in plasma significantly increased upon G-CSF treatment (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>).
