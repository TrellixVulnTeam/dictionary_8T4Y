<p>ROS, produced by the NADPH oxidase complex in phagocytes, are important mediators of cell signaling and very powerful effectors of antimicrobial killing. Thus, we investigated whether G-CSF treatment alters total ROS production in neutrophils stimulated with PMA for 3 h. We could not detect a difference in ROS production by neutrophils from HSC donors before and after G-CSF-treatment (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Similarly, neutrophils from allogeneic transplant recipients did not display a significantly altered ROS production when comparing sample 1 and sample 2 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). This implies that the neutrophil's potential to produce ROS was unaffected by G-CSF treatment.
