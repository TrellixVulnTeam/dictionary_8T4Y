<p>As professional phagocytes, engulfment of microbes is a key mode of action of neutrophils. We therefore quantified phagocytic uptake using fluorescently-labeled beads tagged with surface molecules from 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. Upon engulfment, these beads increase fluorescence intensity in the acidic milieu of the mature phagosome. To confirm actual phagocytosis, we included neutrophils treated with cytochalasin D as a negative control. Cytochalasin D inhibits cytoskeleton rearrangements and thus allows discrimination between adherence and phagocytosis. When comparing the phagocytic uptake by neutrophils from HSC donors before and after G-CSF treatment as well as the neutrophils from the allogeneic transplant recipients at different time points of harvest we could not observe any significant difference (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C,D</xref>). Of note, we observed that neutrophils from G-CSF-treated individuals could engulf beads even in the presence of the cytoskeleton inhibitor cytochalasin D, while phagocytic uptake of neutrophils from HSC donors 
 <italic>prior</italic> to G-CSF treatment was blocked as expected (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">S5</xref>). This may indicate that G-CSF renders neutrophils less susceptible against cytochalasin D. Notably, pH of surrounding medium was regularly controlled and did not change during the course of the experiments. In conclusion, ROS production and phagocytosis were not affected by G-CSF treatment.
