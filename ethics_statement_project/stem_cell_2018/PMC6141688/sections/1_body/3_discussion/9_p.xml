<p>Allogeneic transplant recipients are susceptible to infections (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). With a weakened immune system, often combined with immunosuppressive treatments, an infection can often be a fatal complication. To judge the immune status of patients at risk, it is still common practice to rely on the neutrophil count in blood. To the best of our knowledge, there is no clinical tool available to evaluate the functionality of innate immune cells. In our study, we show that neutrophils recruited by G-CSF treatment in healthy HSC donors displayed decreased functionality in chemotaxis. Notably, this decrease persisted temporarily in allogeneic transplant recipients after neutrophil engraftmentâ€”even though these patients did not receive G-CSF themselves. Therefore, we conclude that it is possible that G-CSF could have a similar effect on neutrophils in blood cancer patients undergoing G-CSF treatment. Our study provides evidence that this regimen might require reconsideration that is more thorough. Henceforth, our findings imply that chemotaxis is a sensitive neutrophil function, which seems to be impaired early on during treatment and disease. From another point of view, our results provide evidence that chemotaxis could serve as reporter for neutrophil functionality in the clinical setting. With this, our study serves as a promising starting point for future prospective studies on chemotaxis as functional marker related to infection risk in patients with hematological diseases and other patient groups receiving G-CSF as prophylactic treatment.
