<p>More strikingly, we demonstrate that reduced neutrophil chemotaxis persisted within the allogeneic transplant recipients at 2 weeks post HSC engraftment. The average life span of neutrophils in circulation is relatively short; it is estimated to be not longer than a few days (

 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). So, in these patients, the neutrophils analyzed did not stem from the first round of newly generated cells, but more likely from a following generation of neutrophils. Our findings are in good agreement with a study investigating neutrophil functions in autologous bone marrow transplantation recipients (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Humphreys et al. report decreased chemotaxis of neutrophils upon G-CSF treatment, which persisted until 2 weeks post engraftment (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Yet again, the effects observed were detected for neutrophils derived from HSCs from patients with a hematological disorder, and not, like in our case, from healthy HSC donors.
