<p>In our cohorts, ROS production and phagocytosis were not affected by systemic G-CSF treatment in healthy HSC donors or in allogeneic recipients. Oxidative burst and phagocytosis remained unchanged in all cohorts and at all time points of sampling. This specificity suggests that the reduced chemotaxis in our cohorts is not a result of general immaturity of neutrophils mediated by G-CSF as immaturity of neutrophils is usually accompanied by the impairment of other functions as well (

 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Scholl and coworkers, for instance, observed an impaired oxidative burst in neutrophils from allogeneic recipients when stimulating with

 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Macey and colleagues described impaired phagocytic ability of neutrophils after transplantation, however these patients received additional G-CSF treatment, which is in contrast to our study (
