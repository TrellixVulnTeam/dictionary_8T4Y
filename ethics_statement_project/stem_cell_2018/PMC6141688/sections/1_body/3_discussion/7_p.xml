<p>To judge whether reduced chemotaxis in neutrophils is a direct effect of the G-CSF present in blood, we have detected G-CSF plasma levels. Even in treated HSC donors, G-CSF plasma levels ranged around 1 ng/ml. Other studies have described slightly higher plasma concentrations ranging from 4 to &gt; 15 ng/ml (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments with purified neutrophils, 10 ng/ml G-CSF had no effect on neutrophil chemotaxis, only 50 ng/ml G-CSF impacted neutrophil chemotaxis. Taking this into consideration, our findings indicate that lower IL-8 and higher CRP concentrations in combination with a direct effect of G-CSF might render neutrophils less motile in G-CSF-treated individuals. Reduced IL-8 levels in plasma of G-CSF treated individuals could stem from non-neutrophil IL-8-sequestering cells.
