<p>In addition to reduced chemotaxis, we show that IL-8 plasma levels of HSC donors are reduced compared to untreated controls after G-CSF treatment. That decrease is contradictory to a study by Watanabe et al. where the authors reported elevated levels of IL-8 after G-CSF-treatment even though the G-CSF treatment regimen was virtually identical to our donors (

 <sup>+</sup> cells that are used as a measure for HSC mobilization. Again, this is in contrast with our findings: We could not detect any correlation between IL-8 levels and amount of harvested CD34+ cells or the neutrophil count in circulation. Since IL-8 is pivotal for neutrophil chemotaxis, we conclude that the significant reduction of IL-8 plasma levels might contribute also to reduced chemotaxis of neutrophils. However, it remains unclear, which cells are responsible for IL-8 production under these conditions.
