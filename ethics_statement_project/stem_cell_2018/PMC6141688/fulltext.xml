Thus, blood neutrophil counts serve as a measure for the immune system's functionality. Hematological patients often have low neutrophil counts due to disease or chemotherapy. To increase neutrophil counts and thereby preventing infections in high-risk patients, recombinant G-CSF is widely used as adjunct therapy to stimulate the maturation of neutrophils. In addition, G-CSF is utilized to recruit stem cells (SCs) into the peripheral blood of SC donors. Still, the actual functionality of neutrophils resulting from G-CSF treatment remains insufficiently understood. We tested the <italic>ex vivo</italic> functionality of neutrophils isolated from blood of G-CSF-treated healthy SC donors. We quantified chemotaxis, oxidative burst, and phagocytosis before and after treatment and detected significantly reduced chemotactic activity upon G-CSF treatment. Similarly, <italic>in vitro</italic> treatment of previously untreated neutrophils with G-CSF led to reduced chemotactic activity. In addition, we revealed that this effect persists in the allogeneic SC recipients up to 4 weeks after neutrophil engraftment. Our data indicates that neutrophil quantity, as a sole measure of immunocompetence in high-risk patients should be considered cautiously as neutrophil functionality might be affected by the primary treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>neutrophil</kwd><kwd>granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)</kwd><kwd>allogeneic transplant</kwd><kwd>chemotaxis</kwd><kwd>hematopoietic stem cell donor</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Cancer Research Foundation in Northern Sweden<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100004886</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">AMP 11-684</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">LP 10-1833</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">V&#x000e4;sterbotten L&#x000e4;ns Landsting<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002960</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn003">Ume&#x000e5; Universitet<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100004885</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn003">316-886-10</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="59"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="7896"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neutrophils are the most common leukocytes in blood and constitute 50&#x02013;70% of the white blood cells corresponding to an absolute neutrophil count of 1.8-7.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/l blood (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). As part of the first line of defense they immediately migrate to the site of an infection following gradients of chemoattractants released by tissue-dwelling, pathogen sensing cells (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Like macrophages, neutrophils are professional phagocytes. However, unlike macrophages, they are loaded with preformed granules containing antimicrobial effector molecules (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This allows neutrophils to kill invading microbes very efficiently. During phagocytosis, neutrophils engulf microbes into the phagosome that subsequently fuses with granules to form an antimicrobial environment that toxifies microorganisms by reactive oxygen species (ROS), antimicrobial peptides and proteins (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). To eradicate microbes in the extracellular milieu neutrophils either degranulate antimicrobial effectors into the extracellular milieu (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) or deliver their effectors embedded into a web-like structure, known as neutrophil extracellular traps (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Clinically relevant neutropenia and severe neutropenia are defined by neutrophil counts below 1.5&#x02013;2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/l or 0.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/l, respectively (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Neutropenia occurs transiently or chronically in a variety of diseases and disorders and renders individuals more susceptible to infections (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). A major group at risk for neutropenia are patients treated for hematological malignancies: Chemo- and radiation therapy often affect hematopoiesis, thereby reducing neutrophil production (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Furthermore, immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine or mycophenolate can depress neutrophil counts (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Accordingly, persistent neutropenia is a known risk factor for invasive bacterial and fungal infections after receiving a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplant (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Today, the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is widely used as a prophylactic treatment to counteract neutropenia and to prevent infections, for instance, in patients undergoing systemic chemotherapy (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). However, studies on lymphoma patients revealed that G-CSF given as primary prophylaxis could not increase overall survival or reduce infection-related mortality (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Another study on patients undergoing HSC transplantation while receiving G-CSF treatment showed a slightly decreased infection rate but no difference in treatment-related mortality (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). HSCs are transplanted either by autologous or allogeneic routes into patients suffering from different malignant and non-malignant hematopoetic disorders, for instance, acute myeloid leukemia, myeloma, or thalassemia major (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). To increase the number of pluripotent cells in peripheral blood, the donors receive G-CSF prior to the process of harvesting HSCs from peripheral blood (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Concomitantly, the numbers of circulating neutrophils increase. Naturally, the cytokine G-CSF is a major factor controlling the development and function of neutrophils (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). G-CSF regulates proliferation, maturation, survival, and functional activation of these cells (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). During the course of an infection, serum levels of G-CSF increase which in turn enhances proliferation of granulocytic precursor cells and an increased level of circulating neutrophils (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In our study we aimed to analyze the quality of neutrophils resulting from G-CSF-treatment. We investigated key neutrophil functions in cells isolated from blood of healthy individuals recruited as HSC donors before and after G-CSF treatment as well as from allogeneic HSC recipients at different time points after receiving the HSC graft from G-CSF-treated donors. While oxidative burst and phagocytosis were unaffected in all these samples, chemotaxis was significantly reduced upon treatment with G-CSF. Strikingly, impaired chemotaxis was detectable in neutrophils from HSC recipients up to 4 weeks post engraftment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Ethical statement</title><p>Ethical approval (register number 09-210M, project number CFU-12/09) for the study was obtained from the Regional Ethical Review Board, Ume&#x000e5;, Sweden.

As expected, the total neutrophil count increased in the blood of these individuals ~ 9-fold upon treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). When analyzing the neutrophils <italic>ex vivo</italic>, we detected that neutrophils isolated from HSC donors after G-CSF-treatment displayed significantly increased half migration time and a reduced velocity at half migration time compared to neutrophils before treatment (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B,C</xref>).

In summary, chemotaxis of neutrophils from HSC donors after G-CSF-treatment was reduced compared to neutrophils from the same individuals before treatment. This suggests that G-CSF administration in healthy HSC donors could reduce the ability of circulating neutrophils to migrate upon chemotactic stimulation. Of note, the number of immature neutrophils, so-called band cells, was negligibly small below 2% before and after G-CSF treatment in both, full blood and neutrophil isolation fractions (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D,E</xref>) as determined by a complete blood differentiation analysis.

Interleukin 8 (IL-8) is a central chemokine for neutrophil recruitment contributing to the extravasation of neutrophils to the site of infection (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase serum protein of hepatic origin, has been previously implicated to suppress neutrophil chemotaxis <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). We therefore, analyzed plasma samples from HSC donors, taken before and after G-CSF treatment, for IL-8 and CRP levels. To reveal possible correlations, we also quantified plasma levels of G-CSF. After treatment, G-CSF concentrations were significantly increased, 1042 pg/ml compared to 8 pg/ml before treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Notably, we observed a significant decrease of IL-8 in plasma of G-CSF-treated individuals as compared to the samples taken before treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).

To confirm actual phagocytosis, we included neutrophils treated with cytochalasin D as a negative control. Cytochalasin D inhibits cytoskeleton rearrangements and thus allows discrimination between adherence and phagocytosis. When comparing the phagocytic uptake by neutrophils from HSC donors before and after G-CSF treatment as well as the neutrophils from the allogeneic transplant recipients at different time points of harvest we could not observe any significant difference (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C,D</xref>).

Instead of harvesting bone marrow surgically from the pelvis bone, which requires, e.g., general anesthesia, the cells of interest are collected from the peripheral blood. Yet again, there is growing evidence that G-CSF treatment alters more physiological functions than the blood cell count (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Our study analyzed key neutrophil functions, i.e., chemotaxis, ROS production, and phagocytosis, in isolated neutrophils from the peripheral blood of HSC donors and allogeneic transplant recipients by using well-established <italic>in vitro</italic> stimuli and assays. The individuals included in our study received standard dosages of G-CSF (10 &#x003bc;g/kg/d) and the resulting plasma concentrations were in the expected ranges (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). As expected, G-CSF treatment substantially increased the number of neutrophils in the circulation. When analyzing the functionality of these neutrophils, we revealed that if derived from healthy HSC donors treated with G-CSF, the cells showed reduced <italic>ex vivo</italic> chemotaxis toward fMLF. Other key functions tested, i.e., ROS production and phagocytosis, seemed to remain unaltered. Strikingly, the chemotactic impairment observed in neutrophils from HSC donors persisted in the group of allogeneic transplant recipients. Even after transplantation and novel granulopoiesis within the transplant recipient, newly emerging neutrophils showed the same migration defect as the neutrophils from the HSC donors. Of note, the recipients themselves received no prophylactic G-CSF. According to our data, it took several weeks until normal neutrophil activity was regained. Notably, we observed the chemotactic impairment even though the allogeneic transplant recipient group was heterogeneously composed with diversity regarding the underlying disease. Nevertheless, these patients frequently receive immunosuppressive therapy, such as steroids or calcineurin inhibitors, which in turn were shown to impair neutrophil functions. However, the effects of these type of drugs are usually pleiotropic and do not specifically target neutrophil chemotaxis. For instance, calcineurin inhibitors can impair chemokinesis of neutrophils on vitronectin (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), reduce oxidative burst induced by fMLF (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) and diminish phagocytic activity (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Further, the content of immature neutrophils was &#x0003c;2% in both, full blood and neutrophil isolation fractions&#x02014;even after G-CSF treatment.</p><p>Our results confirm previous studies describing impaired neutrophil functionality in allogeneic transplant recipients. Sosa et al. reported that neutrophil chemotaxis is impaired up to 4 months after HSC transplantation (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) and Katoh et al. observed a decrease in chemotactic activity for up to 12 months (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Azzara et al. even pointed toward a reduced motility of neutrophils from chemotherapy patients treated with G-CSF (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Still, these studies were performed with neutrophils from cancer patients while we also included otherwise healthy HSC donors yet observed similar abnormalities. This implies that G-CSF treatment in general affects neutrophils and is supported by Kerst et al. who described phenotypically and functionally altered neutrophils upon G-CSF treatment in healthy donors (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Few studies addressed the impact of G-CSF administration on neutrophils in healthy individuals, in our case HSC donors. Dale and coworkers investigated the combined impact of G-CSF and corticosteroids on neutrophil function (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), whereas H&#x000f6;glund and colleagues similar to our study investigated the singular effect of G-CSF (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). The authors observed a reduced migratory activity of neutrophils after several doses of G-CSF and the transient nature of this effect, as it disappeared several weeks after treatment. Our study confirms and extends on these findings, since we directly combine investigations of healthy HSC donors with allogeneic transplant recipients as well as linking our observations to CRP and IL-8 levels and direct <italic>in vitro</italic> effects as discussed in more detail below. Interestingly, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies triggering neutrophils directly with G-CSF observed a rapid stimulation of random mobility that declined within about half an hour (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). In our experiments showing reduced mobility due to G-CSF treatment, neutrophils were incubated with G-CSF for that same amount of time and subsequently challenged with fMLF to induce active movement. Taken together, these observations suggest a possible &#x0201c;exhaustion&#x0201d; of chemotactic potential due to random mobility if neutrophils are directly challenged with G-CSF. Notably, in our study, reduced <italic>in vitro</italic> chemotaxis did unlikely result from decreased surface exposure of the fMLF receptor.</p><p>More strikingly, we demonstrate that reduced neutrophil chemotaxis persisted within the allogeneic transplant recipients at 2 weeks post HSC engraftment. The average life span of neutrophils in circulation is relatively short; it is estimated to be not longer than a few days (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). So, in these patients, the neutrophils analyzed did not stem from the first round of newly generated cells, but more likely from a following generation of neutrophils. Our findings are in good agreement with a study investigating neutrophil functions in autologous bone marrow transplantation recipients (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Humphreys et al. report decreased chemotaxis of neutrophils upon G-CSF treatment, which persisted until 2 weeks post engraftment (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Yet again, the effects observed were detected for neutrophils derived from HSCs from patients with a hematological disorder, and not, like in our case, from healthy HSC donors.</p><p>In addition to reduced chemotaxis, we show that IL-8 plasma levels of HSC donors are reduced compared to untreated controls after G-CSF treatment. That decrease is contradictory to a study by Watanabe et al. where the authors reported elevated levels of IL-8 after G-CSF-treatment even though the G-CSF treatment regimen was virtually identical to our donors (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Moreover, this study showed a correlation between the IL-8 levels and the amount of harvested CD34<sup>+</sup> cells that are used as a measure for HSC mobilization. Again, this is in contrast with our findings: We could not detect any correlation between IL-8 levels and amount of harvested CD34+ cells or the neutrophil count in circulation. Since IL-8 is pivotal for neutrophil chemotaxis, we conclude that the significant reduction of IL-8 plasma levels might contribute also to reduced chemotaxis of neutrophils. However, it remains unclear, which cells are responsible for IL-8 production under these conditions.</p><p>Neutrophils are crucial for the innate immunity. G-CSF is therefore used in neutropenic patients as a preventive treatment to avoid infections. Still, a study with transplant recipients reported that preventive G-CSF treatment did not alter infection-related mortality in these patients (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). While this supports the relevance of reduced neutrophil functionality, i.e., the ability to reach the site of infection <italic>in vivo</italic> by chemotaxis, others described an unchanged infection risk in G-CSF-treated HSC donors (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Taken together, this suggests a potential compensation by number if neutrophil functionality is reduced.</p><p>Previously, it was shown that CRP levels increased upon G-CSF treatment (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Our data confirms this finding. Moreover, our observations provide a possible link between increased CRP plasma levels in G-CSF-treated individuals and a negative effect on neutrophil chemotaxis. Of note, CRP reduced the chemotactic ability of neutrophils <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p><p>To judge whether reduced chemotaxis in neutrophils is a direct effect of the G-CSF present in blood, we have detected G-CSF plasma levels. Even in treated HSC donors, G-CSF plasma levels ranged around 1 ng/ml. Other studies have described slightly higher plasma concentrations ranging from 4 to &#x0003e; 15 ng/ml (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments with purified neutrophils, 10 ng/ml G-CSF had no effect on neutrophil chemotaxis, only 50 ng/ml G-CSF impacted neutrophil chemotaxis. Taking this into consideration, our findings indicate that lower IL-8 and higher CRP concentrations in combination with a direct effect of G-CSF might render neutrophils less motile in G-CSF-treated individuals. Reduced IL-8 levels in plasma of G-CSF treated individuals could stem from non-neutrophil IL-8-sequestering cells.</p><p>In our cohorts, ROS production and phagocytosis were not affected by systemic G-CSF treatment in healthy HSC donors or in allogeneic recipients. Oxidative burst and phagocytosis remained unchanged in all cohorts and at all time points of sampling. This specificity suggests that the reduced chemotaxis in our cohorts is not a result of general immaturity of neutrophils mediated by G-CSF as immaturity of neutrophils is usually accompanied by the impairment of other functions as well (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). It should be mentioned that other studies investigating neutrophil function of allogeneic recipients as reviewed by Ramaprasad et al. reported effects on ROS production or phagocytosis (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Scholl and coworkers, for instance, observed an impaired oxidative burst in neutrophils from allogeneic recipients when stimulating with <italic>E. coli</italic>, but not when stimulating with PMA, confirming our findings (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Macey and colleagues described impaired phagocytic ability of neutrophils after transplantation, however these patients received additional G-CSF treatment, which is in contrast to our study (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>).</p><p>Allogeneic transplant recipients are susceptible to infections (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). With a weakened immune system, often combined with immunosuppressive treatments, an infection can often be a fatal complication. To judge the immune status of patients at risk, it is still common practice to rely on the neutrophil count in blood. To the best of our knowledge, there is no clinical tool available to evaluate the functionality of innate immune cells. In our study, we show that neutrophils recruited by G-CSF treatment in healthy HSC donors displayed decreased functionality in chemotaxis. Notably, this decrease persisted temporarily in allogeneic transplant recipients after neutrophil engraftment&#x02014;even though these patients did not receive G-CSF themselves. Therefore, we conclude that it is possible that G-CSF could have a similar effect on neutrophils in blood cancer patients undergoing G-CSF treatment. Our study provides evidence that this regimen might require reconsideration that is more thorough. Henceforth, our findings imply that chemotaxis is a sensitive neutrophil function, which seems to be impaired early on during treatment and disease. From another point of view, our results provide evidence that chemotaxis could serve as reporter for neutrophil functionality in the clinical setting.
