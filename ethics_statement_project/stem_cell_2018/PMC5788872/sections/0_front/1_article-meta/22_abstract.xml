 <p>Feasibility, tolerance, and safety of intravenous infusions of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy in lung transplant recipients with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) are not well established. MSCs were manufactured, cryopreserved, transported to our facility, thawed, and infused into nine recipients with moderate BOS (average drop in forced expiratory volume in 1 second was 56.8% ± 3.2% from post‐transplant peak) who were refractory to standard therapy and not candidates for retransplant. Cells were viable and sterile prior to infusion. Patients received a single infusion of either 1 (
  <italic>n</italic> = 3), 2 (
  <italic>n</italic> = 3), or 4 (
  <italic>n</italic> = 3) million MSCs per kg. Patients were medically evaluated before; during; and at 24 hours, 1 week, and 1 month after infusion for evidence of infusion‐related adverse events and tolerance of therapy. Vital signs, pulmonary function test results, Borg Dyspnea Index, and routine laboratory data were recorded. Vital signs and O
  <sub>2</sub> saturation did not significantly change during or up to 2 hours after MSC infusion. There were no significant changes in gas exchange variables, pulmonary function test results, or laboratory values at 1, 7, and 30 days postinfusion compared with preinfusion values. Infusion of MSCs in patients with BOS was feasible, safe, and well tolerated and did not produce any significant adverse changes in clinical, functional, or laboratory variables during or up to 30 days after infusion. Manufacturing, transport, and administration of intravenous, allogeneic bone marrow‐derived MSCs in doses from 1 to 4 million MSCs per kg is safe in lung transplant recipients with BOS. S
