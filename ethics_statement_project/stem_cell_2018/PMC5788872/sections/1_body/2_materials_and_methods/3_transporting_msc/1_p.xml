<p>Shipping studies were performed to verify transporting cryopreserved MSCs between the manufacturing facility (Waisman Biomanufacturing at the University of Wisconsin‐Madison) and the clinical site (Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida) did not adversely impact MSC quality. It was discovered that some of the cell product bags were broken, prompting a change in thawing protocol. Because of the risk of MSC clumping and sedimentation during infusion, especially in the high‐dose group, a pilot experiment was performed, which led to adjustment and determination of the final cell concentration with least clumping and sedimentation. Similarly, dimethyl sulfoxide content was adjusted to a minimum while maintaining maximal post‐thaw viability. To ensure stability of the MSCs during infusion, pre‐ and postinfusion viability assessments were performed. Cells were thawed and diluted following an approved Standard Operating Procedure. The thawed, diluted cells were held at room temperature and samples were removed each hour over a 4‐hour period and assessed for recovery, clumping, and viability (Trypan Blue). MSC viability was &gt;88% for all time points in all replicate studies. Studies were repeated with the thaw and viable cell count performed at the Mayo Clinic Cell Therapy Laboratory (Jacksonville, FL) with a viability &gt;84%.</p>
