<p>Infusion of MSCs was performed in the clinical apheresis unit. MSCs were infused at a rate of 2–3 mL/minute during the first 15 minutes, with the option to be adjusted up to 5 mL/minute if tolerated. Patients were monitored for any adverse reaction. Infusion toxicity was evaluated by continuously monitoring the patient's vital signs, electrocardiogram, and O
 <sub>2</sub> saturation by pulse oximetry before, during, and up to 2 hours after MSC infusion. The dose of MSC infusion was chosen using an incremental protocol: the initial three patients assigned to group 1 received an infusion dose of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> MSCs per kg; three patients assigned to group 2 received an infusion dose of 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> MSCs per kg; and the final three patients in group 3 received an infusion dose of 4 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> MSCs per kg.
