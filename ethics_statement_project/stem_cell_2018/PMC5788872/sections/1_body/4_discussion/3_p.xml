<p>Given the wide array of possible immunomodulatory and anti‐inflammatory properties of MSCs, it is appealing to consider their use to prevent primary graft dysfunction and prevent or treat acute or chronic rejection. In a study by McAuley et al.

Alveolar fluid clearance was increased to a normal level in lungs receiving MSCs, suggesting that this therapy can enhance the resolution of pulmonary edema in human lungs deemed unsuitable for transplantation
