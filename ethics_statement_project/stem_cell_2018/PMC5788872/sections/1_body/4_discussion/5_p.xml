<p>Although this study was designed to treat patients with obstructive CLAD refractory to medical therapy, knowing that this therapy is feasible and safe presents the opportunity for future studies into MSC infusion for management of acute graft failure or early administration of either autologous or allogeneic MSCs after transplant to prevent severe primary graft dysfunction, which is known to be associated with early mortality and late morbidity. Because of the immunomodulatory properties of MSCs, administration of MSCs early after transplant could help reduce the need for heavy immunosuppressive therapy, thus decreasing the consequent high incidence of infectious complications and multiple adverse events associated with administration of calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids.</p>
