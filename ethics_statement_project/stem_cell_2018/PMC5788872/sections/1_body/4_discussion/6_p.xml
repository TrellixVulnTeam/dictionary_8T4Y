<p>Based on recent advances in ex vivo lung perfusion technology 
 <xref rid="sct312264-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> and the results of MSC infusion reported here and by Chambers et al. 
 <xref rid="sct312264-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>, further studies into combining these therapies may be warranted. Donor lungs could be placed on ex vivo lung perfusion prior to transplantation, to infuse them with previously cultured autologous or allogeneic bone marrow‚Äêderived MSCs, aiming to immunomodulate the donor lungs to reduce the incidence of primary graft dysfunction. Future and larger phase II studies will be required to confirm our preliminary findings to better define the role of cell therapy as a potential early immunomodulatory or rescue therapy for lung transplant recipients with acute or chronic rejection.
