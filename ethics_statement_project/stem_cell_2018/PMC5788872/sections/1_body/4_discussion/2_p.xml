<p>Tan et al. 
 <xref rid="sct312264-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> reported use of bone marrow‐derived autologous MSCs as a replacement of antibody induction for patients with end‐stage renal disease undergoing kidney transplantation from a living related donor. Patients received 1–2 million MSCs per kg at kidney perfusion and 2 weeks later with standard or reduced calcineurin inhibitors compared with a control group.

This group reported lower incidence of adverse events for these patients compared with controls
