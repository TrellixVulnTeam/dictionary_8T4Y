<p>The process of freezing, transporting, and thawing MSCs did not affect their viability: 92.4% ± 2.6% were viable prior to infusion and 93.0% ± 3.28% were found to be viable at the end of infusion (Table 
 <xref rid="sct312264-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap">3</xref>). Group 1 received an average of 1.09 million MSCs per kg, group 2 an average of 2.50 million MSCs per kg, and group 3 an average of 3.93 million MSCs per kg. The median volume of infused product was 197 mL (range, 97–397 mL). All post‐thaw sterility cultures were negative (Table
