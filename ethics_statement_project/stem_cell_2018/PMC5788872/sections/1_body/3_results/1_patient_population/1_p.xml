<p>Nine patients (seven men, two women) who were recipients of double lung transplant (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) or single lung transplant (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) were included. Their advanced age (69 ± 5 years) was likely influenced by the study design excluding younger patients who could qualify for retransplant. Their mean FEV
 <sub>1</sub> prior to MSC infusion was 56.8% ± 3.2% (range 53%–62%) from the peak achieved after transplant, corresponding to a 43.1% ± 3.4% drop (range 38%–47% drop) consistent with moderate BOS. Indications for single lung transplant were COPD (3) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (1). Indications for double lung transplant were idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (2), COPD (1), primary ciliary dyskinesia (1) and one patient retransplanted for BOS. These patients had survived an average of 7.5 ± 3 years after transplant and had been clinically diagnosed with moderate BOS a median of 5 years after transplant. They were all on triple immunosuppressive therapy: prednisone, mycophenolate (6) or azathioprine (3), and tacrolimus (8) or cyclosporine (1). They had all received enhanced immunosuppressive therapy with steroid boluses (9), methotrexate (5), Rapamune (sirolimus; Pfizer, New York City, NY,

One patient had received a retransplant for BOS. They were all receiving azithromycin, proton pump inhibitors, and statin therapy.
