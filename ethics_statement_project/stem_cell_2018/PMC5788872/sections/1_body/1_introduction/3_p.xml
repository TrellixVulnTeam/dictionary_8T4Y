<p>In vivo models have demonstrated that MSCs have the capacity to engraft into lung tissue. Multiple studies indicate that intravenous administration of MSC therapy will preferentially engraft in the lung in the presence of an inflammatory process, which occurs in BOS and pulmonary fibrosis

 <xref rid="sct312264-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>. Once implanted, MSCs are capable of interacting with the surrounding microenvironment and are believed to facilitate regeneration of neighboring tissue by secreting various factors and renewing biologic functions, such as the immune system, or act directly to support and revive cell function and repair damage 
 <xref rid="sct312264-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>. Human trials that utilize MSCs to treat disease conditions such as graft‐versus‐host disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have similar pathology to BOS and have shown good tolerance with no significant adverse events

 <xref rid="sct312264-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>. Intravenously infused cells are naturally trapped in the lung with few cells reaching systemic circulation, a phenomenon called pulmonary first‐pass effect 
 <xref rid="sct312264-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, which provides easy access of therapeutic cells to the pathology site. Infused MSCs may participate in repair of the native lung, thereby inducing immune‐modulatory effect in the transplanted lung. Infusion of human MSCs in doses as high as 5.6 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> MSCs per kg were not associated with any documentable adverse events in a rat model of lung injury induced by bleomycin
