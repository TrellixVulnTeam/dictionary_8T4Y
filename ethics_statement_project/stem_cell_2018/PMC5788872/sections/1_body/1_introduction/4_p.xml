<p>In this pilot study, we evaluated the safety and feasibility of administering allogeneic bone marrow‐derived MSCs with the intent of inducing remission of moderate treatment‐refractory BOS. Lung transplant recipients who had progressed to moderate BOS, despite maximal medical therapy, and who did not qualify for a retransplantation, received intravenous infusion of allogeneic MSCs. Safety of the therapy was evaluated, including tolerance of MSC infusion and absence of notable cardiopulmonary compromise. Feasibility was also evaluated, including ease of recruitment and practical issues of transporting, preparing, and infusing MSCs.</p>
