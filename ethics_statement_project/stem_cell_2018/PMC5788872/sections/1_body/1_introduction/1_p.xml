<p>Lung transplant patients with treatment refractory moderate (grade 2) bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) who do not qualify for a second transplant are at high risk of mortality or extreme disability. BOS is a subtype of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) and is defined by progressive decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV
 <sub>1</sub>) following the highest FEV
 <sub>1</sub> achieved post‐transplant, not explained by acute rejection, acute infection, or stenotic airways

 <xref rid="sct312264-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>. The mortality rate associated with BOS ranges from 25% to 56%; the risk increases with time after diagnosis 
 <xref rid="sct312264-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>. Although a variety of therapies have been tried for BOS, there is no standardized therapeutic protocol. Large doses of steroids, enhanced immunosuppression, azithromycin, statin administration, antireflux medical therapy or surgical fundoplication, photopheresis, and other therapies have been tried with variable success. BOS is the most common indication for retransplantation, although this is a controversial alternative with increased mortality 
 <xref rid="sct312264-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. One review examined the outcome of 230 cases of retransplantation performed in 47 centers between 1985 and 1996 [5]. The review showed 1‐year survival was only 47%.
