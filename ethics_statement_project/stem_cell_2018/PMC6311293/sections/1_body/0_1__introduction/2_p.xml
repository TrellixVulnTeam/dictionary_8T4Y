<p>Radiation injury (radioinjury) of the hippocampus is a phenomenon described from preclinical experiments and clinical observations, with radiotherapy doses as low as 2 Gy leading to changes in neural progenitor cells residing within hippocampal neurogenic niches and being involved in memory formation [
