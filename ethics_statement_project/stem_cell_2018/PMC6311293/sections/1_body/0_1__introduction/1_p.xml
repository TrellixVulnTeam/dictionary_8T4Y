<p>The paradigm of palliative radiotherapy of brain metastases (BM) has been recently shifting towards strengthen the quality of life (QoL), especially neurocognitive functions [

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For better preservation of neurocognition, stereotactic radiotherapy has become the currently recommended approach both in upfront treatment of limited brain metastases [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] as well as in postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy [

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Apart from local stereotactic radiotherapy, many other strategies, including administration of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine, are being investigated in order to mitigate the well-known adverse iatrogenic effects of classical whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), which has been utilized for decades as a simple, cheap, and widely available treatment of BM [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Hippocampal sparing during WBRT is a recent modification of radiotherapy that provides a low risk of adverse events with appropriate local and distal brain control [
