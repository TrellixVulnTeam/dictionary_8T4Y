<p>Spatial distribution of BM is summarized in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Most patients presented with frontal lobe BM (154/260 patients; 59.2%). The most common localization of BM was also frontal lobe with mean 6.25 BM and median 2 BM within frontal lobes. Within left and right temporal lobes, there was a mean of 1.48 and 2.57 BM and median of 1 and 1 BM. Eight percent of patients (20/260 patients) had BM within hippocampi and 18% of patients (47/260 patients) within HAZ. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of patients who had more BM in the right (9 patients) versus the left (8 patients) hippocampus. Similarly, no significant difference was observed in the number of patients with involvement of right (20 patients) versus left (22 patients) HAZ (p = 0.88). There was also no difference in the number of BM within right and left hippocampus (p = 0.57) or within right and left HAZ (p = 0.91).
