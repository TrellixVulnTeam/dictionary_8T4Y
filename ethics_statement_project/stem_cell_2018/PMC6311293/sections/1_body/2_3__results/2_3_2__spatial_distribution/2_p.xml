<p>Furthermore, the presence of centre of a mass of BM within hippocampi and HAZ was evaluated. Five patients (5/260; 1.9%) developed BM whose centre was located within hippocampus and 9.6% of patients (25/260 patients) within HAZ. Higher number of patients developed more metastases whose centre was within left HAZ (15 patients) comparing to right HAZ (6 patients), approaching the borderline of statistical significance with p = 0.07. Four patients had the same number of metastases within left and right HAZ. Further details are summarized in
