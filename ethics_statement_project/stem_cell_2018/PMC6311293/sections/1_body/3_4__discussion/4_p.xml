<p>The analysis presented here is the first large study focused on the laterality of hippocampal BM involvement. It contributes to the field by providing important knowledge needed before initiating programs of unilateral (left) hippocampus sparing during WBRT, which may be sufficient to preserve verbal memory, the most commonly affected neurocognitive domain following brain irradiation. Of course, evaluation of general QoL and of another neurocognitive domains related to the right (nondominant) side of brain would be needed in the trial where bilateral versus unilateral hippocampal sparing during WBRT would be tested. With the hypothesized noninferiority of unilateral sparing, there would be a possible advantage of about 50% reduction in the risk of subsequent recurrence within spared regions based on our current observation of no significant difference in the laterality of BM seeding. Moreover, unilateral hippocampal avoiding leads to dosimetrically increased sparing of preserved hippocampus [
