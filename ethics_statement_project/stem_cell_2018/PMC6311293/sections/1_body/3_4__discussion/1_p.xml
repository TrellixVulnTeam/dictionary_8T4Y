<p>No significant difference in the laterality of BM seeding within hippocampus was observed in this large retrospective study. Nevertheless, normative standards are not known and, thus, before the start of this study, it was not possible to estimate the sample size needed to reach statistical significance with sufficient power. However, we believe that the lack of significance that we observed in the analysis of 260 patients indicates that there is truly no difference in the laterality of hippocampal BM involvement.</p>
