<p>Several previous retrospective studies described perihippocampal incidence of BM [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Earlier studies focused on a general estimation of perihippocampal BM incidence, while further trials aimed at assessing some specific aspect such as the measurement of the distance of BM from hippocampi in Harth
 <italic> et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] or the determination of the number of brain metastases in patients with melanoma [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] or breast cancer [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Nevertheless, no studies have specified laterality of BM location. Data from all previous studies indicate that hippocampi are a rare site of BM and that hippocampus avoiding WBRT is a safe procedure with low risk of undertreatment in hippocampi or HAZ. A construction of HAZ during radiotherapy planning is needed to generate a dose gradient fallout from the surrounding brain (irradiated to the full prescribed dose), but delivered dose within HAZ might be insufficient to control micrometastases.
