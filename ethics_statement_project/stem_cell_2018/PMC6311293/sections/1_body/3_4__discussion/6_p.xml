<p>In conclusion, a relatively high incidence of perihippocampal BM was observed in our large retrospective study with no clear difference in the laterality of BM seeding within the hippocampus. Spatial patterns of failure in ongoing phase III trials, where the role of hippocampal avoiding WBRT is being assessed, may reveal true laterality of hippocampal recurrence rate and further support the proposed testing of unilateral hippocampal sparing during WBRT.</p>
