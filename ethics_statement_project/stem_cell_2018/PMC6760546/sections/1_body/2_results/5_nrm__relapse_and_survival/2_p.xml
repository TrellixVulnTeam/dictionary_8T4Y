<p id="Par21">Seventeen out of 18 patients with active disease achieved CR after transplantation. With a median follow-up of 7 months (range, 2−12 months), six cases relapsed. All the six patients were in disease active status with blasts from 6 to 18% at the time of transplantation. Four of five patients with normal cytogenetics had DNMT3-A mutation (one case), NRAS mutation (two cases), and MLL-AF9 rearrangement (one case), respectively. One patient with ALL had cytogenetic abnormalities with 46xy, der(3), der(9). The median time of relapse was 4.5 (3−10) months. One patient achieved the second CR (CR2) and was still alive after chemotherapy followed by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) for 5 months. Two patients were still in treatment. All other three patients died from relapse without treatment (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The 1-year probability of relapse was 25.1% (95% CI, 7.3−42.9%) for all patients (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The 1-year probabilities of DFS and OS were 59% (95% CI, 33.3−84.7%) and 78.4% (95% CI, 63−93.8%), respectively (Fig.
