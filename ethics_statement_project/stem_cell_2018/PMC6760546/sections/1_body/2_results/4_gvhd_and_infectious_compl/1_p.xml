<p id="Par19">The CI of grades II-IV aGvHD was 19.4% (95% CI, 5.5–33.3%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) and grades III-IV aGvHD was 6.9% (95% CI 0–16.3%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>) within 100 days after transplantation. The frequencies of aGVHD at day +100 and +180 were same due to no patient suffering from late onset aGVHD. The grade II aGvHD involvement of isolated skin occurred in two patients, while skin and gut in two patients. The grade III aGvHD involvement of gut and skin occurred in one patient, while skin and liver in another patient. No patient developed grade IV aGvHD. All six cases with aGvHD received systemic corticosteroids (methylprednisolone (MP) with 2 mg/kg/d). Two of them required secondary treatment with anti-CD25 mAbs (basiliximab, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) because of refractory to primary therapy and both got complete remission. The CIs of moderate-to-severe cGvHD within 6 months were 18.8% (5/27 cases, four with moderate cGVHD and one with severe cGVHD (95% CI, 3.933.7%)) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). No patient died from acute and chronic GvHD. The CIs of CMV and EBV reactivation by day +180 were 37.5% (12 cases) (95% CI, 19.8−55.2%) and 40.6% (13 cases) (95% CI, 22.6−58.6%) respectively. Six patients suffered from pneumonia (bacterial pneumonia in one patient, aspergillus pneumonia in three patients, CMV pneumonia in one patient and pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in one patient). One patient was diagnosed as PTLD at 3 months after transplantation and died from aspergillus pneumonia (Table
