 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Twenty-two patients were included in immune reconstitution studies and 15 cases were analyzed at each endpoint. On day +100 and +120, median CD3

 <sup>+</sup> counts were 1117 (442−2136) and 1239 (494−2117), 104 (31−159) and 240 (201−487), 780 (310−1914) and 939 (366−1614), 12 (6−42) and 20 (10−145), 224 (78−1961) and 217 (64−1680)/μl, respectively. Since 120 days after transplantation, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cell counts were all above 200/μl and reached nearly 400/μl on +210 days.
