<p id="Par17">All patients received G-CSF mobilized PBSC with MNCs 15.5 (7.5−28.3)×10
 <sup>8</sup>/kg and CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells 13.39 (2.4−31.7)×10
 <sup>6</sup>/kg. The median nuclear cell number and CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell number of unrelated third-party cord blood were 2.1 (1.4−4.14)×10
 <sup>7</sup>/kg and 5.6 (1.52−11.2)×10
 <sup>4</sup>/kg, respectively. The median time for neutrophil engraftment was 12 days (range 9−20) for patients with primary engraftment; whereas the median time for platelet engraftment was observed in 16 days (range 12−25). The results of chimerism monitoring showed that all of these patients were fully donor chimerism when assessed between days 14 and 28 after transplantation. Primary graft failure occurred in one patient (3.1%) with CMML who received lower CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell number of 2.4×10
 <sup>6</sup>/kg. One patient with AML experienced secondary graft failure after CMV pneumonia at day 90. There was no chimerism of cord blood cells in all patients on day 14 after transplantation.
