<p id="Par15">The primary endpoint was the CIs of aGvHD within 100 days after Haplo-PBSCT. The secondary endpoint was the engraftment (leukocyte and platelet engraftment, donor chimerism), NRM, cGvHD, the CIs of relapse (CIRs), OS, disease-free survival (DFS), CIs of CMV viremia and CMV-associated diseases, EBV viremia and PTLDs. Only patients with successful ANC engraftment were evaluated for aGVHD and cGVHD was evaluated only in patients with a minimum follow-up of 100 days. CIR was calculated from the date of allo-HSCT or the date of getting CR after transplantation until relapse. The response criteria for CR and relapse were defined according to the literature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Primary refractory disease was defined as the failure of achieving CR after two cycles of initial induction chemotherapy or hematologic relapse within 6 months from the beginning of initial therapy. Secondary refractory disease was defined as relapse from CR and had no response to salvage chemotherapy. NRM was defined as death without evidence of disease relapse. All statistical tests were two-sided and
