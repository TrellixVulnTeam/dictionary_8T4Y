<p id="Par10">The GvHD prophylaxis consisted of ATG 2.5 mg/kg administered on day −2 to −1 and cyclophosphamide (Cy) 50 mg/kg on day +3, cyclosporine A (CsA) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) initiating on day +4. CsA was prescribed at 2 mg/kg as a continuous infusion. The CsA doses were modified to obtain nadir serum levels between 200 and 300 ng/ml. MMF was administered at 15 mg/kg oral three times per day (maximum dose 3 g per day) until day +34 and was then stopped if no aGvHD. Mycophenolate Sodium Enteric-coated Tablets (MPA) can be used instead of MMF; one tablet MPA corresponds to one tablet MMF. CsA was tapered from day +90 to day +180.</p>
