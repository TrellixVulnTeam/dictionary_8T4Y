<p id="Par8">Family members selected as donors were typed on the HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1 and -DQB1 locus at high-resolution level. Haplotype was defined as recipient-donor number of HLA mismatches &gt; 3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Unrelated cord blood (UCB) was co-infused with PBSC graft as the third-party cells at 4 h before the stem cell graft infusion. UCB was preferentially selected based on HLA 4-5/6 matched to total cell number. The PBSC grafts for all patients were mobilized with G-CSF. The target value for CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells in mobilized PBSC graft is a minimum of 10×10
 <sup>6</sup>/kg of recipient weight.
