<p id="Par14">Quantitative chimerism monitoring [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] was performed by short-tandem repeat (STR)-based PCR techniques on CD3-positive cell population from bone marrow and by fluorescent in situ hybridization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] for patients with sex-mismatched donors at regular intervals of every 4 weeks after transplant within first 6 months. The chimerism of cord blood was also monitored after transplantation with STR-based PCR techniques until continuous twice results without cord blood components. Mixed T-cell chimerism was defined as between 5 and 94% recipient cells and complete donor chimerism was defined as the presence of more than 95% donor cells at all measured time points [
