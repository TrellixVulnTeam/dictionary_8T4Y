<p id="Par5">A novel regimen, which is composed of a low dose of ATG (5 mg/kg) and low-dose PTCy (one dose of PTCy, 50 mg/kg) for GvHD prophylaxis in Haploidentical peripheral blood stem cell transplantation combined with unrelated cord blood (Haplo-PBSCT-Cord) for patients with hematologic malignancies, was designed to decrease the risk of aGvHD and lower the incidence of virus reactivation. A prospective, phase II clinical trial (Clinicaltrials.org NCT03395860) was performed to evaluate the efficacy with low-dose ATG followed by low-dose PTCy as GvHD prophylaxis. The results suggested that the novel regimen had excellent outcomes for aGvHD prophylaxis in Haplo-PBSCT-Cord.</p>
