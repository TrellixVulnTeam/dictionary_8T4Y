<p id="Par3">The regimens for prophylaxis of GvHD based on rabbit anti-human thymocyte immunoglobin (ATG 10 mg/kg, Thymoglobin®, Genzyme Polyclonals S.A.S) effectively prevented the occurrence of grade II-IV aGvHD with incidences of 33.4−46%, grade III-IV aGvHD 12−14.9%, but the reactivation incidences of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and EB virus (EBV) were higher due to a slower immune reconstitution [
