<p id="Par27">In conclusion, this is a pilot study to establish a low-dose ATG with low-dose PTCy as an effective regimen to prevent GvHD in Haplo-PBSCT with a lower risk of virus reactivation and a higher engraftment rate. But this study still had several limitations, including a lower number of samples, a shorter follow-up, the combination of haplo PBSCs with UCB, etc. A prospective randomized trial without UCB co-infused is required to compare the efficacies of this regimen with ATG-based or PTCy-based regiments in Haplo-PBSCT.</p>
