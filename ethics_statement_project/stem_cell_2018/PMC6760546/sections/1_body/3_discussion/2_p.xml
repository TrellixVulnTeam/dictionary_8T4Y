<p id="Par23">The engraftment rate was analyzed as the second clinical endpoint. All patients but one were successfully engrafted after transplantation. Thirty-one patients achieved full donor chimerisms between days 14 and 28 after transplantation. But one patient experienced secondary graft failure after CMV pneumonia on +90 days. The engraftment rate in our study was acceptable. In an earlier study about PTCy regimen for GvHD prophylaxis with NMAC regimen, the engraftment failure rate was 13% and it was improved by adding total dose of Cy 29 mg/kg on days –6 and −5 pre-transfusion, which suggested that increasing immunosuppressive intensity facilitated engraftment. Wang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] reported a randomized clinical trial comparing two different doses of ATG (6 and 10 mg/kg) as GvHD prophylaxis for Haplo-HSCT. There was no difference in the median myeloid and platelet engraftment time and the rate of graft failure. We speculated that the addition of low dose of ATG (5 mg/kg) at pretransfusion would ensure the engraftment. High dose of CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells in PBSC graft might be one reason to improve the engraftment rate in our study. In our study, 29/32 cases received MAC regimens, which was another reason for a higher engraftment rate. Solomon et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] reported that 100% of engraftment rate was achieved when MAC was given to patients of Haplo-HSCT with PTCy regimen for GvHD prophylaxis.
