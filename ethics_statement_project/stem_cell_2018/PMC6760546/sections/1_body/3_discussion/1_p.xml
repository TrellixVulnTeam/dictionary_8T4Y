<p id="Par22">Data from our prospective study showed that the CIs of grades II-IV aGvHD and grades III-IV aGvHD within days 100 posttransplantation were 19.4% (95% CI, 5.5–33.3%) and 6.9% (95% CI 0–16.3%) in Haplo-PBSCT-Cord with low-dose ATG plus low-dose PTCy regimen for GvHD prophylaxis respectively, which were much lower than the results using PTCy regimen or ATG-based regimens [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The incidence of cGvHD was 18.8% (95% CI, 3.9−33.7%). No patient died due to aGvHD. The results suggested that low-dose ATG plus low-dose PTCy could effectively prevent aGvHD in patients who undergo Haplo-PBSCT-Cord as good as standard PTCy regimen for Haplo-BMT. PBSC graft was the independent risk factor of aGvHD in Haplo-HSCT with PTCy regimen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. We speculated that more T lymphocytes and different T-cell dynamics in PBSC graft post-transfusion as compared with BM graft might be the major factor for unsatisfied prevention of aGvHD with standard PTCy regimen for Haplo-PBSCT. T lymphocytes in G-CSF-primed PBSC graft might enter into cell cycle at an earlier time than that in BM graft after infusion, so that the first dose of Cy on day +3 in standard PTCy regimen might be late for early active T lymphocytes, because Cy could induce immune tolerance only when it was given precisely between 48 and 72 h, not 24 or 96 h after transplantation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. But it needs to be further studied. Pre-transfusion low-dose ATG could deplete early active T lymphocytes to prevent the occurrence of aGvHD in combination with PTCy on day +3 with synergistic effects due to their different mechanisms of ATG and Cy on T lymphocytes.
