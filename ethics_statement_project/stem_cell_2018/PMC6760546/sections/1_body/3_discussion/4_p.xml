<p id="Par25">Disease relapse remains a significant cause of treatment failure after allogeneic HSCT, especially for patients with active disease. In the present study, six cases relapsed and three of them died. All the six patients were in active disease. One patient was primary refractory with DNMT3-A mutation. The other five patients had no response to salvage chemotherapy. In previous reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], PTCy-based regimens did not impact the relapse of hematologic malignancies after Haplo-HSCT as compared with HLA-matched transplantation and with different preconditioning intensity. In a recent report [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] grade II aGvHD could reduce relapse risk and improve the survival of patients with hematological malignancies with PTCy regimen for prophylaxis of GvHD in Haplo-BMT. In the study, all patients received NMAC regimens and all of the grafts were from bone marrow. But in our study, nearly all patients received MAC regimens and all of the grafts were from PBSC. These differences might lessen the effect of mild aGvHD on disease recurrence. The lower NRM (9.4%) in this study needs to be carefully interpreted, because of younger age, shorter follow-up and lower HCT score (0âˆ’1) of patients. The impact of our novel regimen of GvHD prophylaxis on relapse and NRM with longer follow-up and more samples needs to be further evaluated.
