  <p>Computational analysis of organ scores reveals phenotypic clusters of patients with chronic graft-
   <italic>versus</italic>-host disease who were stratified for overall survival. (A) Patients were grouped into seven clusters by the machine-learning workflow (
   <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S1</italic>) and described using marker enrichment modeling (MEM) labels (left), which captured features enriched (▲) or specifically lacking (▼) from each group relative to the others in the cohort. Risk coefficients (right) were then calculated for each group. Risk scores below −0.25 or above 0.25 were considered low and high risk, respectively, and 0 was the average risk for the cohort. Clusters 1-3 were lower risk, Cluster 4 was intermediate risk, and Clusters 5-7 were higher risk. (B) Overall survival probability was stratified for the patients with chronic graft-
   <italic>versus</italic>-host disease based on the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk clusters defined by the computational analysis.
