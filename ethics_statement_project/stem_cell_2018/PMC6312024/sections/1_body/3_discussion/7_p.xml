<p>Patients in Cluster 7 derived from the decision tree, a liver predominant-severe phenotype, also had a different disease trajectory when compared to patients in other clusters in that they had a significantly worse overall survival than patients in all other clusters combined. This decision-tree-derived cluster is supported by previous research showing that severe elevation of liver enzymes is a known risk factor for adverse outcomes in chronic GvHD.
