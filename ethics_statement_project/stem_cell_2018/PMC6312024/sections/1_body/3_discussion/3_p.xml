<p>Clusters of patients identified by the computational workflow were associated with different clinical risk, demonstrated by differences in overall survival. Clusters of patients in the high-risk group were enriched for skin and liver involvement. A skin score of 3 and liver score of 3 have previously been shown to be associated with non-relapse mortality in an analysis that included patients in this cohort.
