<p>Cluster 6, a mixed phenotype, high-risk cluster, was a novel high-risk cluster revealed by the decision tree. This cluster was defined by enrichment for mouth, eye, and gastrointestinal tract involvement. Notably, this cluster required the highest number of questions on the decision tree to reach, indicating that it was poorly defined and required that other clusters were ruled out to find patients in this phenotypic group. Patients in this cluster had significantly worse overall survival when compared to all those in all other clusters combined. A caveat is that, in stability analysis of the machine-learning workflow, Cluster 6 was not highly stable, but it did recur through all repetitions of analysis (

The combination of these areas of organ involvement has not been previously cited as a risk factor for adverse outcomes in chronic GvHD and should be further explored through cellular analyses for biomarkers and evaluated in continued validation cohorts.
