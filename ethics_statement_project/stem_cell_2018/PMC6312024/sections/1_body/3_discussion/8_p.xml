<p>Prognostication by clustering is distinct from prognostication by individual organ scores alone. For example, in the machine-learning analysis, Cluster 5 lacked liver involvement and was a high-risk cluster, while high-risk Cluster 6 and Cluster 7 were specifically enriched for liver involvement. This supports the concept that this single organ score does not confer unidirectional low or high risk within the clusters. Furthermore, Liver
 <sup>+5</sup> enrichment was seen in multiple low-risk clusters and one high-risk cluster. Clustering is unique in that it is not an individual organ score or characteristic but rather combinations of organ involvement and the specific absence of organ involvement that drive cluster formation and likely prognosis. Another example of this is that mouth enrichment was seen in both an intermediate-risk cluster (Cluster 4) and high-risk cluster (Cluster 6). Cluster 6, a high-risk cluster, comprises mouth, eye and liver enrichment; these individual enrichment types appear in low-risk clusters but it is perhaps the combination that makes this a high-risk cluster. However, we cannot rule out that gastrointestinal tract enrichment, uniquely present in Cluster 6, is not the driving force of adverse outcomes.
