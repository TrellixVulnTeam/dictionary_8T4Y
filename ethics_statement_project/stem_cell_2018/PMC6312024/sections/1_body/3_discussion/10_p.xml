<p>These results have the potential to be applied to stratify risk in the clinical setting, enhance the current chronic GvHD classification system, refine inclusion criteria for phase 2 trials, and guide biomarker discovery for more specific therapeutic targets. The distillation of machine-learning knowledge into a decision tree increases the feasibility of clinical application of the clusters. However, the clusters have not been externally validated, and this step should be explored before clinical application.</p>
