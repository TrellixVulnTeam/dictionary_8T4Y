<p>Lastly, this a flexible machine learning-inspired work- flow with numerous potential applications. The stability of the clusters suggests that this approach will be highly useful in revealing groups not only for this disease but for others that have complex phenotypes. Although the endpoint for this analysis was overall survival, this workflow could be applied to explore whether clusters of patients differ in treatment response or composite chronic GvHD endpoints, such as failure-free survival. Additionally, this workflow has the potential to be applied to other human diseases with complex classification systems such as myelodysplastic syndrome and brain tumors. This approach may change the classification of human disease by revealing otherwise unapparent, clinically relevant patterns.</p>
