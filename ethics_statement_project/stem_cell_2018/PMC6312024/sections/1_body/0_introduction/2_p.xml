<p>To date, it has not been straightforward to align the National Institutes of Health (NIH) overall severity classification system and biomarkers.

 </sup> There have been some associations between the severity of chronic GvHD, as determined by the NIH classification system (NIH-Severity) and biomarkers, but biomarkers have not been able to predict clinical outcomes as strongly in chronic GvHD as in acute GvHD.

 </sup> Previous analyses examined disease severity in individual organs and overall disease severity but have not combined organs for phenotypic clinical subgrouping.

 </sup> A phenotypic approach to classification has the potential to characterize the pathogenesis of chronic GvHD better. Furthermore, a computational workflow capable of analyzing patterns of chronic GvHD may also have the power to elucidate patterns in other diseases in oncology and throughout clinical medicine.
