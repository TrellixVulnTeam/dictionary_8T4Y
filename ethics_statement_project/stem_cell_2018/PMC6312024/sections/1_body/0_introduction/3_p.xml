 </sup> Machine learning has the potential to find patterns in clinical data that may be missed by the human observer and traditional approaches alone.

 </sup> A potential advantage of machine learning approaches compared to traditional statistical approaches is that results can go beyond a preformed hypothesis allowing for discovery of novel associations and clusters.

 </sup> Additionally, with high-dimensional data, such as the types and grades of organ involvement in chronic GvHD, the multiple comparisons required in conventional statistics can lead to false-positives, whereas a machine learning-inspired approach allows for processing of multidimensional data.
