 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1040189">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S1</italic>). viSNE is the visualization of an algorithm called t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). Therefore, on all viSNE maps the axes are called t-SNE1 and t-SNE2.

 <italic>Online Supplementary Methods</italic>. NIH scores were squared prior to viSNE analysis and all scores were scaled from 0-1. FlowSOM clustering was done using t-SNE axes. Skin erythema and sclerosis were analyzed as separate skin features in order to capture type of skin involvement by chronic GvHD.
