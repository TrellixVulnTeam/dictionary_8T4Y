<p>Decision-tree-determined risk groups stratified survival. Patients in decision-tree-derived Clusters 1 (ocular predominant phenotype), 2 (sclerotic phenotype) and 3 (liver predominant-moderate phenotype) were classified as low risk based on Cox proportional hazards risk coefficients (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-1040189">Figure 4</xref>). Patients in decision-tree-derived Clusters 4 (mixed-phenotype intermediate risk) and 5 (erythema predominant phenotype) were classified as intermediate risk, while patients in Clusters 6 (mixed phenotype-high risk phenotype) and 7 (liver predominant-severe phenotype) were classified as high risk. Patients in the high- and intermediate-risk groups had significantly shorter overall survival than those in the low-risk group (HR=2.79; 95% CI: 1.58-4.91;
