<p>In a cluster stability analysis involving four additional runs of viSNE and FlowSOM using the same organ features, five of the seven clusters were highly stable (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S5</italic>). Stability was defined as having a median f-measure â‰¥0.85. Stable clusters had phenotypically similar MEM labels between replications of analysis as well. Clusters 2-5 and 7 were highly stable. Clusters 1 and 6 were unstable with low reproducibility between replications of analysis.
