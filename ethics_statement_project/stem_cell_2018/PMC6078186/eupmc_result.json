Patients and methods:A randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover, single-dose Phase I study was conducted for 56 healthy subjects. After a 5 and 10 \u03bcg/kg single subcutaneous administration of test and reference product, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters (absolute neutrophil count and CD34+ cell count) were compared. During the study, safety tests and adverse event monitoring were performed. Results:The test and the reference products had a comparable pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety profile. In both 5 and 10 \u03bcg/kg dosing, the 90% CIs of the test to reference ratio for primary parameters (peak plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration vs time curve from time 0 extrapolated to the infinite time for plasma filgrastim concentration; maximal effect and area under the time-effect curve from time 0 to time of the last quantifiable effect for absolute neutrophil count) were within the 0.8-1.25 range.
