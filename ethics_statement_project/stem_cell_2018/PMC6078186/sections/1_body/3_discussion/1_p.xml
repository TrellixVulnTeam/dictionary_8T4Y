<p>The purpose of this study was to compare PK, PD, and safety between a biosimilar filgrastim product and the reference product following a single subcutaneous injection. According to the FDA biosimilar guidance, the dose selected should be one most likely to provide clinically meaningful and interpretable data.
 <xref rid="b11-dddt-12-2381" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Because the development plan aimed to use the test product for the indications of the reference product at doses of 5 and 10 μg/kg, this study was conducted with the 2 dosing parts (5 and 10 μg/kg). The sampling schedule were set based on PK data of the reference product

 <xref rid="b18-dddt-12-2381" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and the in-house test product data. The sampling intervals were appropriately set to observe the profiles of PK and PD, and the last time points were set sufficiently long for all measurements to return to the baselines.
