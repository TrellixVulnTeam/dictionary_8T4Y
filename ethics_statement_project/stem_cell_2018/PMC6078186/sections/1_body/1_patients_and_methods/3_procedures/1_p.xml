<p>After providing written informed consent, the subjects attended an initial screening visit to undergo screening procedures between 2 and 28 days prior to the first dosing. On Day −1, eligible subjects were admitted to the clinical trials center at Severance Hospital and randomized. After an overnight fast, subjects were administered a single dose of filgrastim on the early morning of Day 1. Either the test or reference drug was administered by the pre-assigned sequence. Blood was drawn for PK and PD evaluation at prespecified time points. On Day 3, the subjects had 48-hour PK/PD samples drawn, underwent a repeated safety assessment, and were discharged from the site. PD sampling after discharge was performed via subsequent visits according to a predetermined time schedule. After a 28-day washout period, period 2 was conducted in a crossover manner. On Day 14±2 of period 2, subjects underwent a follow-up visit for final safety assessments. During the hospital stay and at follow-up, adverse event (AE) monitoring, concomitant medication recording, laboratory analyses (hematology, blood chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis), physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature), and 12-lead ECG were also performed. To examine drug immunogenicity, anti-filgrastim antibodies test was performed at each admission and follow-up.</p>
