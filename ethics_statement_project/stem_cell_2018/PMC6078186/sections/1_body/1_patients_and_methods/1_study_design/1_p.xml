 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT02725086). This was a randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover, single-dose study with a washout period of 28 days. There were 2 dosing parts (5 and 10 μg/kg) in this study, with 2 sequences in them. In each sequence, 14 healthy subjects were assigned to either the test drug or the reference drug in a crossover manner. All the subjects received information on the details of the study and gave written informed consent. According to sequence and period, subjects received either a subcutaneous injection of the test product or the reference product. The overall study scheme is shown in

 <sub>max</sub>] and area under the time-concentration curve from time 0 to infinity [AUC
 <sub>inf</sub>]) and PD parameters (maximal effect [
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>max</sub>] and area under the time-effect curve from time 0 to 120 h [AUEC
 <sub>0–120 h</sub>] of absolute neutrophil count [ANC]) between the test product and the reference product.
