<p>Healthy male subjects aged 19–45 years volunteered for this study. Body mass index of the subjects had to be 18.5 kg/m
 <sup>2</sup> or greater but &lt;25.0 kg/m
 <sup>2</sup>, with a minimum weight of 60 kg. Subjects with histories of receiving recombinant G-CSF were excluded, and the ANC had to be between 2×10
 <sup>3</sup>/μL and 7×10
 <sup>3</sup>/μL. In the screening process, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature), laboratory analyses (hematology, blood chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), urine drug screening, and serology testing were performed. Fifty-six eligible subjects participated in the study. They had no clinically significant screening results and had no relevant medical or medication histories.
