<p>For analysis of ANC and CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell count, 3 mL of blood was collected into EDTA tubes. ANC sampling was performed at pre-dose (0 hours), and 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours post-dose; and CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell count sampling was performed at pre-dose (0 hours), and 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168, 240, and 312 hours post-dose. PD samples were stored at ambient temperature prior to analysis. The ANC was measured using XN-series (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell count was measured using a flow cytometer (BD™ FACSVerse™; BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA) and enumeration kits for CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell (BD Stem Cell Enumeration Kit and BD Stem Cell Control Kit; BD Bioscience).
