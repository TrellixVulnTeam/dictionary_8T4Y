<p>For PK sampling, 8 mL blood sample was collected into an EDTA Vacutainer
 <sup>®</sup> based on the PK sampling schedule: at pre-dose (0 hours), and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 48 hours post-dose. Within 60 minutes of blood draw, the blood sample was centrifuged (1,800 
 <italic>g</italic>, 4°C, 8 minutes to separate the plasma) and stored at −70°C or below until analysis. Plasma filgrastim concentrations were measured using a solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Quantikine
 <sup>®</sup> Human G-CSF Immunoassay; R&amp;D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). The range of calibration curve was set at 0–625 pg/mL and the lower limit of quantification was 5.05 pg/mL. The curves were determined to be linear with all coefficient values over 0.99. The accuracy was within 80%–120% and all quality control samples were within the pre-defined quality control range.
