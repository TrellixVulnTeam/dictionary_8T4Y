<p>Neupogen
 <sup>Â®</sup> is the first commercial pharmaceutical analog of G-CSF from Amgen Inc. (Thousand Oaks, CA, USA), which was manufactured using recombinant 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> bacteria with human G-CSF gene. It has similarities to endogenous G-CSF in terms of structure (except for the addition of an N-terminal methionine), efficacy, and safety profile. It has been a great success since its first approval in 1998 and is still among the top 15 bestselling drugs of 2016.
