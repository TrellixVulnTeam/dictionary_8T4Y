This first-in-human study characterized the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of U3-1565 in subjects with advanced solid tumors. In Part 1 (dose escalation following a modified 3\u2009+\u20093 design), Cohorts 1-4, U3-1565 was administered at 2, 8, 16, and 24\u00a0mg/kg every 3\u00a0weeks for Cycle 1 and every 2\u00a0weeks thereafter. In Part 1, Cohort 5, and in Part 2 (dose expansion), U3-1565 was administered at 24\u00a0mg/kg every week. Thirty-six subjects were enrolled and treated (15 in Part 1; 21 in Part 2). No subject experienced dose limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose was not reached. All drug-related events were Grade 1 or 2 in severity, with fatigue and rash predominating.

Of the remaining subjects, only 19/30 showed a decrease (median\u2009-\u200918% [-2% to -82%]).
