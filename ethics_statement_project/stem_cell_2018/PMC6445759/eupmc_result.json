common treatment-related complication after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Lymphocyte migration plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of GVHD. A previous phase I/II trial demonstrated that CCR5 blockade with maraviroc in the first 30days after allo-HCT resulted in a low incidence of early acute GVHD, primarily in visceral organs, but with no impact on late acute or chronic GVHD. We conducted a phase II trial to examine the efficacy of an extended course of maraviroc, administered through post-transplantation day +90 in addition to standard prophylaxis in 37 recipients of reduced-intensity-conditioned unrelated donor allo-HCT performed to treat hematologic malignancies. Extended maraviroc treatment was safe and feasible. The primary study endpoint, day +180 rate of grade II-IV acute GVHD, was 22 \u00b1 7%, liver GVHD was not observed, and gut GVHD was uncommon. The day +180 rate of grade III-IV acute GVHD was 5 \u00b1 4%. The 1-year rate of moderate to severe chronic GVHD was 8 \u00b1 5% and that of disease relapse was 30 \u00b1 8%. Overall survival at 1 year was 70 \u00b1 8%. Compared with the previously studied short course of maraviroc, the extended course resulted in a significantly higher GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], .45; 95% confidence interval [CI], .25 to .82; P\u202f=\u202f.009) and overall survival (adjusted HR, .48; 95% CI, .24 to .96; P\u202f=\u202f.037). A combined analysis of both trials showed that high maraviroc trough concentrations on the day of hematopoietic cell infusion were associated with lower rates of acute GVHD. An extended course of maraviroc after reduced-intensity-conditioned unrelated donor allo-HCT is safe and effective in preventing acute and chronic GVHD and is associated with favorable survival.", "affiliation": "Abramson Cancer Center and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Division of Hematology/Oncology and Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.
