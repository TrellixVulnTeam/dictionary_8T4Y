\u22652 keratoconjunctivitis sicca, sclerotic features or esophageal stricture) for three categories of alternative donor: cord blood, haplorelated marrow or peripheral blood with post-transplant cyclophosphamide, and unrelated single HLA-allele mismatched peripheral blood. Among 396 consecutive hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, 129 developed chronic graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease with 3-year cumulative incidences of 8% for cord blood, 24% for haplorelated grafts, and 55% for unrelated single HLA-allele mismatched peripheral blood. Disability rates were significantly lower for cord blood [hazard ratio (HR) 0.13; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.1-0.4] and for the haplorelated group (HR 0.31; 95% CI: 0.1-0.7) compared to the rate in the group transplanted with unrelated single HLA-allele mismatched peripheral blood. Cord blood recipients were also >2-fold more likely to return to work/school within 3 years from the onset of chronic graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease (HR 2.54; 95% CI: 1.1-5.7, <i>P</i>=0.02), and the haplorelated group trended similarly (HR 2.38; 95% CI: 1.0-5.9, <i>P</i>=0.06). Cord blood recipients were more likely to discontinue immunosuppression than were recipients of unrelated single HLA-allele mismatched peripheral blood (HR 3.96; 95% CI: 1.9-8.4, <i>P</i>=0.0003), similarly to the haplorelated group (HR 4.93; 95% CI: 2.2-11.1, <i>P</i>=0.0001). Progression-free survival and non-relapse mortality did not differ between groups grafted from different types of donors. Our observations that, compared to recipients of unrelated single HLA-allele mismatched peripheral blood, recipients of cord blood and haplorelated grafts less often developed disability related to chronic graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease, and were more likely to resume work/school, should help better counseling of pre-hematopoietic cell transplant candidates.", "affiliation": "Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Seattle, WA, USA.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Clinical Trial", "research-article", "Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "P30 CA015704", "agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "acronym": "CA", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "R01 CA118953", "agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "acronym": "CA", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "U01 CA118953", "agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "acronym": "CA", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "P01 CA018029", "agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "acronym": "CA", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "P01 HL122173", "agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "acronym": "HL", "orderIn": "0"}]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Graft vs Host Disease", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "IM", "qualifierName": "immunology", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "MO", "qualifierName": "mortality", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "HLA Antigens", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "IM", "qualifierName": "immunology", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Histocompatibility Testing"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Disease-Free Survival"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Survival Rate"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Adult"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Aged"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Female"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Male"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Unrelated Donors"}]}, "chemicalList": {"chemical": {"name": "HLA Antigens", "registryNumber": "0"}}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3324/haematol.2018.202754"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6442956"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6442956?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "4", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by-nc", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2020-05-06", "dateOfCreation": "2018-11-17", "firstIndexDate": "2018-11-17", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-12", "dateOfRevision": "2020-05-06", "electronicPublicationDate": "2018-11-15", "firstPublicationDate": "2018-11-15"}, "htmllinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6442956", "abstract": "We determined the incidence of disability related to chronic graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease (bronchiolitis obliterans, grade \u22652 keratoconjunctivitis sicca, sclerotic features or esophageal stricture) for three categories of alternative donor: cord blood, haplorelated marrow or peripheral blood with post-transplant cyclophosphamide, and unrelated single HLA-allele mismatched peripheral blood.
