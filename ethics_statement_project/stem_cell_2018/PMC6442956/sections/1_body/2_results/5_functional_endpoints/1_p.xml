<p>A higher proportion of UCB patients than 1-mMUD HCT recipients (68% 
 <italic>versus</italic> 35%) returned to work or school within 3 years after the onset of chronic GvHD [HR 2.54 (95% CI: 1.1-5.7), 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.02], and a similar trend was observed in the Haplo/PTCY group [62% 
 <italic>versus</italic> 35%, HR 2.38 (95% CI: 1.0-5.9), 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.06] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-1040835">Figure 4C</xref>). Eighteen patients had returned to work or school before the onset of chronic GvHD (14 in the 1-mMUD and 4 in the Haplo/PTCY HCT groups). We also found trends suggesting improved annualized Karnovsky Performance Status change from the onset of chronic GvHD to 3.5 years afterwards in the UCB [+5 (range, −12 to +44)] and Haplo/PTCY [+11 (range, −14 to +64)] groups compared to the 1-mMUD group [0 (range, −81 to +46)] (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.05 and 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.06, respectively). We found no difference in avascular necrosis at 3 years among the three alternative donor groups (12% in the 1-mMUD, 12% in the UCB, and 5% in the Haplo/PTCY HCT recipients).
