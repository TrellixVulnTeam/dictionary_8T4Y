<p>We identified 396 alternative donor HCT recipients who received a first allogeneic transplant for any disease between 2006 and 2015 at our center. The median age at HCT was 42 years (range, 18-73) for UCB, 48 years (range, 18-75) for Haplo/PTCY, and 55 years (range, 22-77) for 1-mMUD HCT recipients. Acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome were the most common diagnoses at HCT, 64% and 65% among the UCB and 1-mMUD HCT recipients, respectively, while lymphomas were the most common diagnosis (52%) among the Haplo/PTCY HCT recipients. Other demographic characteristics are summarized in
