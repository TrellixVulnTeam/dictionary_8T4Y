<p>The cumulative incidence of any manifestation of high morbidity at 3 years after the diagnosis of chronic GvHD is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-1040835">Figure 3A</xref> and was significantly lower in the UCB (17%) and Haplo/PTCY (23%) groups than in the 1-mMUD group (58%) [HR 0.16 (95% CI: 0.1-0.4);

 <xref rid="t3-1040835" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the distribution of chronic GvHD manifestations of high morbidity according to the three HCT donor groups. The most frequent high morbidity was keratoconjunctivitis sicca followed by sclerosis and bronchiolitis obliterans (lungs). Moderate or severe joint/fasciae involvement and esophageal stricture requiring dilation were less frequent high morbidity manifestations. The cumulative incidence of keratoconjunctivitis sicca was significantly lower in the UCB group than in the 1-mMUD group (10% 
 <italic>versus</italic> 39%, 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.003) and was also lower in the Haplo/PTCY group (10%, 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.05). The 3-year cumulative incidence of any high morbidity and the three most frequent high morbidity chronic GvHD manifestations according to the alternative donor groups are displayed in
