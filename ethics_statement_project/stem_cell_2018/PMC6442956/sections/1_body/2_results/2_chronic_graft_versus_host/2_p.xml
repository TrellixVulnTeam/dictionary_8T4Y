<p>Sites of chronic GvHD and the presence of eosinophilia at any time during the course of chronic GvHD among the three alternative donor HCT groups are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-1040835">Figure 2</xref>. Mouth and skin were the most common sites of chronic GvHD in the three groups (&gt;80%). Eyes were affected by chronic GvHD of any degree at any time in 75% of the 1-mMUD, 52% of the Haplo/PTCY, and 34% of the UCB HCT recipients. The same pattern was identified for hepatic involvement at any time (56% of 1-mmUD, 43% of Haplo/PTCY, and 24% of UCB HCT recipients). On the other hand, gastrointestinal tract involvement at any time developed in 72% of the UCB patients, but in 58% of the 1-mmUD and 52% of the Haplo/PTCY HCT recipients.
