<p>Of the 396 alternative donor HCT recipients, 129 developed chronic GvHD that required systemic treatment and were included in this study. The cases of treatment-requiring chronic GvHD were diagnosed in 29 of the 163 UCB HCT recipients, 21 of 88 Haplo/PTCY HCT recipients and 79 of 145 1-mMUD HCT recipients, for 3-year cumulative incidences of 18%, 24% and 55%, respectively. The rate of chronic GvHD was significantly lower in UCB and Haplo/PTCY recipients than in 1-mMURD recipients [hazard ratio (HR)=0.23; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.2-0.4), 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001, and HR=0.29 (95% CI: 0.2-0.5), 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001, respectively] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1040835">Figure 1A</xref>). The incidence of chronic GvHD was comparable between patients who received 1-mMUD grafts with either allelic or antigenic mismatches (
 <italic>data not shown</italic>). Progression-free survival after HCT did not differ among the three donor groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1040835">Figure 1B</xref>). The median follow-up times after the onset of chronic GvHD were 48 (range, 4–121) months for UCB, 60 (range, &lt;1–123) for Haplo/PTCY, and 46 (range, 4–131) for 1-mMUD HCT. The median time from HCT to diagnosis of chronic GvHD was shorter in the UCB recipients than in 1-mMUD HCT recipients [3.9 (range, 2.6-18.2) 
 <italic>versus</italic> 7.8 (range, 2.7-38.2) months, 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.001]. As shown in 
 <xref rid="t2-1040835" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the incidence frequencies of overlap chronic GvHD (&gt;80%) and of prior acute GvHD (&gt;70%) were high in all three groups. These findings are consistent with the frequent diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal GvHD at our center.

 </sup> The severity of chronic GvHD at diagnosis was significantly lower in the UCB group than in the 1-mMUD group (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.008) (
 <xref rid="t2-1040835" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), but the severity of GvHD manifestations at the onset of chronic GvHD did not differ between the Haplo/PTCY and the 1-mMUD groups (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.74) (
 <xref rid="t2-1040835" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). According to the National Institutes of Health Global Severity scale, the incidence of moderate or severe chronic GvHD at diagnosis was 62% in the UCB group, 76% in the Haplo/PTCY group and 83% in the 1-mMUD group.
