<p>Keratoconjunctivitis sicca was the most common chronic GvHD manifestation of high morbidity. Of note, the incidence of severe keratoconjunctivitis sicca at any time after the diagnosis of chronic GvHD was at least 4-fold higher in the 1-mMUD group than in the UCB group and at least 2-fold higher in the 1-mMUD group than in the Haplo/PTCY group. Prospective trials have shown that quality of life is impaired in patients with chronic GvHD involving the eyes.
