<p>In conclusion, our results show that compared to 1-mMUD recipients, UCB and Haplo/PTCY HCT recipients were less likely to develop chronic GvHD, were less likely to develop disability related to chronic GvHD, had a shorter duration of systemic treatment for chronic GvHD and returned to work or school earlier. While our data do not imply superiority of one alternative transplant strategy 
 <italic>versus</italic> another (e.g. Haplo/PTCY 
 <italic>versus</italic> 1-mMUD peripheral blood 
 <italic>versus</italic> UCB), the current study provides detailed information regarding disability related to chronic GvHD when it occurs after alternative donor HCT. These findings should help transplant providers to counsel pre-HCT candidates better. Determination of disability associated with chronic GvHD is necessary in prospective studies testing alternative donor graft products such as Haplo/PTCY 
 <italic>versus</italic> UCB to evaluate the overall efficacy of these strategies.
