<p>The main endpoints of this study were chronic GvHD manifestations associated with disability and impaired functional outcomes (i.e., return to work/school after the diagnosis of chronic GvHD, discontinuation of systemic immunosuppressive therapy, and change in Karnovsky Performance Status). We also compared the overall severity of chronic GvHD at initial diagnosis and the incidences of avascular necrosis, new systemic immunosuppression or treatment after first-line therapy for chronic GvHD, non-relapse mortality and overall survival after chronic GvHD diagnosis.</p>
