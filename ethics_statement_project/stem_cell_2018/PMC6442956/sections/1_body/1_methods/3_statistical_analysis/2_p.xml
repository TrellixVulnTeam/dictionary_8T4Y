<p>The chronic GvHD characteristics between donor groups were compared using a Ï‡
 <sup>2</sup> test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables. Overall survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Cumulative incidences of chronic GvHD and of events after the onset of chronic GvHD were estimated by methods for competing risks, as previously described.

 </sup> Death was a competing event for all risks except non-relapse mortality; relapse was a competing event for non-relapse mortality. All comparisons of time-to-event endpoints were performed using Cox regression. The analysis of return to work or school was restricted to patients who were working or in school before HCT, and had not returned to work or school before the onset of chronic GvHD. The analysis of high morbidity was based on the first defining complication. All 
 <italic>P</italic>-values are two-sided and unadjusted for multiple comparisons.
