<p>In this trial there was no benefit of the addition of everolimus to post-induction chemotherapy, despite the pre-clinical 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> rationale for the use of this mTOR inhibitor. The main explanations appear to be the observed excess toxicity, which was primarily gastrointestinal (mucositis and diarrhea), and biochemical evidence of liver toxicity at the dose chosen. Infection was a major issue in the first 6 months of treatment with 12 
 <italic>versus</italic> 1 deaths attributed to infection in the everolimus and control arms, respectively. This did not appear to be the result of prolonged neutropenia but may be attributable to the immunosuppressive effects of everolimus when given with chemotherapy, which reflects what has been seen with the use of the mTOR inhibitor in solid tumors.

 </sup> This in turn contributed to sub-optimal drug delivery for many patients. The chosen schedule of 10 mg daily was not feasible in this setting, but drug delivery improved when a 5 mg daily dose was introduced. Other studies in leukemia have used equivalent schedules
