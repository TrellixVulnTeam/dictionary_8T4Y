<p>The majority (70-85%) of younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) will enter complete morphological remission with any one of a variety of induction treatments. However, nearly half will relapse. It is being increasingly recognized that a substantial proportion of those subjects in morphological remission do actually have residual disease, as determined by techniques of minimal/measurable residual disease assessment (flow cytometry or quantitative polymerase chain reaction

 </sup>). In our previous studies we endeavored to define the optimum post-remission chemotherapy. To date we have concluded that, apart from transplantation, following two induction courses of anthracycline-containing therapy, two consolidation courses of cytarabine (Ara-C) is adequate.

 </sup> One of the aims of the UK NCRI AML17 trial was to explore the effects of a further reduction in the total number of chemotherapy courses from four to three, as well as the addition of molecularly targeted treatments to consolidation therapy. Among these was the incorporation of the inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), everolimus.
