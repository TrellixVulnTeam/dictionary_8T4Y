<p>The randomization opened in October 2009. In 2012, the independent data monitoring committee recommended closure of the randomization because of an excess of early mortality in remission with everolimus and no associated evidence of relapse reduction. Between October 2009 and October 2012, 332 of 482 eligible patients were randomized (

 <xref rid="t1-1031654" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. There were no significant differences in survival outcomes between eligible patients who entered the randomization and those who did not (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.8), although patients with higher white blood cell counts, worse performance status and secondary disease were marginally less likely to enter the randomization. The median age was 47 years (range, 16-69). The majority presented with 
 <italic>de novo</italic> AML and had a WHO performance score of &lt;2. The other protocol treatments given to patients in the everolimus randomization are shown in 
 <xref rid="t1-1031654" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In addition to standard daunorubicin/Ara-C induction, etoposide and gemtuzumab ozogamicin was given to 43% and 45% of patients, respectively, in induction with no difference between the arms.
