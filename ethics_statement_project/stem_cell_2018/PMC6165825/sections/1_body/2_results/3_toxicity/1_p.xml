<p>The recorded toxicities are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-1031654">Figure 3</xref>. There were more hematologic toxicities in the everolimus arm and these were most obvious after the first everolimus course, with a median time to platelet count recovery to &gt;100Ã—10
 <sup>9</sup>/L being 9 days longer (39 
 <italic>versus</italic> 29 days; 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.006); this was reflected by a significantly greater requirement for platelet support (
 <xref rid="t3-1031654" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The kinetics of neutrophil recovery was unaffected by everolimus, but there was significantly more use of antibiotics and a longer stay in hospital with the first course of everolimus, as well as increased oral toxicity (course 1) and higher alanine transaminase levels (course 2).
