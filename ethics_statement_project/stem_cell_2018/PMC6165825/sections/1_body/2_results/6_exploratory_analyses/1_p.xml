<p>Correlations with everolimus plasma inhibitory activity, determined by the assay used in this study, did not show convincing patterns. Even patients whose samples showed deep and sustained inhibition did not have an associated reduction in relapse (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S2</italic>). There was no relationship between the level of inhibition and toxicity or excess mortality. Prior induction chemotherapy, age, gender, white blood cell count, and minimal residual disease status after course one all had no impact on outcomes (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S4A</italic>). In addition no relationship was found between other treatment modalities given and response, and no gene mutation, including the 111 genes assayed by Sanger sequencing in 123 patients, was shown to be associated with a differential response (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S5</italic>). Because of concerns about compliance with everolimus treatment, relapse-free survival was compared between patients with satisfactory drug delivery (defined as at least 14 days of treatment per course), those with inadequate drug delivery (less than 14 days treatment per course) and those allocated to no treatment. Although patients in whom drug delivery was inadequate (n=85) had a worse relapse-free survival (29%) there was no difference in relapse-free survival between patients with satisfactory drug delivery (n=63) at 41% and no everolimus treatment (n=99) at 40% (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S4</italic>).
