<p>The overall outcomes are shown in 
 <xref rid="t2-1031654" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The cumulative incidence of relapse at 5 years (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-1031654">Figure 4A</xref>) did not differ significantly between arms [60% 
 <italic>versus</italic> 54%, HR 1.12 (0.82-1.52), 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.5]. There was a significant excess of deaths in remission in the everolimus arm in the first 6 months following randomization [8% 
 <italic>versus</italic> 1%, HR 3.57 (1.36-9.42), 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.009], with no significant differences thereafter, leading to a non-significant excess of overall mortality with everolimus [11% 
 <italic>versus</italic> 6%, HR 1.75 (0.83-3.70), 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.14] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-1031654">Figure 4B</xref>). In the first 6 months there were 17 deaths in remission in the everolimus arm 
 <italic>versus</italic> 1 death in the control arm: the causes of these deaths were infection (9 
 <italic>versus</italic> 1), infection + hemorrhage (3 
 <italic>versus</italic> 0), hemorrhage/cardiovascular accident (3 
 <italic>versus</italic> 0), cardiac (1 
 <italic>versus</italic> 0) and multiple (1 
 <italic>versus</italic> 0). Beyond 6 months, there were six deaths in each of the two arms, with the causes of these deaths in remission being infection (1 
 <italic>versus</italic> 1), cardiac (1 
 <italic>versus</italic> 0), hepatic (1 
 <italic>versus</italic> 0), second cancer (1 
 <italic>versus</italic> 0), graft-
 <italic>versus</italic>-host disease (0 
 <italic>versus</italic> 1), multiple (0 
 <italic>versus</italic> 2) and unknown/other (2 
 <italic>versus</italic> 2).
