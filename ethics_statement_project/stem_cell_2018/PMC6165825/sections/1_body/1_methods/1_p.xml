<p>The UK NCRI AML 17 trial (ISRNCTN 55675535) was a large, prospective, phase 3, multicenter trial for patients with newly-diagnosed AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (&gt;10% marrow blasts), generally under the age of 60 years, open from April 2009 to December 2014 in more than 130 centers in the United Kingdom, Denmark and New Zealand. Through randomization of the participants, it addressed several issues (

Between October 2009 and October 2012, 499 adult patients who did not have acute promyelocytic leukemia had received a first induction course of treatment: those who did not have core-binding factor leukemia, high-risk disease (defined using a multifactorial score

 </sup> Allogeneic stem cell transplantation was permitted for patients with intermediate- or poor-risk disease with a recommendation of myelo-ablative conditioning for patients aged &lt;35 years and reduced intensity conditioning for intermediate-risk patients aged &gt;45 years, with investigators able to choose an ablative or reduced intensity approach for patients between 35 and 45 years.
