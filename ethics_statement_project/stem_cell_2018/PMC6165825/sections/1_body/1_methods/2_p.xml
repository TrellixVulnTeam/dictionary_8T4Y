<p>Of all adult patients entering the AML17 trial while the everolimus randomization was available, 34% were eligible for such randomization. These patients were randomized to receive, or not, oral everolimus (10 mg daily from 2 days after each chemotherapy course for up to 28 days or until 2 days before the start of the subsequent course, whichever was shorter) between each course of consolidation chemotherapy. In patients allocated three courses of treatment, a final 28-day course of everolimus was given after a 1-week break. In patients with side effects thought to be due to everolimus, subsequent daily doses could be reduced by 50%. If this did not improve tolerability, dosing could be further reduced to alternate days; if these reduced doses were not tolerated, subsequent doses were to be omitted. After 65% (n=146) of the patients randomized to everolimus had been assessed, the independent data monitoring committee recommended, because of increased side effects and reduced compliance, that the starting daily dose of everolimus be reduced to 5 mg with the option to increase to 10 mg if well-tolerated.</p>
