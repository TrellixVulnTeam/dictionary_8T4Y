The treatment strategy was evaluated by determining the proportion that received minimal chemotherapy alone, the proportion that had a first or second remission without the receipt of high-dose chemotherapy/stem cell rescue or higher dose involved-field radiation therapy (>21 grays), and overall survival.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 278 patients were eligible. At 4 years, 49.0% had received minimal chemotherapy and no radiation, 88.8% were in remission without receiving high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue or >21 grays of involved-field radiation therapy, and the overall survival rate was 99.6%. Patients who had mixed cellularity histology had a 4-year event-free survival (EFS) rate of 95.2%, which was significantly better than the 75.8% EFS for those who had nodular sclerosis histology (P\u2009=\u2009.008).

In this treatment paradigm, evaluation of increased chemotherapy intensity or the integration of active new agents is indicated for patients who have nodular sclerosis histology with a high ESR or who have a positive PET1 result.
