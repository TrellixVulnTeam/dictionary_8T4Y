<p id="Par42">The proposed study is a prospective observational clinical trial designed to investigate in septic postoperative abdominal surgical patients: (a) levels of circulating stem cells, HIF-1, and SDF-1a; (b) the interrelationship among stem cells, HIF-1, and SDF-1a; and (c) the correlation of those factors with outcomes for septic postoperative abdominal surgical patients treated with CT alone or with HCT. The rationale is that a deep and integrated molecular understanding of sepsis at the system level will indicate which molecular processes need to be regulated to recover the innate immunity homeostasis.</p>
