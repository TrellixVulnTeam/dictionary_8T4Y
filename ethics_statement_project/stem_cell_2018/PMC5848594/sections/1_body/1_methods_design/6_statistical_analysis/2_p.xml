<p id="Par41">The normality of the distribution will be assessed by the Shapiro–Wilkinson test. If the data are normally distributed, they will be expressed as mean (± standard deviation). The data will be analyzed using the repeated measurements analysis of variance. Differences between the groups at each time point will be examined post hoc using an independent sample 
 <italic>t</italic> test. A paired sample 
 <italic>t</italic> test will be used to detect changes within the groups. The level of statistical significance was chosen as 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. The statistical analysis will be performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) version 15.0 for Windows.
