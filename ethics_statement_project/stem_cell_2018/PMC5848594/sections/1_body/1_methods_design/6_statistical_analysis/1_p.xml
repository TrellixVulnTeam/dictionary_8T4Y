<p id="Par40">The power analysis suggested that a sample size of 30 patients per group is required to detect a higher percentage of total circulating EPCs (CD133+/CD34+ cells as a percentage of all myelomonocytic cells) in septic patients vs ICU controls (assuming α = .05 and power = .95) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This number is increased to 33 per group to allow for a 20% drop-out rate.
