<p id="Par22">In this trial, we hypothesize that levels of CD133/CD34, HIF-1, and SDF-1a will increase in septic surgical patients as a consequence of impaired tissue perfusion and cellular hypoxia. Our hypothesis is that the stimulation of hypoxia-related factors, like SDF-1a and HIF-1, could be the primary step in the stimulation of BM stem cells. Furthermore, we assume that surviving septic patients will show higher levels of EPCs, HIF-1, and SDF-1a.</p>
