We performed a phase 1 trial to determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated or recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D), and pharmacokinetics (PK) of eribulin in children with refractory or recurrent solid (excluding central nervous system) tumors. METHODS:Eribulin was administered intravenously on days 1 and 8 in 21-day cycles. Three dose levels (1.1, 1.4, and 1.8\u00a0mg/m2 /dose) were evaluated using the rolling six design with additional patients enrolled into a PK expansion cohort at the MTD. PK samples were obtained following the day 1, cycle 1 dose. RESULTS:Twenty-three patients, ages 3-17 (median 14) years were enrolled; 20 were evaluable for toxicity. DLTs occurred in 0/6 and 1/6 subjects at the 1.1 and 1.4\u00a0mg/m2 /dose, respectively. One subject at the 1.4\u00a0mg/m2 /dose had grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3 fatigue. At the 1.8\u00a0mg/m2 /dose, 2/5 subjects experienced dose-limiting (grade 4) neutropenia. Grade 3/4 non-DLTs included lymphopenia and hypokalemia, while low-grade toxicities included anorexia and nausea. No episodes of grade\u00a0>\u00a02 corrected QT interval prolongation or peripheral neuropathy were reported. Eribulin pharmacokinetic parameters were highly variable; the median elimination half-life was 39.6 (range 24.2-96.4) hr. A partial response was observed in one patient (Ewing sarcoma). CONCLUSIONS:Eribulin was well tolerated in children with refractory or recurrent solid tumors with neutropenia identified as the primary DLT.
