<p id="Par26">Our study indicates that there may be a long-term benefit to DFMO maintenance therapy even in those who have relapsed or responded poorly to standard induction therapyâ€”groups that historically have had poor long-term survival. This effect appears to be greater for subjects with primary refractory disease than those who initially responded to treatment and then experienced a relapse, a difference that is currently being studied further in a follow up clinical trial with each cohort being studied independently. In addition, these groups in particular may merit evaluation of early combination of DFMO with standard chemotherapy in an effort to produce a sustainable remission and thus further improve survival rates.</p>
