<p id="Par29">In summary, by inhibiting ODC and decreasing intracellular polyamine levels, DFMO targets a novel pathway and therefore is likely to provide a novel therapeutic strategy for maintaining long-term remission in children with high-risk neuroblastoma. DFMO given to children with high risk NB following completion of either standard multimodal therapy or salvage therapy for relapsed/refractory disease was both well tolerated and appeared to improve the event free and overall survival rates when compared to historical controls. A confirmatory Phase II and a randomized clinical trial utilizing DFMO during immunotherapy are both ongoing.</p>
