<p id="Par21">The primary objective of NMTRC003 was to evaluate the EFS of children with HRNB who received DFMO as maintenance therapy either after completion of standard therapy for high risk NB or after therapy for relapsed/refractory disease. Subjects received 750 ± 250 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> twice daily of DFMO for 2 years. Those treated after completion of standard therapy started DFMO at a median of 1.2 months from the last dose of retinoic acid and demonstrated a two-year EFS of 84% and OS of 97% with minimal and easily managed toxicity. Those receiving DFMO after therapy for relapse/refractory disease had a two-year EFS of 51% and OS of 84%.
