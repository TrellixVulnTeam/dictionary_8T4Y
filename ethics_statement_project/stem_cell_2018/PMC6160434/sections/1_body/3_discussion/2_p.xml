 </sup> in which responses were seen at all dose levels and pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated an overall maximum serum DFMO concentration of 14.2 ± 7.9 mcg/mL in subjects receiving 750 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup>. Previous studies in adults have shown that DFMO at this concentration is effective and has achieved desired biological activity as demonstrated by a decrease in urinary polyamines and ODC activity, and has been described as suitable target concentration for metronomic therapy
