<p id="Par25">Treatment for relapsed/refractory NB involves many therapeutic approaches, often involving Phase I and II chemotherapy trials. These generally have, at best, conferred modest response rates with high rates of subsequent relapse. A recent review of studies determined that historical rates of progression free survival (PFS) and OS for relapse therapies at 1 and 4 years were 21% ± 2% and 6% ± 1%, respectively, and the OS rates were 57% ± 3% and 20% ± 2%, respectively. Outcomes were worse for those with tumors having MYCN amplification: 1- and 4-year PFS of 13% ± 6% and 0%, respectively, and OS of 30% ± 8% and 0%, respectively

 </sup>. In contrast, relapsed/refractory patients with MYCN-amplified tumors in our study had 1- and 4-year PFS of 71% ± 17% and 57% ± 19%, respectively, and OS of 86% ± 13% and 69% ± 19%, respectively. This suggests that DFMO may benefit these especially challenging patients. Of note, a recent Phase I study at MSKCC evaluating administration of an anti-tumor vaccine following standard therapy suggested that alternative maintenance therapy to prevent relapse in high-risk patients may be beneficial
