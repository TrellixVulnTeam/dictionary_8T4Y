 </sup>. Subjects received DFMO for up to two years, with the addition of oral etoposide during weeks 4–15 of therapy. Responses were seen at all dose levels tested, with no apparent association between DFMO dose and response. While the median progression free survival (PFS) for all 18 evaluable subjects on this study was 80.5 days (95% CI: 62–418 days), three subjects completed 2 years of DFMO therapy and, without any additional treatment, remain alive and free of relapse over 6–8 years from completion of DFMO. This suggests that a subset of children with active NB may achieve a durable response and long- term remission from DFMO.
