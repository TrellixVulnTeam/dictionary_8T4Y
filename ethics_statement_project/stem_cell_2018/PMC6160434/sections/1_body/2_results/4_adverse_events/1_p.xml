<p id="Par20">DFMO was well tolerated without any serious adverse events (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). 67% of subjects reported no treatment-related adverse events. The most common reported toxicity was Grade 2-3 transaminitis (&lt;10 X ULN). Of note, this toxicity did not necessitate the holding of DFMO treatment and resolved with continued treatment. 76% of subjects had pre-existing hearing loss at study entry, and during this study 5 (4%) subjects had an increase in hearing loss that required temporarily holding DFMO. Hearing loss with DFMO is reversible and returned to baseline levels in all subjects, and all were able to complete DFMO treatment without further hearing loss. One subject experienced Grade 4 hypoglycemia during an episode of viral gastritis (vomiting and inability to tolerate feeds) while on DFMO, which therefore was considered possibly treatment-related. The patient was restarted on DFMO without further episodes of hypoglycemia.
