 </sup>. The results from our Phase I study suggested that genetic variability affecting ODC expression, specifically the rs2302616 SNP, was associated with increased polyamines, enhanced susceptibility to the ODC inhibitor DFMO and subsequent increased responsiveness to DFMO containing therapies in patients with NB

 </sup> (although the association of genotype with event-free survival did not reach statistical significance). However, in this study we found no significant association between rs2302616 genotype and EFS or OS (p = 0.96). (Table
