<p id="Par14">Subjects had received various standard upfront treatment regimens, including those enrolled on or treated as per COG protocols (81%), MSKCC (4%), SIOPEN (9%), and other (6%). Within the ITT population, 81 subjects had previously enrolled and completed antibody therapy on the post-randomization extension of COG ANBL0032. Patients without active disease or recurrence on post-antibody scans were eligible. As previously noted, sixteen subjects had residual stable MIBG-avid tumor at the end of antibody therapy and were further evaluated by PET; all were PET negative and therefore no subjects were excluded because of the presence of stable residual disease.</p>
