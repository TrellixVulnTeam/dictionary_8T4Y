<p id="Par12">Most subjects enrolled on Stratum 1 had either no evidence for persistent tumor masses, or residual tumor that was no longer MIBG avid (therefore either VGPR or PR). However, 16 of 111 screened subjects did have radiographic evidence of MIBG-positive residual disease; however, all of these underwent FDG-PET scanning that did not show increased metabolic activity in the residual masses, and thus all of these patients were enrolled. Characteristics of eligible subjects are summarized in TableÂ
