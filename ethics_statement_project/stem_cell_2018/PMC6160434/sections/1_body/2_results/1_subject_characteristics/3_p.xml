<p id="Par13">All 140 eligible subjects received DFMO and were eligible for safety analysis. After central review one stratum 1 subject did not meet inclusion criteria due to starting DFMO &gt; 120 days after the completion of standard therapy; this subject was excluded from the ITT analysis but did complete DFMO therapy with relapse. Thus, 139 subjects were eligible for the intention to treat (ITT) analysis (Fig.
