<p>Baseline characteristics at start of first-line treatment are shown in 
 <xref rid="t1-1040797" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Median age at first-line treatment was 71 years (range 31–96 years). Thirty-four percent were females and the majority (53%) had advanced disease with Rai stages III-IV. Patients were generally in a good performance status with 97% in Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group (ECOG) grade 0–2. In total, results of cytogenetic assessment were available for 599 patients (57%); more results were available in the latter time period (64% 2010–2013 
 <italic>vs</italic>. 47% 2007–2009). Since 2010, when FISH was generally recommended in the national guidelines, there has been a significant difference in the frequency of cytogenetic analysis between the regions (50.8-72.5%; 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.003) and cytogenetic analysis has been more often performed at university hospitals (80%) than other types of hospitals (55-60%) (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). The older the patient, the more rarely was the analysis performed. In the younger patient group [&lt;65 years (y)], cytogenetic analysis was available in 87% compared to 75% and 39% in the middle aged (65-74 y) and oldest (≥75 y) groups, respectively. The frequency of del(17p) was 4% and 11% in the earlier and later time periods, respectively, out of all patients tested (n=599).
