<p>The majority (68%) of patients started first-line treatment in the later time period (2010-2013). Most patients (63%) were treated at County/Rural hospitals (i.e. neither university nor regional hospitals), whereas 32% received their treatment at university hospitals. In almost all cases, the treatment decision was taken at the same institution as that in which the patient was subsequently treated. First-line treatments are shown in 
 <xref rid="t2-1040797" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Type of treatment was unknown in 4 patients and in 4 could not be evaluated. The most frequently used regimens were: chlorambucil (CLB/CLB-R) (39%), FCR (27%) and FC (16%). Nearly all patients (95%) receiving CLB did not receive rituximab. Only 6% of the patients received bendamustin (B) or (BR) and almost all were treated in the later study period. For all regimens, dosing intensity was similar across geographical regions and type of institution. Treatment was given according to the national guidelines in 80% (n=843) of the patients, 5% (n=49) were included in clinical trials, and in 15% (n=153) the treatment was individual, i.e. neither according to guidelines nor to a clinical protocol. The median age was higher for patients receiving chlorambucil (79 y) and younger for patients receiving FCR (64 y) compared to other chemotherapy-based regimens (F/FC 68 y, B/BR 72 y, CHOP/CVP +/- R 71 y). The median age in the CLB group did not change over the study period. In patients aged 75 y or over, 73% received CLB, F/FC (9%) and B/BR (5%), whereas in patients under 65 years of age, the most commonly used treatment was FCR (53%) followed by F/FC (22%). Those who received CLB also generally had a worse performance status, with 20% in ECOG 2â€“3 compared to 4% and 5% of those receiving FCR and BR, respectively. Notably, university hospitals used CLB significantly (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.01) less often (30%) than other types of hospitals (43%). The use of CLB declined significantly over the years, with 58% usage in 2007 to 31% in 2013 (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001). However, by the end of 2013, the CLB first-line usage was still high, varying between regions from 27% to 49%.
