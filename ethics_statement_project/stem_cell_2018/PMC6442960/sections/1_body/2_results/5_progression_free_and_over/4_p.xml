 <italic>versus</italic> 54 months, respectively. Those treated according to national guidelines showed a median PFS and OS of 26 months and 58 months, respectively. The correlating time for those treated outside trials or guidelines were 13 months and 44 months, respectively and for those in clinical trials 19 months and 66 months, respectively. Patients on medication with ASA or statins also showed a significantly shorter PFS and OS (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001 and 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.007) (by univariate analysis only).
