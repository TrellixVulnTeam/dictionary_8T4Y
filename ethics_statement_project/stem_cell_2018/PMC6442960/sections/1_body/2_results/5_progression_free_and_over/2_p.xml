<p>Progression-free survival in relation to type of first-line therapy is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1040797">Figure 1A</xref>. As expected, the longest PFS was observed with FCR, whereas the median PFS in patients who received CLB was only nine months. PFS in relation to FISH results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1040797">Figure 1B</xref>. Shortest PFS was observed for del(17p). Similar results were observed for type of treatment and FISH data in relation to OS (
