<p>In a multivariate analysis, both PFS and OS were significantly associated with type of treatment, cytogenetic status, performance status, gender and age (
 <xref rid="t3-1040797" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). OS was also significantly associated with geographical region (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.003). There was a tendency but no significant difference (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.07) in OS between the two time periods (2007-2009 
 <italic>vs</italic>. 2010â€“2013). IGHV analysis was only performed in a small fraction of patients and did not provide sufficient power when included in the model (both PFS and OS were non-significant). Thus, this analysis was excluded from multivariate analysis regarding this time period. However, we also analyzed the prognostic impact of IGHV on the whole study population. The results from this analysis showed a prognostic impact of IGHV status both on OS (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) and PFS (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.02) (
 <italic>data not shown</italic>).
