 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), del(17p) (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.007), age (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), and compliance to national guidelines (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.003), but not with gender, Rai stage or type of hospital (univariate analysis). Patients included in clinical trials showed a numerically better response rate (82%) than those treated according to national guidelines (65%) and compared to patients treated neither according to guidelines nor to a clinical study protocol (54%).
