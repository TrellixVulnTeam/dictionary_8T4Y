 </sup> patients were grouped into an earlier treatment period (2007–2009) and a later period (2010–2013). Multivariate analyses were restricted to the latter cohort. Analysis of the impact of IGHV mutation status did not provide sufficient power for this time period (only a small fraction of patients was tested); this was, therefore, excluded from the multivariate analysis. However, regarding IGHV, the prognostic impact of the whole population was analyzed separately. Patients who had received allogeneic stem cell transplant after first-line therapy (n=2) were excluded from PFS and OS analysis.
