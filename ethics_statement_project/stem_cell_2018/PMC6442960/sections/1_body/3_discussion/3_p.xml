 </sup> and the advanced stage combined with good performance status reflects treatment indication and first-line treatment status. The majority of patients were treated in the later time period which possibly suggests that most patients with CLL do not have a treatment indication at the time of diagnosis. Cytogenetic status was only available in 58% of the patients. The analysis was not mandatory until 2010 according to the national guidelines while FISH was more commonly performed in the later time period (2010-2013). Notably, university hospitals performed FISH significantly more often, and the older the patient the more rarely was the analysis performed.
