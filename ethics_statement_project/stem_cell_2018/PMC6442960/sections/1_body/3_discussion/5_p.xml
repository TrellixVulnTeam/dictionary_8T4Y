<p>The different types of treatments used may at least partly reflect the development of therapies over time. In fact, FCR was used much more in the later time period and B/BR, which was not introduced until the end of the study period, was used less. Even though CLB use declined during the study period, approximately one-third of all patients still received first-line CLB as late as 2013, although with significant regional differences. Regarding FCR and BR, the response rate was slightly lower than in prospective first-line clinical studies

 </sup> and for CLB it was slightly higher.

 </sup> As expected, and in line with recently published data,

 </sup> FCR was more commonly used in younger patients and CLB was the most frequently used treatment overall and in the elderly. The median age for CLB-treated patients did not increase over time, possibly indicating that more modern treatments, such as B/BR, were not always used in patients over 65 years of age. OS differed between the two time periods (2007-2009 
 <italic>vs</italic>. 2010â€“2013), but this difference was not significant. This is in line with our previous findings regarding second-line therapy in the Stockholm region,
