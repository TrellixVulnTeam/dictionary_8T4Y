<p>In summary, our results provide additional information representative of real-world outcome of first-line CLL treatment and provide an important context within which to evaluate the findings obtained from clinical trials of new drugs. We show that outcome in real-world situations differs from that in clinical trials, and that single-agent CLB treatment, as well as age and performance status, were independent factors for poor outcome in multivariate analysis. Notably, the older the patient the more rarely was FISH analysis performed and the more often CLB was chosen as treatment. As CLL and related complications seem to be the major cause of death in patients, regardless of comorbidity,

 </sup> also elderly, comorbid patients should preferably undergo cytogenetic analysis and receive treatments for adequate disease control. Hence, we conclude that alternative modern, effective first-line treatment alternatives must be offered to elderly comorbid patients. Our study also raises the question as to whether drugs other than CLB, even if combined with a CD20 antibody,

 </sup> should be considered as the chemotherapy approach in the standard-of-care arm in pivotal clinical trials. Finally, we have also demonstrated inter-regional differences in drug and FISH usage, and that outcome may vary in different parts of the country despite regular updates on generally available national CLL guidelines; findings which need to be further investigated in detail.
