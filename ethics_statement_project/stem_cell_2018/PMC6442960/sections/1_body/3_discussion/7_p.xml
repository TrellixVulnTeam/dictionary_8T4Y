 </sup> and as many as 39% received CLB and CLB treatment was associated with poorer outcome. In addition, cytogenetic status, the strongest predictor of outcome, was unknown in almost half the patients. These factors may at least partly explain the differences in our results and those reported in trials.

 </sup> However, these regimens were used only in the elderly, and only FCR and FC showed better outcomes. The difference in OS between the time periods was not significant (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.07), and this may possibly be influenced by the low use of FCR and by the fact that bendamustine became available only at the end of the time period. IGHV mutation status is still optional in the Swedish guidelines, probably explaining the low number of patients analyzed. Thus, the power of the analysis was insufficient for the multivariate analysis. However, our findings for the whole population was in line with previous reports
