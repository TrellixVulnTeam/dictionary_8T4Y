<p>Our study indicates that type of hospital may possibly have an impact on outcome but could not confirm previous findings

 <italic>versus</italic> rural regions. The possible differences between type of hospitals may derive from the fact that FISH analysis was more often performed at university hospitals, and the widespread use of the regularly up-dated Swedish National Guidelines may have minimized the difference between regions as 80% were treated according to guidelines. The regional usage of chlorambucil varied between 27â€“49%. We still have no explanation for this. Elderly patients and those with a poorer performance status might also be on concomitant medication with ASA or statins, i.e. those with certain comorbidity. This may explain why concomitant ASA or statins showed a significant association in univariate but not in multivariate analysis.
