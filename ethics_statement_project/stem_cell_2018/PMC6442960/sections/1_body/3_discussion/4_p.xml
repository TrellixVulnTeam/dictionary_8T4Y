<p>The vast majority (80%) were treated according to the national guidelines. Notably, compliance to national guidelines was associated with better response, and PFS and OS (univariate analysis). However, patients included in clinical trials had an even better ORR and OS but a shorter PFS. This may partly be due to our conservative approach on how to interpret response, i.e. if not all variables for a complete or partial response where available responses were considered to be of a lower grade. As patients in studies may have been more thoroughly evaluated, variables for response were possibly more available; this may have resulted in a higher response rate for these patients. Also, selection bias or more effective regimens and a more thorough follow up in clinical trials (which may detect progression at an earlier stage) may have influenced the results.</p>
