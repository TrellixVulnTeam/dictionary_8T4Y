<p>This is the largest retrospective cohort of strictly consecutive real-world patients from a well defined geographical region (Sweden) with a comparatively long complete follow up. By using high-quality Swedish data bases (National Cancer Registry/Swedish CLL-registry) including all patients diagnosed in Sweden within a specified time period, followed by in-depth analysis of each individual medical file, we were able to obtain a complete record of all patients diagnosed with and receiving first- line CLL treatment in the period 2007–2013. As office-based private medicine is practically non-existent for CLL in Sweden, all patient files were identified, ensuring high-quality data and minimal selection bias, which is a key strength of our report. The time period 2007–2013 was selected in order to obtain sufficient follow up.</p>
