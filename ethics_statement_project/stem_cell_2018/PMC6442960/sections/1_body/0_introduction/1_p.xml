<p>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in the Western world. In Sweden, the incidence is approximately 500 patients per year. The median age at diagnosis is approximately 70 years.

 </sup> The clinical course is extremely heterogeneous. At diagnosis, most patients are asymptomatic and the disease may be indolent for a long time. However, many patients show disease progression after a few years. When the disease requires treatment, strategies should be individualized.

 </sup> Chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine in combination with cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) resulted in an overall response rate (ORR) of about 90% and improved overall survival (OS),

 </sup> and represents the standard treatment in fit patients younger than 65 years. Yet, FCR is less well tolerated in patients over 65 years

 </sup> and these patients may instead benefit from bendamustine in combination with rituximab (BR) which has shown response rates similar to those achieved with FCR but with less toxicity.
