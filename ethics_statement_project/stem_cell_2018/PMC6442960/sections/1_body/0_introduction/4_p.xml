<p>The Swedish Cancer Registry and the Swedish National CLL-Registry give us a unique opportunity to identify all patients diagnosed with CLL for an in-depth analysis of every single patient file. This provides a complete record of all patients treated within a defined time period on a nation-wide basis. Thus, this study provides high-quality real-world results on CLL first-line treatment that may be used as quality assurance and may help to interpret the cost-effectiveness of new drugs for health-care providers. It may also serve as a control for clinical trials, selecting patients based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Given this, the aim of this study was to investigate the outcome following first-line therapy in a well-defined population of consecutive CLL patients, in a setting with complete follow up.</p>
