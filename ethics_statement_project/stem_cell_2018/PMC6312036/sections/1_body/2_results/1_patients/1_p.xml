<p>A total of 76 MCL patients were enrolled between November 2011 and December 2012 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1040138">Figure 1</xref>). All patients were monitored for 3 years after their last cycle of therapy. Two patients were excluded - one because of a misdiagnosis of MCL (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) and one because of exclusion criteria (hepatitis B) – leaving 74 patients for data analyses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1040138">Figure 1</xref>). Seventy-one patients had MCL confirmed by central review. The diagnosis was made on tumor biopsies (45 on lymph nodes and 26 on extranodal tissue). Due to unsuccessful tissue biopsy in three patients, a diagnosis of MCL was made by flow cytometry in peripheral blood (1 patient) or bone marrow (2 patients). Ki67 staining was performed in 56 patients, and was found ≥30% positive in 59% of these patients (31 of 56 patients) (
