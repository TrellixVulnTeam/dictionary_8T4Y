<p>Fifteen patients of 74 (20%) stopped treatment before the sixth cycle, four because of death (1 case each of pneumonia and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and 2 cardiac arrests), five because of grade 3-4 toxicity [septicemia (n=1), neuropathy (n=2), digestive tract toxicity (n=1) and pleural effusion (n=1)], three because of progression or stable disease and three for other causes (

 <xref rid="t3-1040138" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Neutropenia translated into febrile neutropenia in 11 patients (11%), which was grade 3-4 in six. Lymphopenia at the end of treatment was reported in 65% of the patients (48/70) and was mainly grade 3-4 (lymphocytes &lt;0.5Ã—10
 <sup>9</sup>/L) (
 <xref rid="t3-1040138" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Persistent grade 3-4 lymphopenia was seen in 28.8% of patients at 1 year after the completion of treatment (17 of 59 surviving patients who could be evaluated). Forty-two patients (56.7%) had non-hematologic grade 3-4 toxicities at the end of treatment (
 <xref rid="t3-1040138" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The most frequent non-hematologic toxicities (seen in more than 10% of patients) were fatigue, peripheral neuropathy and fever with or without neutropenia, which occurred in 18.5% (n=14), 15% (n=11) and 15 (n=11) of cases, respectively (
 <xref rid="t3-1040138" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Other toxicities were reported in four or fewer patients (i.e. less than 6%) and were as follows: pulmonary toxicity, cardiac toxicity, hyperglycemia, elevated transaminases, digestive tract toxicity, cutaneous rash, allergy and fever without neutropenia. No patient experienced cytomegalovirus reactivation or pneumocystis infection.
