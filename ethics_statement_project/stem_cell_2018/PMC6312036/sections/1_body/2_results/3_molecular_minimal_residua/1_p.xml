<p>Molecular MRD was assessed in a total of 58 of the 74 patients eligible for MRD analysis (in all, 732 samples were assessed, see 
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S1</italic>). Molecular MRD analysis was not possible in 16 of 74 MRD-eligible patients because of a lack of MRD target (n=6), missing follow-up samples (n=9) or because an MRD target reference sample was not available (n=1) (

After four cycles (midterm), 57 patients were analyzed for molecular MRD (57 peripheral blood samples; 48 bone marrow samples, of which 48 patients with paired bone marrow and peripheral blood MRD samples, at the mid-term analysis). Of these, 50 patients were negative for molecular MRD (32 in complete remission, 18 in partial remission) and seven were positive (2 in complete remission, 4 in partial remission and 1 with stable disease) in the blood and/or bone marrow, for a molecular response rate of 79% (defined by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay with a sensitivity of 10

After six cycles of treatment, 54 patients were analyzed for molecular MRD (54 peripheral blood samples; 46 bone marrow samples, of which 46 patients with paired bone marrow and peripheral blood samples for MRD analysis at the end of treatment). Of these 54 patients, 41 were MRD-negative (39 in complete remission, 1 in partial remission and 1 with stable disease) and 13 were MRD-positive (8 in complete remission, 4 in partial remission and 1 with progressive disease) in blood and/or bone marrow (76% molecular response rate) (
