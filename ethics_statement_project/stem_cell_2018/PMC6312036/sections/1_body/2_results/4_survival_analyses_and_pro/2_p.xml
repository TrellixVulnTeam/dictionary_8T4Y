<p>The 2-year PFS was 70.3% compared to 57.6% at 4 years. The 2-year OS was 81.1% compared to 71.3% at 4 years. The Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (MIPI) score was not predictive for PFS or OS perhaps due to the small number of patients because a trend could be observed (
 <xref rid="t2-1040138" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S2A</italic>). Indeed, the 4-year OS for the 58 MIPI high-risk patients was 66.8% compared to 85.7% for the 14 MIPI low- or intermediate-risk patients (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.13). Neither histology (classical subtype 
 <italic>versus</italic> blastoid subtype) nor Ki67 expression (&lt;30% 
 <italic>versus</italic> â‰¥30% of positive MCL cells in the tumor biopsy) was predictive for OS (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.10 and 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.24, respectively) or PFS (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.08 and 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.13, respectively) (
 <xref rid="t2-1040138" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S2B</italic>). Clinical responses (complete or partial response 
 <italic>versus</italic> no response), as assessed by the Cheson 1999 criteria, were highly predictive for PFS or OS whether determined at the mid-term staging or at the end of treatment. There were no survival differences (PFS or OS) between patients in partial or complete remission. Neither mid-term nor final FDG-PET scan responses were predictive for PFS or OS. The most highly predictive factor for PFS and OS (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001) was MRD status in peripheral blood at the end of treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-1040138">Figure 2C</xref>, right panel and 
 <xref rid="t2-1040138" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Molecular blood MRD status at mid-term was also significant for PFS (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.01) and weakly significant for OS (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.047) (
 <xref rid="t2-1040138" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). By contrast, MRD status in the bone marrow after four cycles of treatment (mid-term) or at the end of treatment was not predictive for either PFS or OS (see 
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S3</italic> for end-of-treatment data). The 4-year OS for patients who were MRD-negative in blood at the end of treatment (n=47/54) was 86.6% compared to 28.6% for blood MRD-positive patients (n=7/54).
