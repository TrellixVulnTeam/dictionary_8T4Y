 </sup> The number of patients to be enrolled was calculated by a one-step Fleming method. In order to define superiority of the RiBVD regimen over R-CHOP, a PFS rate of 65% or more (H1) was required at 18 months. The treatment was to be considered a failure if the PFS rate at 18 months was â‰¤50%. Taking into account alpha and beta risks of 5% and 20%, respectively, 69 patients needed to be enrolled. Based on a maximum 10% error in diagnosis, 76 patients had to be enrolled. Additional details are given in the
