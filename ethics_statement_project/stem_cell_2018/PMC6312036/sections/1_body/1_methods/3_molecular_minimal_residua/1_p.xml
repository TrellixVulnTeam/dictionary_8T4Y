<p>Molecular responses were evaluated centrally by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction targeted to patient-specific,

 </sup> Minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis was performed before treatment (baseline), after four courses of treatment (mid-term MRD), and at the end of treatment (after 6 courses of RiBVD) in peripheral blood and bone marrow until progression or relapse, for a maximum follow-up period of 3 years.

 </sup> During the follow-up, MRD was evaluated in the blood at 3 monthly intervals for 1 year and every 6 months thereafter while bone marrow MRD monitoring was performed at yearly intervals. A description of additional methods, the MRD study cohort, sample source and numbers is given in the 
 <italic>Online Supplementary Methods</italic> and illustrated in 
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S1</italic>.
