 </sup> The addition of bortezomib to rituximab-anthracycline-based regimens has improved the results, compared to those achieved by R-CHOP, for frontline therapy in MCL, leading to a complete response rate of 50% and a median PFS of 25 months albeit with increased hematologic toxicity.

 </sup> Two phase III trials have shown the superiority of bendamustine-rituximab combination therapy over R-CHOP or R-CHOP/R-CVP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone) with respect to overall and complete response rates and reduced toxicity.

 </sup> However, superior PFS was observed in only one of the latter phase III studies.

 </sup> More recently, combining genotoxic agents (such as cytarabine) or targeted agents (such as bortezomib or lenalidomide) with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) has shown efficacy in both first-line and salvage therapy in MCL.
