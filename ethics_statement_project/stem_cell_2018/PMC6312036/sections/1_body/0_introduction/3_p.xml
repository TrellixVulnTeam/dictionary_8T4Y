<p>In anticipation of the above findings, our group initiated a phase II trial to assess the efficacy of a new regimen combining rituximab, bortezomib, bendamustine and dexamethasone (RiBVD) for first-line therapy of older MCL patients. Specifically, for the trial design, associating RiBVD, we took into account the interim results of the BR regimen, for which the reported overall response rates were 90% in relapsing MCL patients,

 </sup> and the promising results (32% overall response rate) of bortezomib monotherapy in relapsing MCL patients (PINNACLE study).
