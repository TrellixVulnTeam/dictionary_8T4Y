<p>Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare subtype of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by the genetic hallmark t(11;14)(q13;q32) chromosomal translocation which leads to overexpression of cyclin D1.

 </sup> The standard-of-care for the treatment of older MCL patients (&gt;65 years), has been eight cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) given at 21-day intervals (R-CHOP-21), followed by maintenance therapy which has been shown to improve response duration and overall survival (OS) in patients who reach the maintenance phase.

 </sup> Complete response rates do, however, remain low with R-CHOP (30-35%) and the median progression-free survival (PFS) is in the range of 14-18 months.

 </sup> After R-CHOP and maintenance therapy, the 4-year OS rate was 87%.

 </sup> Although dose-intensive and high-dose cytarabine-containing regimens, with or without autologous stem cell transplantation consolidation in younger patients, has improved outcomes (the median PFS is now well in excess of 5 years), such approaches are frequently not feasible, given that the median age at diagnosis of MCL is in the mid to late 60s.
