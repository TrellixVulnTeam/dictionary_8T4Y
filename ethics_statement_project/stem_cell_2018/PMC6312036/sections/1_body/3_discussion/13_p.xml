<p>In conclusion, our results identify the combination of rituximab, bendamustine bortezomib and dexamethasone, without maintenance therapy, as a promising treatment option in MCL patients â‰¥65 years old. The RiBVD regimen compares favorably with other treatment strategies used in this setting, although randomized trials are still lacking. Prolonged PFS appears to result from rapid clearance of (re)circulating tumor B cells in the post-induction phase. Continued molecular remission in the blood was predictive of prolonged survival, indicating that molecular MRD monitoring and molecular response offer significant potential as precision medicine tools for early and late clinical decision-making in MCL.</p>
