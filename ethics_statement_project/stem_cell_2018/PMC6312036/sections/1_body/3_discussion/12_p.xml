<p>MRD positivity at the end of treatment or at 1 year of follow-up was found to be highly predictive for early relapse (at 11 and 26 months, respectively) in patients treated with the RiBVD regimen. Although numbers of MRD-negative patients were small, these findings add further weight to the notion that achieving durable molecular remission is an important goal in MCL. Indeed, maintenance therapy and/or pre-emptive treatment directed to patients in molecular relapse or remaining MRD-positive after treatment has been shown to play a significant role in prolonging clinical response in MCL.

 </sup> The choice of maintenance or a pre-emptive therapy strategy may depend on the nature of initial therapy, as highlighted by a recent study that failed to show the benefit of rituximab maintenance after bendamustine.
