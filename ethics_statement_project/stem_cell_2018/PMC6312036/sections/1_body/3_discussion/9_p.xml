<p>In this study, molecular response in peripheral blood at the end of treatment (after 6 RiBVD cycles) was identified as a major predictive factor for PFS and OS, thus further emphasizing the importance of the depth of response, beyond standard clinical complete response, in MCL.

 </sup> Indeed, there was no difference in OS between patients in complete or partial remission at the end of treatment, as defined by the IWG criteria with or without FDG-PET. This finding supports the notion that PET and molecular MRD provide different prognostic information in MCL, probably because they are measuring different types of disease activity, in different disease compartments, with differing sensitivities. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) defined by FDG-PET, also described as an independent prognosis factor, was not analyzed in our cohort.
