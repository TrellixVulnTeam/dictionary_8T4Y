<p>Unexpectedly, neither the MIPI nor Ki67 scores (30% cut-off) had any impact on PFS or OS with the RiBVD regimen. This may reflect differences in treatment efficacy by RiBVD in patients with high-risk MIPI scores (70% OS at 36 months), compared to the efficacy of historical treatment controls in the original patient cohort that was used to define the high-risk MIPI score (40% OS at 36 months).
