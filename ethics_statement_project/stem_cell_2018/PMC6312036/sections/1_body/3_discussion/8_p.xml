<p>Contrary to published results for subcutaneous administration of bortezomib, we noted a relatively high incidence of grade 3-4 neurotoxicity, which is a limiting factor for the RiBVD regimen.

 </sup> Although the incidence was comparable to that observed in our previous RiPAD+C trial (18% grade 3-4 toxicity, 7/39 patients), in which bortezomib was administered intravenously at the same dose,

 </sup> it is higher than that observed in other studies using comparable intravenous doses in which grade 3-4 toxicity was reported in 7% to 8% of patients treated with R-BV (rituximab, bendamustine, and bortezomib) and VR-CAP regimens.

 </sup> Further investigations will be required to understand the reason for this. Of note in this respect is the discovery of genetic risk loci for severe peripheral neuropathy in European patients with multiple myeloma treated with bortezomib.
