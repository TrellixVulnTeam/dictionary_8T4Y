 </sup> a recent phase II trial from an Italian group (FIL) confirmed the efficacy of the R-BAC500 regimen (which associates rituximab, bendamustine and cytarabine) for treatment of older MCL patients.

 </sup> In updated clinical results for the R-BAC500 regimen, complete response rates of 93% and molecular response rates of 78% (35/45) in the blood have been reported.
