 </sup> The rate of lymphopenia at 1 year was 32.5%, which is indicative of longer-term immunosuppression with the RiBVD regimen. Whether this is related to the use of dexamethasone or to the immunosuppressive effects of bendamustine remains to be established but indicates that precautionary measures to control infection are advisable.
