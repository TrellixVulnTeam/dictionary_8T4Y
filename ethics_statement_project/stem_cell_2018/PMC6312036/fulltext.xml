A total of 74 patients were enrolled (median age, 73 years). Patients received a maximum of six cycles of treatment at 28-day intervals. The primary objective was to achieve an 18-month progression-free survival rate of 65% or higher. Secondary objectives were to evaluate toxicity and the prognostic impact of mantle cell lymphoma prognostic index, Ki67 expression, [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography and molecular minimal residual disease, in peripheral blood or bone marrow. With a median follow-up of 52 months, the 24-month progression-free survival rate was 70%, hence the primary objective was reached. After six cycles of treatment, 91% (54/59) of responding patients were analyzed for peripheral blood residual disease and 87% of these (47/54) were negative. Four-year overall survival rates of the patients who did not have or had detectable molecular residual disease in the blood at completion of treatment were 86.6% and 28.6%, respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). Neither the mantle cell lymphoma index, nor fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography nor Ki67 positivity (cut off of &#x02265;30%) showed a prognostic impact for survival. Hematologic grade 3-4 toxicities were mainly neutropenia (51%), thrombocytopenia (35%) and lymphopenia (65%). Grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicities were mainly fatigue (18.5%), neuropathy (15%) and infections. In conclusion, the tested treatment regimen is active as frontline therapy in older patients with mantle cell lymphoma, with manageable toxicity. Minimal residual disease status after induction could serve as an early predictor of survival in mantle cell lymphoma. <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>: NCT 01457144</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare subtype of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by the genetic hallmark t(11;14)(q13;q32) chromosomal translocation which leads to overexpression of cyclin D1.<sup><xref rid="b1-1040138" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The standard-of-care for the treatment of older MCL patients (&#x0003e;65 years), has been eight cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) given at 21-day intervals (R-CHOP-21), followed by maintenance therapy which has been shown to improve response duration and overall survival (OS) in patients who reach the maintenance phase.<sup><xref rid="b2-1040138" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Complete response rates do, however, remain low with R-CHOP (30-35%) and the median progression-free survival (PFS) is in the range of 14-18 months.<sup><xref rid="b3-1040138" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-1040138" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> After R-CHOP and maintenance therapy, the 4-year OS rate was 87%.<sup><xref rid="b2-1040138" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Although dose-intensive and high-dose cytarabine-containing regimens, with or without autologous stem cell transplantation consolidation in younger patients, has improved outcomes (the median PFS is now well in excess of 5 years), such approaches are frequently not feasible, given that the median age at diagnosis of MCL is in the mid to late 60s.<sup><xref rid="b1-1040138" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>Bortezomib was the first novel agent to be approved for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory MCL.<sup><xref rid="b5-1040138" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-1040138" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The addition of bortezomib to rituximab-anthracycline-based regimens has improved the results, compared to those achieved by R-CHOP, for frontline therapy in MCL, leading to a complete response rate of 50% and a median PFS of 25 months albeit with increased hematologic toxicity.<sup><xref rid="b7-1040138" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-1040138" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Two phase III trials have shown the superiority of bendamustine-rituximab combination therapy over R-CHOP or R-CHOP/R-CVP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone) with respect to overall and complete response rates and reduced toxicity.<sup><xref rid="b9-1040138" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-1040138" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> However, superior PFS was observed in only one of the latter phase III studies.<sup><xref rid="b9-1040138" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> More recently, combining genotoxic agents (such as cytarabine) or targeted agents (such as bortezomib or lenalidomide) with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) has shown efficacy in both first-line and salvage therapy in MCL.<sup><xref rid="b1-1040138" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b11-1040138" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13-1040138" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>In anticipation of the above findings, our group initiated a phase II trial to assess the efficacy of a new regimen combining rituximab, bortezomib, bendamustine and dexamethasone (RiBVD) for first-line therapy of older MCL patients.

This finding supports the notion that PET and molecular MRD provide different prognostic information in MCL, probably because they are measuring different types of disease activity, in different disease compartments, with differing sensitivities. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) defined by FDG-PET, also described as an independent prognosis factor, was not analyzed in our cohort.<sup><xref rid="b27-1040138" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p>Unexpectedly, neither the MIPI nor Ki67 scores (30% cut-off) had any impact on PFS or OS with the RiBVD regimen. This may reflect differences in treatment efficacy by RiBVD in patients with high-risk MIPI scores (70% OS at 36 months), compared to the efficacy of historical treatment controls in the original patient cohort that was used to define the high-risk MIPI score (40% OS at 36 months).<sup><xref rid="b28-1040138" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p>Peripheral blood, but not bone marrow-based MRD status, was highly predictive of PFS and OS in this study (4-year OS of 86.6% for MRD-negative patients compared to 28.6% for MRD-positive patients; (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). While for peripheral blood this is broadly in keeping with findings of the EU-MCL network for other treatment regimens,<sup><xref rid="b20-1040138" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> results concerning the prognostic impact of bone marrow molecular MRD, in patients treated with RiBVD, differ.<sup><xref rid="b20-1040138" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The prognostic impact of MRD in patients treated with the R-BAC500 regimen has not been reported as yet.<sup><xref rid="b24-1040138" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> One avenue of investigation for clarification of these issues will be testing of &#x02018;next generation&#x02019; cellular and molecular methods of MRD detection. Multi-parametric flow cytometry, although requiring very high levels of expertise, has been shown to be feasible and provide satisfactory sensitivity, when compared to highly standardized quantitative polymerase chain reaction methods in MCL.<sup><xref rid="b29-1040138" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> For molecular MRD, droplet digital polymerase chain reaction analysis is gaining interest<sup><xref rid="b30-1040138" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> as is molecular MRD assessment in circulating cell-free DNA in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.<sup><xref rid="b31-1040138" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b33-1040138" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Combinatorial approaches (metabolic, cellular/molecular) as reported here for MCL, and in follicular lymphoma,<sup><xref rid="b34-1040138" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> will also be useful. Ultimately, careful investigation of residual disease, particularly by combinatorial approaches, will be needed to further refine MRD-driven precision medicine approaches in lymphoma, and other cancers.<sup><xref rid="b35-1040138" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p><p>MRD positivity at the end of treatment or at 1 year of follow-up was found to be highly predictive for early relapse (at 11 and 26 months, respectively) in patients treated with the RiBVD regimen. Although numbers of MRD-negative patients were small, these findings add further weight to the notion that achieving durable molecular remission is an important goal in MCL. Indeed, maintenance therapy and/or pre-emptive treatment directed to patients in molecular relapse or remaining MRD-positive after treatment has been shown to play a significant role in prolonging clinical response in MCL.<sup><xref rid="b2-1040138" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b23-1040138" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b36-1040138" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="b37-1040138" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> The choice of maintenance or a pre-emptive therapy strategy may depend on the nature of initial therapy, as highlighted by a recent study that failed to show the benefit of rituximab maintenance after bendamustine.<sup><xref rid="b38-1040138" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p><p>In conclusion, our results identify the combination of rituximab, bendamustine bortezomib and dexamethasone, without maintenance therapy, as a promising treatment option in MCL patients &#x02265;65 years old. The RiBVD regimen compares favorably with other treatment strategies used in this setting, although randomized trials are still lacking. Prolonged PFS appears to result from rapid clearance of (re)circulating tumor B cells in the post-induction phase. Continued molecular remission in the blood was predictive of prolonged survival, indicating that molecular MRD monitoring and molecular response offer significant potential as precision medicine tools for early and late clinical decision-making in MCL.</p></sec>
