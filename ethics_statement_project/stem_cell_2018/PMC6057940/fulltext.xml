In mouse models of triple&#x000a0;negative breast cancer (TNBC), Hedgehog ligand produced by neoplastic cells reprograms cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to provide a supportive niche for the acquisition of a chemo-resistant, cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype via FGF5 expression and production of fibrillar collagen. Stromal treatment of patient-derived xenografts with smoothened inhibitors (SMOi) downregulates CSC markers expression and sensitizes tumors to docetaxel, leading to markedly improved survival and reduced metastatic burden. In the phase I clinical trial EDALINE, 3 of 12 patients with metastatic TNBC derived clinical benefit from combination therapy with the SMOi Sonidegib and docetaxel chemotherapy, with one patient experiencing a complete response. These studies identify Hedgehog signaling to CAFs as a novel mediator of CSC plasticity and an exciting new therapeutic target in TNBC.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Stromal cell recruitment, activation and crosstalk with cancer cells is poorly understood.

During development, dynamic interaction between stromal and epithelial cells drives patterning and function. Cell fate specification occurs through activation of transcriptional cascades in response to extracellular signals from developmental signaling pathways such as Hedgehog (Hh), Wnt, Notch, BMP (bone morphogenetic proteins), and FGF (fibroblast growth factor)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. These pathways direct developmental processes either by direct cell-to-cell contact or through secreted diffusible factors (paracrine signaling). They can act individually or in concert with each other. For example, the interaction between Hh and FGF signaling pathways has been shown to mediate tracheal and lung branching morphogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In mature, differentiated tissues, these pathways are quiescent but may be reactivated to drive repair and regeneration to maintain tissue homeostasis.</p><p id="Par4">More specifically, the Hh developmental pathway is reactivated in a subset of cancers. Binding of Hh ligand to its receptor Patched (PTCH) enables Smoothened (SMO)-mediated translocation of Gli1 into the cell nucleus to drive the transcription of Hh target genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Mutations in Hh pathway components are oncogenic drivers in &#x0201c;Gorlin&#x02019;s-like&#x0201d; cancers such as medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma where tumors rely on cell-autonomous Hh signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Small molecule inhibitors of SMO (SMOi), Vismodegib and Sonidegib, are well-tolerated and clinically approved for the treatment of these lesions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In contrast, many other solid tumors, including breast cancer, predominantly exhibit ligand-dependent pathway activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. While Hh signaling is quiescent in the adult mammary gland, Hh ligand expression is reactivated in a subset of breast cancers, particularly the poor-prognosis triple&#x000a0;negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Thirty percent of TNBCs exhibit paracrine Hh pathway signature, defined by high epithelial HH ligand expression in combination with high stromal GLI1 expression, which is associated with a greater risk of metastasis and breast cancer-specific death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Neoplastic cells co-opt components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) to further their progression. The TME is a complex ecosystem comprising a myriad of neoplastic and nonmalignant cells embedded in a glycoprotein-rich extracellular matrix (ECM). Prominent cell types include the endothelium, cells of the immune system and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). In addition to its role as a physical scaffold to support tissue architecture, the ECM also functions as a signal transducer between the different TME cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The stiffness of the ECM and the abundance of fibrillar collagen immediately adjacent to epithelial lesions provide mechanical signals that facilitate tumor development and progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Not surprisingly, the TME has emerged as a major determinant of cancer phenotype. In breast cancer, stromal metagenes, in particular those associated with ECM remodeling, strongly predict prognosis and response to chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">While it is now apparent that Hh signals in a paracrine manner in animal models of TNBC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and in isolated cancer stem cells (CSCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, a detailed study of the dynamic crosstalk within the TME is required to make clinical progress in integrating anti-stromal therapies into breast cancer treatment. Progress has been impeded by the field&#x02019;s limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying tumor&#x02212;stromal interactions, a limited repertoire of well-tolerated agents to target the TME, and an absence of predictive biomarkers for response to TME-directed therapies. In this study, we showed that CAFs are the primary stromal cells that respond to Hh ligand stimulation. Activated CAFs in turn provide a conducive environment for neoplastic cells to acquire a chemo-resistant stem-like phenotype. SMOi treatment sensitized tumors to docetaxel chemotherapy in mouse models and in patients from the EDALINE Phase I clinical trial, resulting in reduced metastatic burden and improved survival.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Hh-tumors are enriched for a reversible CSC-like phenotype</title><p id="Par7">To investigate the mechanistic basis for Hh-dependent tumor growth and metastasis in TNBC, we used the murine M6 allograft model of low grade TNBC, in which transgenic Hh expression drives invasion, metastasis, and high-grade morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> (M6-Hh; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>).

Firstly, we and others have provided evidence for the crucial role of CAFs in supporting CSC self-renewal and resistance to chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. Therefore, targeting the CAF population and the subsequent abolition of the CAF&#x02212;neoplastic cell interaction represent a practical strategy to improve cancer outcomes. Secondly, unlike neoplastic cells, CAFs have not been reported to exhibit genomic instability and are therefore less likely to acquire resistance to therapy over time, making them good targets for combination cancer therapies. Combined therapy with SMOi&#x02009;+&#x02009;docetaxel was well-tolerated by mice and humans, and effective in treating a proportion of women with metastatic disease who had previously failed on taxane chemotherapy, including one patient who experienced a complete response. While patient numbers are small, these remarkable results provide the first evidence to our knowledge for clinical benefit from a CAF-directed therapy. Treatment response in patients correlated with high levels of paracrine Hh signaling, FGFR activation and fibrillar collagen deposition, suggesting that the mechanism of action in patients may be consistent with that in mouse models. Hh, FGFR or collagen pathway activation may have value as predictive biomarkers of response to SMOi. Thirty percent of TNBCs show evidence of paracrine Hh pathway activity; SMO inhibitors could then represent therapeutics of interest for a significant number of women. Whilst phase I clinical trials are not designed nor powered to assess therapeutic efficacy, these data suggest an exciting new therapeutic strategy for drug-resistant or metastatic TNBC which should proceed to prospective assessment through Phase II clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="Par38">M6 murine mammary carcinoma cells derived from the C3(1)/SV40 Tag mouse model (gift from J.

The excitation source was a Ti:Sapphire femto-second laser cavity (Newport Mai Tai), coupled into an LSM 710 scan module. An excitation wavelength of 890&#x02009;nm was used to collect SHG signal (435&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;20&#x02009;nm) from collagen. Maximum collagen coverage values derived from SHG signal (by depth (line graph) and at peak value (histogram inset)) was used as a measure of collagen abundance and density. Signal was acquired from three separate areas measuring 320&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;320&#x02009;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> across each sample.

GLCM analysis was performed in ImageJ.</p><p id="Par65">Orientation analysis was carried out as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Briefly, fiber orientation analysis was performed on SHG images using an in-house ImageJ macro where structure tensors were derived from the local orientation and isotropic properties of pixels that make up collagen fibrils. Within each input image, these tensors were evaluated for each pixel by computing the continuous spatial derivatives in the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> dimensions using a cubic B-spline interpolation. From this, the local predominant orientation was obtained. The peak alignment (measured in degrees) of fibers was then determined, and the frequency of fiber alignment calculated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Alginate-Collagen I Inter-Penetrating Network hydrogels</title><p id="Par66">Alginate-Collagen I Inter-Penetrating Network (IPNs) hydrogels were generated from 1% sodium alginate mixed with either 20, 5 or 0% rat tail collagen I, plus 1% Matrigel.

The Chi-square test of Independence was assessed to examine the association between epithelial HH and stromal GLI1 expression and efficacy endpoints: best tumor response (complete or partial response, stable disease, progression disease, and Time to Progression (TTP)). TTP was defined as the time from treatment commencement until objective tumor progression (does not include deaths). Progression-free survival (PFS) was explored using Kaplan&#x02212;Meier survival analysis. PFS was defined as the time from treatment commencement until disease progression or death.
