 <p>A.S. conceived the project and directed the study with input from all authors. A.S.C. optimized the tumor dissociation, flow sorting, RNA isolation of low-input samples before Next Generation Sequencing, conducted mouse experiments and treatment on the M6 model. M.N.H. conducted the long-term SMO-combined therapy experiments in human preclinical models, tumorsphere assays and image analysis. A.S.C. and M.N.H. interpreted the RNA-Seq data, performed the IHC staining, coculture assays, RT-PCR experiments and all cell culture-related work. B.L.E. analyzed the RNA-Seq datasets. D.R. and N.D. helped with survival analysis using TCGA data and other bioinformatics. C.C. generated cDNA from low-input RNA samples and helped with bioinformatics. A.S.C., S.W., C.C., and D.R. assisted with single-cell RNA-Seq analysis. R.C. and J.Y. performed qRT-PCR experiments. M.S. aided in the interpretation of the stromal RNA-Seq data. M.S., T.R.C., D.H. and P.T. performed SHG imaging and analysis. R.N. and A.F. helped with the xenograft experiments. S.O.T. and C.C. independently scored the IHC stains. T.R.C. and J.N.S. designed, performed and analyzed the alginate-bead experiments. M.R.-B., F.R., J.M.T., S.B., R.C. were involved in the acquisition and data analysis and interpretation of the Phase 1 clinical trial GEICAM EDALINE, designed and driven by M.M. F.R. performed the biomarkers analysis of the GEICAM EDALINE clinical trial. D.N.W. designed experiments, provided intellectual input. E.L. and M.M. provided intellectual input into the design and interpretation of clinical dataÂ and assisted in drafting the manuscript. A.S.C., M.N.H. and A.S. wrote the manuscript with input from all authors.</p>
