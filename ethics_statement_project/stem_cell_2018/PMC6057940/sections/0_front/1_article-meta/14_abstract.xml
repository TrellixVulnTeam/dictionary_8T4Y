 <p id="Par2">Stromal cell recruitment, activation and crosstalk with cancer cells is poorly understood. Here, the authors demonstrate that cancer cell-derived Hedgehog ligandÂ  triggers stromal remodeling that in turn induces a cancer-stem-cell like, drug-resistant phenotype of nearby cancer cells while treatment with smoothened inhibitors reverses these phenotypes.</p>
