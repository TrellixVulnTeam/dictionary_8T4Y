 <p id="Par1">The cellular and molecular basis of stromal cell recruitment, activation and crosstalk in carcinomas is poorly understood, limiting the development of targeted anti-stromal therapies. In mouse models of tripleÂ negative breast cancer (TNBC), Hedgehog ligand produced by neoplastic cells reprograms cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to provide a supportive niche for the acquisition of a chemo-resistant, cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype via FGF5 expression and production of fibrillar collagen. Stromal treatment of patient-derived xenografts with smoothened inhibitors (SMOi) downregulates CSC markers expression and sensitizes tumors to docetaxel, leading to markedly improved survival and reduced metastatic burden. In the phase I clinical trial EDALINE, 3 of 12 patients with metastatic TNBC derived clinical benefit from combination therapy with the SMOi Sonidegib and docetaxel chemotherapy, with one patient experiencing a complete response. These studies identify Hedgehog signaling to CAFs as a novel mediator of CSC plasticity and an exciting new therapeutic target in TNBC.</p>
