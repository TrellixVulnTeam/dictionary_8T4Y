<p id="Par30">Downstream analysis of the effect of paracrine Hh signaling revealed moderate to high phospho-FGFR expression, high collagen deposition and fiber linearization in treatment-naive tumor specimens of the two responders with biopsy material available (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). This correlated with elevated phospho-FAK mechano-signaling and ALDH1-positive cells at the tumor−stromal interface (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). In contrast, the non-responder with high paracrine HPAS exhibited weak phospho-FGFR expression, low collagen content and minimal/no evidence of mechano-signaling and breast CSCs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). While the small number of patients warrants caution, these additional tumor factors deserve further investigation in future clinical trials as adjunct biomarkers of therapeutic response for patient selection for anti-SMOi-based combination therapies in Hh-expressing TNBC.
