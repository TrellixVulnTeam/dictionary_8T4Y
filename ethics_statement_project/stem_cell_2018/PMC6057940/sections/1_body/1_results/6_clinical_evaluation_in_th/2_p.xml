<p id="Par29">To assess if stromal Hh pathway activation determines clinical response, we evaluated epithelial HH ligand and stromal GLI1 expression in treatment naïve surgical tissue by immunochemistry. Only ten patient tumor samples were evaluable. Three out of ten tumors had high paracrine Hh Pathway Activation Signature (HPAS), characterized by high epithelial HH in combination with high stromal GLI1 expression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Of these, two patients experienced a clinical response whereas all patients with low HPAS expression had progressive metastatic disease on the prescribed treatment regimen (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). An additional patient experienced clinical benefit, but the status of Hh pathway activation was unknown as her tumor sample was not available for analysis (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).
