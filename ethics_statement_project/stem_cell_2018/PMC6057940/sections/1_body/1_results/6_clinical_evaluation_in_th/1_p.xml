<p id="Par28">The promising preclinical study results led us to establish the EDALINE (GEICAM/2012-12) phase I trial of docetaxel in combination with SMOi (NVP -LDE225, Sonidegib) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of this combined therapy in patients with metastatic TNBC. Twelve patients with prior standard of care chemotherapy treatments with taxanes and/or anthracyclines were enrolled. Detailed information on clinical trial design, patient and treatment characteristics are described in Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and on ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier:

Combination therapy was well-tolerated and the RP2D of Sonidegib 800 mg once daily in combination with Docetaxel 75 mg/m

 </sup> (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria version 1.1. One patient experienced a complete clinical response, defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target tumor lesions and the absence of new tumor lesions. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>, the 54-year-old postmenopausal woman presented with metastatic disease in the lungs (red and blue arrows). Following eight cycles of combined therapy, the patient achieved complete clinical response, evident by the complete resolution of all her lung metastases on routine progress CT scan (Fig.
