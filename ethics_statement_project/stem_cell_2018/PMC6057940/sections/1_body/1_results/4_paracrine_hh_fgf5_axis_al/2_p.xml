<p id="Par22">To test whether the induction of sphere-forming capacity by FGF5 treatment was epigenetically stable or plastic, we tested the impact of addition or removal of FGF5 to primary and secondary sphere cultures. Increased sphere formation in response to FGF5 was observed in secondary cultures regardless of whether those cells were pre-treated with FGF5 during primary cultures (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5b</xref>). Furthermore, removal of recombinant FGF5 decreased secondary sphere formation to levels comparable to those of cells never treated with FGF5 ligand (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5b</xref>). Consistent with this result, treatment of spheres with a small molecule inhibitor of FGFR signaling (NVP-BGJ398) prevented FGF5-mediated tumorsphere formation in primary or secondary cultures (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5c</xref>). These results demonstrate that stromal-derived FGF5 is sufficient to promote reversible transition to a CSC phenotype, rather than through the expansion of a subpopulation of CSC.
