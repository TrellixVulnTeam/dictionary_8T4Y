<p id="Par26">Based on these observations we predicted that SMOi would sensitize tumors to cytotoxic chemotherapy. HCI-002 PDX and MDA-MB-231 xenografts were then treated with SMOi ±  docetaxel (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d–f</xref>). Compared with vehicle treatment, either SMOi or docetaxel monotherapy slowed tumor growth and extended mice survival (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d, f</xref>). However, the most robust and durable therapeutic effect occurred with combined therapy (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d, f</xref>). Interestingly, the proportion of mice with metastatic disease at ethical endpoint (based on primary tumor size) was doubled in the docetaxel treated group, an observation previously made with paclitaxel in TNBC mouse models

 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>). Combination therapy reduced the frequency of mice with metastatic disease to below that seen in the vehicle control group, despite these mice being alive much longer compared to those in the other treatment groups. Similar therapeutic benefit was observed in MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice treated with combination therapy in terms of tumor growth, overall survival, and histological changes (Supplementary Fig.
