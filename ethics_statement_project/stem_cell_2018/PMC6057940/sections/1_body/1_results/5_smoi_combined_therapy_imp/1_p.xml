<p id="Par24">To directly test these findings in more clinically relevant models, we turned our analysis to xenograft models of human TNBC. All three patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models tested were Hh ligand-positive as was the MDA-MB-231 cell line model (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a</xref>). We found convincing evidence of exclusive stromal-restricted Hh signaling and sensitivity to SMOi, using species-specific RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6b, c</xref>). In addition, in vitro treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with SMOi did not alter Hh target gene expression or proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6d, e</xref>), consistent with the absence of SMO expression by these cells. The HCI-002 and MDA-MB-231 models were used for further studies, as they are well-accepted models of TNBC
