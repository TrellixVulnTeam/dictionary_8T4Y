<p id="Par27">We then examined the impact of stromal Hh pathway inhibition on the histology of the tumor epithelial and stromal compartments. The proportion and number of stromal cells in the HCI-002 PDX model were unaffected by long-term SMOi and/or chemotherapy treatments (data not shown). SMOi had no inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human cancer cells across a range of doses (Supplementary Fig.
