<p id="Par25">Analyses of the ECM in HCI-002 xenografts by SHG and picrosirius red staining revealed abundant fibrillar collagen exclusively at the tumor−stromal interface (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a, b</xref>). The collagen fibers were highly linearized and densely packed as depicted by orientation and GLCM analyses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Areas of high fibrillar collagen density were also associated with concomitant FAK phosphorylation and expression of the human CSC marker ALDH1 in the epithelial compartment, as highlighted by co-staining experiments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). As observed in the transgenic model, collagen density and orientation, FAK phosphorylation and CSC marker expression were reduced following SMO inhibition (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a–c</xref>).
