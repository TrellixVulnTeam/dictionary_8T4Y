<p id="Par12">RNA-Seq analysis of the stromal fraction revealed 185 genes that were differentially expressed (&gt;2-fold, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), with 146 upregulated and 39 downregulated genes in the stroma of M6-Hh tumors compared to M6-Ctrl and M6-Hh tumor + SMOi (Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>). A number of genes were markedly upregulated by Hh signaling, in particular the growth factor gene 
 <italic>Fgf5</italic> at more than 290-fold, 
 <italic>St8Sia2</italic> (&gt;40-fold) and 
 <italic>Tspan11</italic> (&gt;4-fold; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The large majority of gene expression changes in Hh-activated stroma returned to baseline following treatment with SMOi (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>), suggesting that the stromal transcriptional changes are SMO-dependent and reversible.
