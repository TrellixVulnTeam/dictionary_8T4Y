<p id="Par7">To investigate the mechanistic basis for Hh-dependent tumor growth and metastasis in TNBC, we used the murine M6 allograft model of low grade TNBC, in which transgenic Hh expression drives invasion, metastasis, and high-grade morphology

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>b–d). M6-Ctrl and M6-Hh monoculture cell viability were similar between vehicle and SMOi treatment and the expression of canonical Hh target genes
