<p id="Par8">To examine the transcriptional changes induced by Hh pathway activation in detail, we dissociated and analyzed freshly flow cytometry-sorted stromal and epithelial fractions of M6-Ctrl and M6-Hh tumors ± SMOi using RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Differential gene expression analysis confirmed effective cellular fractionation, with Hh transgene expression restricted to the epithelial cell population while Hh target genes 
 <italic>Ptch</italic>, 
 <italic>Gli1</italic>, and 
 <italic>Hhip</italic> expression were induced solely in the stromal fraction of M6-Hh tumors (Supplementary Data
