<p id="Par10">Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene ontology (GO) analysis of the purified epithelial fraction highlighted enrichment for genes specifically and almost exclusively associated with mammary stemness and invasion, consistent with the morphologically undifferentiated phenotype previously observed in Hh-overexpressing tumors

 </sup> were used to quantitate the impact of Hh signaling on tumor-initiating capacity. M6-Ctrl and M6-Hh tumor cells were isolated by FACS and transplanted at various dilutions. M6-Hh cells had significantly higher tumor-initiating capacity (1 in 435) compared with M6-Ctrl cells (1 in 1088; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref>). Importantly, the proliferation and expression of CSC markers were indistinguishable between M6-Ctrl and M6-Hh cells in monoculture, indicating that Hh expression in M6 cells does not regulate CSC properties in a cell-autonomous manner (Supplementary Fig.
