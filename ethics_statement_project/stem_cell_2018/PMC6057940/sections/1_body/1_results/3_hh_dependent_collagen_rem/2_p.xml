<p id="Par19">Sites of collagen deposition and crosslinking at the stromal−epithelial interface were also associated with increased epithelial phosphorylation and activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a key signaling intermediate downstream of integrin receptors (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a</xref>). E-cadherin was used to mark the epithelial compartment (Fig.

Importantly, mechano-signaling and cancer stemness occurred primarily in dense collagen regions and were not observed in the core of M6-Hh tumors (Supplementary Fig.
