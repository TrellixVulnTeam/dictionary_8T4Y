<p id="Par20">To directly assess the sufficiency of collagen mechano-signaling to promote stemness, the clonogenic potential of M6-Ctrl and M6-Hh cells was assessed using three-dimensional cultures encapsulated within Alginate-Collagen I Inter-Penetrating Network (IPN) hydrogels. Alginates are widely used in bioengineering approaches as scaffolds

 </sup>. In our experiments, biomechanical properties were precisely controlled through regulation of alginate gelation. The enrichment for fibrillar collagen in this in vitro model allowed the uncoupling of 3D environmental biomechanics from biochemistry, recapitulating the features of stromal collagen matrix deposition observed in Hh-expressing models. Increased content and presence of highly bundled fibrillar collagen significantly increased the clonogenic capacity of M6 cells, a functional surrogate for CSC activity, independently of Hh ligand expression (Fig.
