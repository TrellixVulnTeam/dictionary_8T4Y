<p id="Par67">Low passage M6 cells grown to 70–80% confluency as adherent monolayer were trypsinized, quenched in normal culture media, washed three times with large volumes of calcium-magnesium-free PBS then passed through a 40 μm cell strainer to obtain a single-cell suspension. Cell number was determined using the Countess™ Automated Cell Counter (Invitrogen) then seeded in sphere-promoting culture at a density of 2.5×10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/mL in ultra low-adherent six-well plates (Corning
 <sup>®</sup> LifeSciences). Cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. Primary sphere formation efficiency was determined after 5 days. Spheres larger than 40 μm were counted manually using a light microscope and automatically using the IncuCyte ZOOM
 <sup>®</sup> Live Cell System (Essen BioScience). Primary spheres were then collected by gentle centrifugation and washed with calcium-magnesium-free PBS prior to dissociation into single-cell suspension. Cell number was determined as above then seeded in triplicate at a density of 5×10
 <sup>2</sup> cells/mL in ultra low-adherent six-well plates. Secondary sphere formation efficiency was determined after 8 days. Sphere media was composed of DMEM/F12, 1% methylcellulose, 1× B27 supplement (17504-044, Invitrogen), and 4 μg/mL sodium heparin (H3149-50KU, Sigma-Aldrich). Tumorspheres were treated with 150 ng/mL recombinant FGF5 (237-F5-050, R&amp;D Systems) and/or 500 nM FGFR inhibitor, NVP-BGJ 398 (S2183, Selleckchem). Sphere formation efficiency was calculated using the following formula: (Number of tumorspheres larger than 40 μm / Number of single cells seeded) × 100%.
