 </sup>. The human triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was obtained from the American Type Cell Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco
 <sup>®</sup>). All cell lines were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. Each cell line was characterized by short tandem repeat analysis profiling using the PowerPlexR 18D System (Promega) and tested for mycoplasma contamination (MycoAlert
 <sup>TM</sup> Mycoplasma Detection kit, Lonza). SMOi GDC-0449 (S1082, Selleckchem) and NVP-LDE225 (Novartis, Australia) were dissolved in DMSO to stock concentration of 10 mM. Docetaxel chemotherapy (McBeath, Australia) was diluted fresh (0.1 nM to 10 μM) with cell culture media. Recombinant FGF-5 (237-F5-050, R&amp;D) was reconstituted at 10 μg/mL in PBS containing 1 μg/mL sodium heparin (H3149-50KU, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (A9418-10G, Sigma-Aldrich). NVP-BGJ 398, a potent and selective FGFR inhibitor (S2183, Selleckchem) was used at a concentration of 500 nM. All cell culture experiments involving SMOi (1 nM to 10 μM), NVP-BGJ 398 and chemotherapy (IC30) lasted 5 days and were performed in the presence of FBS. For cell viability assays, treatment of M6 cells with recombinant FGF-5 (150 ng/mL) in the absence of FBS lasted 5 days. Cell viability assays were carried out in 96-well plates (Corning
 <sup>®</sup> Life Sciences) and were determined by alamarBlue
 <sup>®</sup> reduction.
