<p id="Par45">Primary M6 cells and CAFs derived from M6-Ctrl and M6-Hh tumors, respectively, were selected by FACS using the following cell surface markers: Epithelial cells: CD45
 <sup>−</sup>/CD31
 <sup>−</sup>/CD140a
 <sup>−</sup>/GP38
 <sup>−</sup>/EpCAM
 <sup>+</sup>/GFP
 <sup>+</sup>; CAFs: CD45
 <sup>−</sup>/CD31
 <sup>−</sup>/CD140a
 <sup>+</sup>/GP38
 <sup>+</sup>/EpCAM
 <sup>−</sup>/GFP
 <sup>−</sup>. After tumor dissociation, single cells were pelleted and resuspended in FACS buffer containing the following antibodies: anti-CD45-APC-eFluor
 <sup>®</sup>-780 (1:500; Affymetrix eBioscience, Clone: 30-F11), anti-CD31-biotin (1:100; BD Pharmingen
 <sup>TM</sup>, Clone: 390), anti-CD140a-APC (1:100; BioLegend
 <sup>®</sup>, Clone: APA5), anti-Podoplanin-PE (1: 1,000, BioLegend
 <sup>®</sup>, Clone: 8.1.1) for 20 min on ice. After two washes with PBS, cells were then pelleted and resuspended in FACS buffer containing Brilliant Violet 421™ Streptavidin (1:400; BioLegend®), and incubated for 20 min on ice. Cells were then washed twice in FACS buffer before being resuspended in FACS buffer containing DAPI (Invitrogen) to discriminate dead cells. Different epithelial and CAF populations from at least three tumor specimens per treatment group were isolated and cultured into 100 mm culture dishes (Corning
 <sup>®</sup> LifeSciences) in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 50 μg/mL gentamycin and 1× antibiotic/antimycotic (15-240-096, Gibco
 <sup>®</sup>) in a 5% O
 <sub>2</sub>, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator at 37 °C. 10
 <sup>5</sup> M6 cells were added to the Petri dish when CAFs derived from the corresponding tumors have reached 70% confluency and the coculture assays lasted a total of 5 days.
