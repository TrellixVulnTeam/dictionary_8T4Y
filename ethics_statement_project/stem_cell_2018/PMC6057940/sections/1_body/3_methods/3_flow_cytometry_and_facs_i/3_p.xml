 <sup>®</sup>, Clone: G8.8) for 20 min on ice. Cells were then washed twice in FACS buffer before being resuspended in FACS buffer containing DAPI (1:1000; Invitrogen) to discriminate dead cells. Stromal cells identified as DAPI
 <sup>-</sup>/GFP

 <sup>−</sup>and M6 cancer cells identified as DAPI
 <sup>−</sup>/ GFP
 <sup>+</sup>/EPCAM
 <sup>+</sup> were collected from at least five tumor specimens per treatment group.
