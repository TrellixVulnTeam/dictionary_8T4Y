<p id="Par44">For the analysis of CSC properties, single-cell suspensions from M6 tumor models were incubated with the combination of the following murine lineage markers: anti-CD31-biotin (1:40), anti-CD45
 <sup>-</sup>biotin (1:100), anti-TER119-biotin (1:80), and anti-BP1
 <sup>-</sup>biotin (1:50) for 20 min on ice. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in FACS buffer containing streptavidin-APC-Cy
 <sup>TM</sup>7 (1:400) and the following epithelial stem cell markers: anti-CD24-PE (1:500; BD Pharmingen
 <sup>TM</sup>, Clone: M1/69), anti-CD29-APC-Cy7 (1:100; BioLegend, Clone: HMβ1-1) and anti-CD61-APC (1:50; ThermoFisher), and incubated for 20 min on ice. Cells were then washed twice in FACS buffer before being resuspended in FACS buffer containing DAPI (Invitrogen).
