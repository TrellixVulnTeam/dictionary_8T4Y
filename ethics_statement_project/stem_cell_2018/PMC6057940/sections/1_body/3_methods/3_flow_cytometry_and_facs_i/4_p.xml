<p id="Par43">For the isolation of M6-Ctrl or M6-Hh cells for limiting dilution assays, cells were pelleted and resuspended in FACS buffer containing the following murine lineage markers (Lin
 <sup>+</sup>): anti-CD45-biotin (1:100; BD Pharmingen
 <sup>TM</sup>, Clone: 30-F11); anti-CD31-biotin (1:40; BD Pharmingen
 <sup>TM</sup>, Clone: 390), anti-TER119-biotin (1:80; BD Pharmingen
 <sup>TM</sup>, Clone: TER119), and anti-BP1-biotin (1:50; Affymetrix eBiosciences, Clone: 6C3) for 20 min on ice. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in FACS buffer containing streptavidin-APC-Cy
 <sup>TM</sup>7 (1:400; BD Pharmingen
 <sup>TM</sup>) and anti-EpCAM-PerCp/Cy5.5 (1:500, BioLegend
 <sup>®</sup>, Clone: G8.8), and incubated for 20 min on ice. Cells were then washed twice in FACS buffer before being resuspended in FACS buffer containing DAPI (1:1000; Invitrogen). Live primary M6 neoplastic cells were sorted based on their GFP
 <sup>+</sup>/EpCAM
 <sup>+</sup>/Lin
 <sup>−</sup> expression.
