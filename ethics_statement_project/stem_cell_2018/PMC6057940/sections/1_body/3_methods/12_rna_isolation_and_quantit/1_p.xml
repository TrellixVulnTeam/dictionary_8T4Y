<p id="Par57">Individual stromal CAFs and epithelial malignant M6 cancer cells were FACS-isolated as described above. For each fraction, between 1,000 and 50,000 cells were directly collected into QIAzol lysis reagent. Low-input RNA samples were then isolated using the miRNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen). All the other standard input RNA samples were isolated using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed with the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche Diagnostics). cDNA was synthesized from 0.5 to 2 μg of total RNA and diluted 1:10 before any further quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis.</p>
