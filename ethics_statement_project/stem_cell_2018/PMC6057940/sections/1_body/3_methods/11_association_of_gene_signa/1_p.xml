<p id="Par56">A stringent mouse gene signature was derived through differential expression analysis of the stromal fraction of M6-Hh tumors in comparison to the stroma of M6-Ctrl or M6-Hh tumors treated with SMOi. The stromal mouse gene signature was then converted to human genes using NCBI homolog gene list v68 (

The converted gene list consists of 146 upregulated genes and 39 downregulated genes in the Hh-activated stromal population (Supplementary Data

 </sup>. The gene signature score was defined by a weighted average method for each sample in the TCGA cohort. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan−Meier method, with overall survival used as the outcome metric.
