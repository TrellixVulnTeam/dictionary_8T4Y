 </sup> analysis to characterize the texture of a sample and determine the correlation of the SHG signal within the matrix. The correlation plots represent the similarity in signal strength between pixels. A slower decay shows a more organized and correlated network of collagen fibers than in samples with a faster decay. GLCM analysis was performed in ImageJ.
