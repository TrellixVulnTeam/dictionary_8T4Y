<p id="Par62">Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin and mounted in DPX (Sigma) were imaged using a ×20 1.0 NA objective on an upright fixed-stage two-photon laser scanning microscope system (Zeiss). The excitation source was a Ti:Sapphire femto-second laser cavity (Newport Mai Tai), coupled into an LSM 710 scan module. An excitation wavelength of 890 nm was used to collect SHG signal (435 ± 20 nm) from collagen. Maximum collagen coverage values derived from SHG signal (by depth (line graph) and at peak value (histogram inset)) was used as a measure of collagen abundance and density. Signal was acquired from three separate areas measuring 320 × 320 μm
 <sup>2</sup> across each sample. Bright-field transmission images were co-acquired with SHG data.
