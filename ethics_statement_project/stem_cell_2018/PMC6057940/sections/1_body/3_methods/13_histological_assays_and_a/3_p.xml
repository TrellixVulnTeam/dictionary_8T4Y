<p id="Par61">For immunofluorescence staining, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections on Superfrost+ glass slides (Thermo) were dewaxed and rehydrated, and antigen retrieval was performed by boiling for 12 min in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 9.0) in a pressure cooker (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Following blocking with 10% goat serum, sections were incubated with the primary antibodies p(Tyr397)-FAK, CK6, ALDH1, E-cadherin at 4 °C for 18 h, washed in PBS and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h. After washing in PBS, sections were incubated with 0.2 µg/mL DAPI in PBS for 5 min to label nuclei and mounted. Confocal fluorescence images were captured using an LSM 700 confocal scanning system (Carl Zeiss AV), with Zen 2011 (Black Edition) version 8.1.5.484 software. Images were processed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda MD, USA) as previously described
