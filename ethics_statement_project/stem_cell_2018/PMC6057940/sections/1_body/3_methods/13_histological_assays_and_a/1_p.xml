<p id="Par59">Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin at 4 °C overnight then processed for paraffin embedding. For histological analysis, 4 μm tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin using standard methods. Immunohistochemical, immunofluorescence, and picrosirius red staining were performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections using standard protocols. Full details of each antibody used and their relative staining protocols for immunochemistry are described in Supplementary Table
