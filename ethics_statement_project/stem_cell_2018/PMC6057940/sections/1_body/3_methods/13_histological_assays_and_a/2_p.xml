<p id="Par60">Histological analysis of the proliferative marker phospho-histone H3, ALDH-1, and the progenitor cell marker CK6 were carried out by digitizing entire images using the Aperio CS2 digital pathology slide scanner (Leica Biosystem) at ×20 magnification. Cells that stained positively for phospho-Histone H3, ALDH-1, or CK6 within a distance of 200 μm from CAFs at the tumor−stromal interface were then counted and averaged over at least five fields using the Aperio Imagescope software (Leica Biosystem). The limit of 200 μm reflects the well-established diffusional distance for Hh ligand in mammalian models

 </sup>. Two specialist breast pathologists, who were blinded to the experiment treatment groups, independently scored the remaining IHC stains. Areas of necrosis were excluded for all analyses. The number of CD45
 <sup>+</sup> cells in the peritumoral stroma and the number of CD31
 <sup>+</sup> blood vessels were estimated and averaged over five high power fields (×40 magnification). Alpha-SMA was scored as the percentage of myofibroblabts in the tumor stroma at the whole tumor level. Tumor vs. stromal ratio was estimated on H&amp;E sections.
