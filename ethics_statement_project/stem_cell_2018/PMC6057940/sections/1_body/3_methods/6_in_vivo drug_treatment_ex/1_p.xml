<p id="Par49">SMOi GDC-0449 (S1082, Selleckchem) and NVP-LDE225 (Novartis, Australia) were dissolved in 0.5% methylcellulose, 0.2% Tween
 <sup>®</sup> 80 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.5% methylcellulose, 0.5% Tween
 <sup>®</sup> 80, respectively, and then delivered by oral gavage (100 mg/kg/bid, GDC-0449; 80 mg/kg/day, NVP-LDE225). Chemotherapy (Docetaxel, McBeath Australia) was diluted in 5% dextrose then delivered by intraperitoneal injection (15 mg/kg/week). Tumor-bearing mice were randomly assigned into respective treatment groups once tumor volume reached 100 mm
 <sup>3</sup> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7–8 mice per group). Tumor growth was calculated for each individual tumor by normalizing to the tumor volume at day 0. In short-term studies examining the molecular and histological impact of Hh pathway activation and inhibition, mice were treated between 8 and 14 days then euthanized. At euthanasia, primary tumors were harvested and macroscopic metastatic lesions were scored. For the long-term therapeutic study, mice were treated to endpoint. Animals were excluded from overall survival analysis if they had to be sacrificed for poor body conditioning, unrelated to tumor size endpoint. Animal technicians, who were blinded to the experiment treatment groups, independently monitored the mice.
