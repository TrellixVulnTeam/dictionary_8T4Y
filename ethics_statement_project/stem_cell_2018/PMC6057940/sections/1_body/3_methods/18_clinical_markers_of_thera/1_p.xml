<p id="Par69">The expression of Hedgehog ligand (HH) and GLI1 were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) from archived FFPE pretreatment primary breast tumors from patients enrolled in the EDALINE clinical trial. Pathologists, who were blinded to clinical parameters, carried out biomarker analysis. Two specialist breast pathologists independently calculated the Histo-score (Hscore) based on the percentage of stained cells (HH and GLI1 expression) and staining intensity on a predetermined scale (0: no staining to 3: strong), in the tumor epithelial cells (HH) and the tumor stroma (GLI1). Predefined cut-offs for high/low biomarker expression were established based on standard criteria (median Hscore for HH in tumor cells and intensity staining for GLI1 in the stroma).</p>
