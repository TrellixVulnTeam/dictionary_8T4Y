<p id="Par51">Analysis of the RNA-Sequencing data was conducted on the high-performance computing cluster at the Garvan Institute following a standard four-step approach, cleaning, aligning, counting, and differential expression with an additional normalization step. FASTQ files were quality checked using FastQC version 0.11.1 (

Filtered reads were then aligned to the mouse reference genome GRCm38/mm10 using STAR, version 2.4.0d . Feature counting was performed using HTSeq version 0.5.4p3 . Due to high levels of variation in the expression data between replicates, the RUV normalization procedure was implemented

 </sup>. This aims to remove unwanted variation and produce more reliable pair-wise comparisons when calculating differential expression. In this instance, RUVr with a K of 3 was found to be the most effective method based on the suggested diagnostics, e.g. plots of
