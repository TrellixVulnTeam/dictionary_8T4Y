<p id="Par66">Alginate-Collagen I Inter-Penetrating Network (IPNs) hydrogels were generated from 1% sodium alginate mixed with either 20, 5 or 0% rat tail collagen I, plus 1% Matrigel. A standard guide describing cell encapsulation in alginate is available from ASTM International (ASTM F2315–11). Well-characterized alginates with high purity and G-block composition were used to prepare hydrogels with consistent mechanical properties for cell encapsulation. M6-Ctrl and M6-Hh single cells were encapsulated in 400 μm diameter beads before transferring to normal growth media. Colony-forming ability was assessed at days 5, 8, and 12.</p>
