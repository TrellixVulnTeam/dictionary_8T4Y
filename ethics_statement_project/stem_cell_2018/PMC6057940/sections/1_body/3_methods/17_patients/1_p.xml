<p id="Par68">Patients in this study were enrolled in the GEICAM/2012-12 (EDALINE) clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02027376); a single-arm, open-label, phase I, 3 + 3 dose escalation study in which patients with TNBC were treated with the SMOi Sonidegib (LDE-225) in combination with docetaxel to determine the MTD and the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), as the primary objective. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and documented before performing any protocol-specific procedure. The study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines (ICH GCP), the Declaration of Helsinki and applicable local regulatory requirements and laws. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board and the Ethics Committee of all the participating sites (Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Hospital Universitario Clínico San Carlos, Complejo Hospitalario Universitario A Coruña, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocío, Hospital Universitario Virgen de la Victoria), according to the requirements of the Spanish regulations (GEICAM/2012-12; clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02027376). Eligible patients, with no more than three previous lines of chemotherapy for metastatic disease were treated with 21-day cycles of intravenous docetaxel 75 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> on day 1 and oral Sonidegib administered at increasing doses of 400, 600, and 800 mg once daily (QD), until radiographic or symptomatic progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of the informed consent, whichever occurred first. All patients at each dose level completed at least two treatment cycles before being enrolled to the next Sonidegib dose level. Twelve patients were enrolled into the study and were treated as described above.
