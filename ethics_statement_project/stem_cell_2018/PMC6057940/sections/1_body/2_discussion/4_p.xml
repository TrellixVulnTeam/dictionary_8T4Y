<p id="Par34">Which effects of CAFs on cancer stemness are mediated by direct cell−cell interactions, and which by secreted factors are still unknown. Moreover, how FGFR activation and high FAK mechano-signaling lead to the establishment of a stem-like phenotype remains to be determined, but they are associated in vitro and in vivo with upregulation of transcription factors previously implicated in mammary physiological and CSCs, including ID3 and SOX10
