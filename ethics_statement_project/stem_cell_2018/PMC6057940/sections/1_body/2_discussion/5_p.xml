<p id="Par35">Importantly, many elements of Hh paracrine signaling to CAFs are active during embryonic development in mammals, though have not previously been linked. Dhh is highly expressed in a subset of epithelial cells of the mammary end bud, an invasive and proliferative structure responsible for ductal elongation in the developing mouse mammary gland

 </sup>. Consistent with our observation in TNBC, stromal but not epithelial Hh signaling is required for appropriate ductal morphogenesis

 </sup>. A number of FGF ligands are secreted by mammary stromal cells, and activation of epithelial FGFR1/2 is required for mammary ductal elongation and stem cell activity

 </sup>. In addition, mammary stromal fibroblasts secrete and remodel ECM components including collagens

 </sup>. Similar to our results in neoplastic cells, increased collagen density and mechano-signaling via FAK is sufficient to inhibit mammary epithelial cell differentiation and increased clonogenic potential

 </sup>. Thus the paracrine Hh signaling we observe in TNBC most likely represents the dysregulation and chronic activation of a process that is important for normal mammary ductal morphogenesis.
