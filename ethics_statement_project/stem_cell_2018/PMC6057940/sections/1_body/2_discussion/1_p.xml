 </sup>. In support of this notion, we now demonstrate that stromal cues from Hh-activated CAFs, including FGF and fibrillar collagen-rich ECM, are capable of inducing and maintain a stem-like phenotype in TNBC cells in vivo. By combining a murine gain-of-function model, small molecule inhibitor studies in human xenografts with powerful in vitro systems, we have demonstrated the plastic characteristics of breast CSCs that can be successfully targeted using anti-stromal therapies, reducing metastatic growth and sensitizing to taxane chemotherapy.
