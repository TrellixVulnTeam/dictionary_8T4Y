<p id="Par37">The benefit from therapeutic targeting of CAFs is twofold. Firstly, we and others have provided evidence for the crucial role of CAFs in supporting CSC self-renewal and resistance to chemotherapy

 </sup>. Therefore, targeting the CAF population and the subsequent abolition of the CAF−neoplastic cell interaction represent a practical strategy to improve cancer outcomes. Secondly, unlike neoplastic cells, CAFs have not been reported to exhibit genomic instability and are therefore less likely to acquire resistance to therapy over time, making them good targets for combination cancer therapies. Combined therapy with SMOi + docetaxel was well-tolerated by mice and humans, and effective in treating a proportion of women with metastatic disease who had previously failed on taxane chemotherapy, including one patient who experienced a complete response. While patient numbers are small, these remarkable results provide the first evidence to our knowledge for clinical benefit from a CAF-directed therapy. Treatment response in patients correlated with high levels of paracrine Hh signaling, FGFR activation and fibrillar collagen deposition, suggesting that the mechanism of action in patients may be consistent with that in mouse models. Hh, FGFR or collagen pathway activation may have value as predictive biomarkers of response to SMOi. Thirty percent of TNBCs show evidence of paracrine Hh pathway activity; SMO inhibitors could then represent therapeutics of interest for a significant number of women. Whilst phase I clinical trials are not designed nor powered to assess therapeutic efficacy, these data suggest an exciting new therapeutic strategy for drug-resistant or metastatic TNBC which should proceed to prospective assessment through Phase II clinical trials.
