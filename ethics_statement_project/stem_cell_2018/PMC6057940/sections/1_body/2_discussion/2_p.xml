 </sup>. However, the impact of ECM collagen content and matrix mechanical properties on the biology of CSCs is not well defined. Our work provides new mechanistic insights, demonstrating that increased collagen density and fiber linearity at the tumorâˆ’stroma interface are associated with FAK activation and increased CSC number, dependent upon Hh paracrine signaling. Notably, we report a relationship between collagen abundance and clonogenicity in vitro and in vivo. Suppressing collagen production using SMO inhibitors was associated with decreased CK6
 <sup>+</sup> and ALDH1
 <sup>+</sup> CSCs, respectively, in both murine and human models of TNBC. Interestingly, recent data links mammographic fibrillar collagen density to breast cancer risk, raising the possibility that breast cancer progenitors in these patients may have expanded in response to a dense collagen matrix

 </sup>. The precise mechanism controlling fibrillar collagen ECM remodeling in Hh-expressing tumors remains undetermined. Further mechanistic investigations are needed to determine if Hh induces the fibrillar collagen program in CAFs through direct regulation of collagen gene promoters via Gli1 or indirect interaction with other transcription factors, as shown in bone formation
