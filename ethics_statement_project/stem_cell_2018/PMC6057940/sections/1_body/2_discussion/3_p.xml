 </sup>. In metastatic breast cancer, resistance to anticancer treatment is primarily due to FGFR gene amplification

 </sup>. Here, we demonstrate a novel ligand-driven mechanism by which FGFR activation mediates both breast cancer stemness and chemoresistance, downstream of activation of the Hh signaling pathway. Importantly, our findings suggest that CAF targeting using small molecule inhibitors of SMO is sufficient to prevent FGF ligand signaling and may overcome resistance to chemotherapies. Interestingly, FGF5 has been reported to be upregulated in prostate CAFs relative to normal fibroblasts

 </sup>, where it is also a target of Hh-Gli signaling. Thus this axis may be operational, and of therapeutic value, in tumor types beyond TNBC.
