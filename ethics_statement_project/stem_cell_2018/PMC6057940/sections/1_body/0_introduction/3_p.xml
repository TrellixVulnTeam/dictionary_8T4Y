<p id="Par5">Neoplastic cells co-opt components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) to further their progression. The TME is a complex ecosystem comprising a myriad of neoplastic and nonmalignant cells embedded in a glycoprotein-rich extracellular matrix (ECM). Prominent cell types include the endothelium, cells of the immune system and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). In addition to its role as a physical scaffold to support tissue architecture, the ECM also functions as a signal transducer between the different TME cell types

 </sup>. The stiffness of the ECM and the abundance of fibrillar collagen immediately adjacent to epithelial lesions provide mechanical signals that facilitate tumor development and progression

 </sup>. Not surprisingly, the TME has emerged as a major determinant of cancer phenotype. In breast cancer, stromal metagenes, in particular those associated with ECM remodeling, strongly predict prognosis and response to chemotherapy
