<p id="Par3">Carcinogenesis draws many parallels with developmental biology. During development, dynamic interaction between stromal and epithelial cells drives patterning and function. Cell fate specification occurs through activation of transcriptional cascades in response to extracellular signals from developmental signaling pathways such as Hedgehog (Hh), Wnt, Notch, BMP (bone morphogenetic proteins), and FGF (fibroblast growth factor)

 </sup>. These pathways direct developmental processes either by direct cell-to-cell contact or through secreted diffusible factors (paracrine signaling). They can act individually or in concert with each other. For example, the interaction between Hh and FGF signaling pathways has been shown to mediate tracheal and lung branching morphogenesis
