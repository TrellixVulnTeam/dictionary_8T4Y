<p id="Par34">We hypothesized that there would be a significant difference in 6-month OS between steroid therapy and steroid plus G-CSF therapy in patients with a PR to steroids (82% vs. 90.5%). A two-sided sample size calculation with power of 0.8, significance level of 0.05, and estimated dropout rate of 10% revealed that at least 190 patients should be included in the PR study: 95 patients in the steroid plus placebo group and 95 in the steroid plus G-CSF group.</p>
