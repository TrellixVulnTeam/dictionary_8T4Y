<p id="Par33">The 1-month OS rate in patients with severe AH undergoing steroid therapy has been reported as 80% and that in a control group as 66% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Moreover, the 6-month OS rate of steroid responders has been reported as 85% and that of non-responders as 25% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A previous, large-scale, randomized study compared co-administration of steroid and pentoxifylline with steroid monotherapy. The 6-month survival rate of the complete responders in the steroid monotherapy group was 90.5%, whereas the 6-month survival rate of partial responders was 82% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The 2-month survival rate was 66% in the G-CSF group and 26% in the control group in a previous study conducted in patients with hepatic failure, in whom AH was responsible for approximately 60% of cases of hepatic failure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Additionally, the 2-month survival rate of null responders was 42% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Based on these data, the sample size was estimated using PASS 11.0 software (NCSS, Kaysville, UT, USA).
