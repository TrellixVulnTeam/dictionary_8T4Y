<p id="Par35">We hypothesized that there would be a significant difference in 2-month OS between placebo therapy and G-CSF therapy (42% vs. 66%) for patients with a NR to steroids. A two-sided sample size calculation with power of 0.8, significance level of 0.05, and estimated dropout rate of 10% revealed that at least 78 patients should be included in the NR study: 39 patients in the placebo group and 39 in the G-CSF group.</p>
