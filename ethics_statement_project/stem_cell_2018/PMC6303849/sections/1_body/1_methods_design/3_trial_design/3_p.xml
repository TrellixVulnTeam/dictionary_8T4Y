The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) committee (a hepatologist, an oncologist, a gastroenterologist, and a biostatistician, who do not participate in this trial) will analyze the preliminary safety data according to the NMDP safety assessment criteria. The data from the preliminary study will be unblinded only to the DSMB committee, therefore will be included in the main study results. The trial follows the recommendations for interventional trials guidelines (SPIRIT; see Additional file
