<p id="Par36">The current study is a prospective, double-blind, multicenter (15 centers), randomized, placebo-controlled trial with two parallel subgroups (PR and NR groups) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We will evaluate the PR (Lille score 0.16–0.56) and NR (Lille score ≥ 0.56) by calculating the Lille score after 1 week of steroid therapy in patients who meet the eligibility criteria. Partial responders are expected to have the OS benefits of steroid therapy, thereby, the subjects will be randomly assigned to either the steroid-placebo co-administration group or the steroid-G-CSF co-administration group (1:1). Study subjects in the PR group will be treated with prednisolone 40 mg/day for 28 days followed by dose tapering.
