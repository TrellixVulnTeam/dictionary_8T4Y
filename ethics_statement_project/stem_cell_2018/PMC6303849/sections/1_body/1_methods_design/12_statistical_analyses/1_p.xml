<p id="Par71">Intention-to-treat analysis will be used as the main assessment of efficacy. Per-protocol will be analyzed for the primary efficacy analysis (i.e., OS), as well as to ensure the stability of analytical outcomes. The OS is defined as the period from enrollment to death or the last follow-up date, and will be analyzed using Kaplanâ€“Meier estimates. To test the difference in OS between the G-CSF and control groups, a log-rank test will be used, and the significance level will be 5% (two-sided test).</p>
