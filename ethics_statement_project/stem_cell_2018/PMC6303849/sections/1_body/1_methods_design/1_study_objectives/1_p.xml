<p id="Par32">The aim of this study is to establish proof of concept whether patients with severe AH (MDF score ≥ 32) would benefit from G-CSF rescue therapy. The primary aim is to evaluate whether G-CSF treatment prolongs 6-month overall survival (OS) of patients with a partial response (PR) to steroids and 2-month OS of patients with a null response (NR) to steroids. Partial responders (0.16 &lt; Lille score &lt; 0.56) or null responders (Lille score ≥ 0.56) are identified based on the Lille score after 1 week of corticosteroid treatment (40 mg daily prednisolone dose). The secondary aims are to identify the risk factors in relation to mortality and the predictive factors associated with responses to standard corticosteroid treatment or rescue G-CSF therapy. Pre-allocation and post-allocation risk factors related to mortality include age, sex, the presence of ascites, infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, daily dose of alcohol consumed, the presence and period of abstinence, white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase, albumin, and prothrombin time. The secondary aims include improvements in liver function (Child–Turcotte–Pugh (CTP) score, MELD score, and chronic liver failure sequential organ failure assessment (CLIF-SOFA)( score), changes in the percentage of CD34-positive cells in peripheral blood, and changes in hepatic histological findings.</p>
