<p id="Par39">All study subjects are started on corticosteroid as standard therapy if they have no contraindications to corticosteroid treatment (prednisolone 40 mg daily); partial responders will have their dose reduced after 28 days of administration, whereas null responders will stop the drug after 7 days administration. When oral dosing is not tolerable, 32 mg methylprednisolone will be administered via intravenous injection daily, which is a dosage with equivalent efficacy. G-CSF will be subcutaneously injected at a dosage of 5 μg/kg body weight daily for 5 days from the next day of randomization in the PR and NR groups. Thereafter, it will be administered at the same dosage every 3 days, for a total of 12 times (days of G-CSF administration, day 8–12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, and 33) (Fig.
