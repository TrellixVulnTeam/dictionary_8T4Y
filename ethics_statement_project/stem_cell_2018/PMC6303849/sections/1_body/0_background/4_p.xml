<p id="Par30">To overcome the difficulties of exploring rescue therapies for steroid non-responders, several clinical trials have been conducted to increase the survival rate using granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) in patients with severe AH [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although the standard treatment with corticosteroids may reduce necroinflammation in patients with AH, mortality remains strikingly high [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, if G-CSF treatment facilitates liver regeneration and enhances neutrophil function in patients with severe AH taking corticosteroids [
