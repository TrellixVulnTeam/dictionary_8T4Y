<p id="Par29">Corticosteroids (prednisolone 40 mg/day, 28 days) are the most widely recommended treatment for severe AH. Corticosteroid treatment is indicated for patients with severe AH who are expected to have a very poor prognosis, with a MDF score ≥ 32 points and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score &gt; 21 points or hepatic encephalopathy [
