<p id="Par76">It is essential to develop a new treatment modality to overcome therapeutic refractoriness or resistance and improve survival of patients with severe AH who are refractory to steroid therapy. Some studies have reported that G-CSF stimulates proliferation of hepatocytes in patients with alcoholic AH, cirrhosis, and liver failure, by mobilizing CD34-positive stem cells to the liver [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These studies enrolled a small number of subjects and the follow-up period was only 1â€‰month. However, they suggest G-CSF may be beneficial in improving long-term survival in patients with severe AH. Therefore, we hypothesize that G-CSF treatment might prolong the survival of patients with severe AH who are refractory to corticosteroid treatment. This is the first proof-of-concept trial designed to assess the efficacy of G-CSF according to the response to corticosteroids. This large-scale, multicenter, randomized controlled trial is also designed to find a special subgroup of patients in whom G-CSF effectively works to improve liver function and prolong survival.
