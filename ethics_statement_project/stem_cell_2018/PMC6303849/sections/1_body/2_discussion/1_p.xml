<p id="Par73">The purpose of this trial is to establish proof of concept of the efficacy of G-CSF in patients with histologically confirmed or clinically suspected, severe AH (MDF score ≥ 32). Patients will be screened and enrolled into the PR (Lille score 0.16–0.56) and NR (Lille score ≥ 0.56) groups by calculating the Lille score after 1 week of steroid therapy. Steroid therapy will be discontinued in null responders upon allocation to the NR group. They will be randomly assigned to either the placebo group or the G-CSF group (1:1). Partial responders are expected to have a survival benefit from steroid therapy, thereby the subjects will be randomly assigned to either the steroid-placebo co-administration group or the steroid-G-CSF co-administration group (1:1). Corticosteroids might reduce necroinflammation in the liver, but a high mortality rate is still noted in patients with severe who are AH receiving steroid therapy. Combining G-CSF with corticosteroid treatment might promote liver regeneration and improve neutrophil function, leading to the amelioration of clinical outcomes.</p>
