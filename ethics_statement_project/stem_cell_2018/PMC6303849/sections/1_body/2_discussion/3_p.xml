<p id="Par75">The 6-month survival rate is higher in patients with severe AH who are receiving pentoxifylline than in those treated with placebo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Pentoxifylline can be considered an alternative therapy for patients with severe AH and contraindication to corticosteroid treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. A previous study reported the therapeutic efficiency of pentoxifylline in non-responders switching from corticosteroids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Among the non-responders to corticosteroids, the investigators compared the 2-month survival rate in patients in whom corticosteroids were replaced with pentoxifylline at the early stage with that in those who had continuously taken corticosteroids; however, the 2-month survival rates were 35.5% and 31.0%, respectively (
