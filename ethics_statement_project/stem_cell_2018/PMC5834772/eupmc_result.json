A phase I study was carried out to evaluate the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of E7777 in Japanese patients with relapsed/refractory peripheral and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. E7777 (6, 12, and expanded 9\u00a0\u03bcg/kg/day) was given to 13 patients by i.v. infusion on five consecutive days per 21-day cycle. Dose-limiting toxicities, including increased alanine aminotransferase, hyponatremia (n\u00a0=\u00a02), hypokalemia, lymphopenia, fatigue, hypoalbuminemia, rash, and increased lipase (n\u00a0=\u00a01), were observed in all three patients in the 12\u00a0\u03bcg/kg/day cohort, whereas two of six patients in the 9\u00a0\u03bcg/kg/day cohort showed decreased appetite or fatigue.
