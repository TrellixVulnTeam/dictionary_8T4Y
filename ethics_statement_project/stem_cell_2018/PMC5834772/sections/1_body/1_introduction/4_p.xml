<p>One potential therapeutic agent is E7777, a recombinant cytotoxic fusion protein comprising the enzymatically active portions of the diphtheria toxin fragments A and B, and the receptor‐binding domain of human IL‐2. E7777 shares an amino acid sequence with DD, and is manufactured using similar but modified processes. Despite these similarities, E7777 has improved purity and an increased percentage of active protein monomer species and reduced level of misfolded and/or aggregated protein impurities. Both E7777 and DD directly bind to the IL‐2R expressed on malignant cells and are subsequently taken up by receptor‐mediated endocytosis, where the diphtheria toxin domain is cleaved and translocated to the cytoplasm to catalyze the covalent linkage of ADP‐ribose to elongation factor‐2, thus inhibiting protein synthesis and causing cell death.
