<p>Two phase III studies of DD have been reported in patients with CD25‐positive (CD25 on ≥20% of tumor cells) CTCL who had previously received other therapeutic interventions. In these studies, patients were assigned to receive DD at 9 or 18 μg/kg/day on five consecutive days per 21‐day cycle, and the resulting ORRs were 30% and 44%, respectively. Although the two doses did not differ significantly regarding efficacy and safety, the DD 18 μg/kg/day cohorts showed superior outcomes.

The study showed an ORR of 31%, which suggested that low CD25 expression does not preclude a meaningful clinical response to DD.
