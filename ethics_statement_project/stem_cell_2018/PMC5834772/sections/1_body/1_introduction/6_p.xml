<p>Yet another phase II study evaluated DD 18 μg/kg/day for the treatment of other relapsed/refractory T‐cell NHLs, and yielded ORRs of 62% for CD25‐positive tumors (CD25 on ≥10% of tumor cells) and 45% for CD25‐negative tumors (CD25 on &lt;10% of tumor cells).
 <xref rid="cas13513-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> As noted above, E7777 and DD share the same construction; however, in the former, the purity is improved and the percentage of active protein monomer species is higher. Furthermore, the specific bioactivity of E7777 is 1.5‐2 times higher than that of DD. Accordingly, in this report we describe the results of a phase I study of E7777 in Japanese patients with PTCL and CTCL.
