<p>Peripheral T‐cell lymphoma and CTCL are classified as mature T‐cell neoplasms and as rare and heterogeneous forms of NHL. Of these, PTCL is the most common histological subtype of the T‐cell lymphomas that are usually characterized by an aggressive clinical presentation, frequent relapse, and eventual development of refractory disease.
 <xref rid="cas13513-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> The standard first‐line treatment for PTCL is multi‐agent chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone therapy;

 <xref rid="cas13513-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> Moreover, median overall survival and median progression‐free survival in patients with PTCL after relapse or progression were reported to be 5.5 and 3.1 months, respectively.
 <xref rid="cas13513-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> Cutaneous T‐cell lymphoma is a generally indolent and heterogeneous NHL, and advanced cases generally have a poor prognosis.
