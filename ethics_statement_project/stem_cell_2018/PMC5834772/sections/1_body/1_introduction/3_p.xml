<p>Currently, several agents for relapsed or refractory T‐cell NHLs have been approved by the US FDA: pralatrexate, romidepsin, and belinostat for PTCL, brentuximab vedotin for ALCL, vorinostat and romidepsin for CTCL. However, the ORRs of these agents have remained at approximately 30%, except the highest ORR of 86% of brentuximab vedotin for ALCL.
