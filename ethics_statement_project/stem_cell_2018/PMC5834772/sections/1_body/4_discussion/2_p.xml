<p>In this multicenter, open‐label phase I study of E7777 in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL and CTCL, we determined an MTD and RD of 9 μg/kg/day on five consecutive days per 21‐day cycle. Although this dosage is only half of the previously selected higher RD for DD (18 μg/kg/day),

 <xref rid="cas13513-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> we consider this result reasonable, as E7777 has a higher level of active monomer purity and reduced level of misfolded and/or aggregated protein impurities, compared with DD. However, DLTs such as decreased appetite and fatigue were observed in two of six evaluable patients from 9 μg/kg/day cohort and other common AEs were also observed, suggesting that these events should be carefully monitored and managed during treatment. Previous studies reported capillary leak syndrome (the occurrence of two or more of the following: hypoalbuminemia, edema, and hypotension) rates of 10‐25%.

 <xref rid="cas13513-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> In contrast, we observed grade 3 capillary leak syndrome in only one patient (8%); however, the high rates of hypoalbuminemia (77%) and peripheral edema (39%) suggest the risk of capillary leak syndrome development. These findings suggest the need for appropriate hydration at the time of drug infusion and careful AE management.
