<p>Tumor response was observed in five of 13 subjects (38%), as described in the previous section. We note that the high‐affinity IL‐2 receptor is a heterotrimer comprising the IL‐2 receptor‐α (CD25) and ‐β (CD122) chains and the common γ (CD132) chain. CD122 and CD132 form a heterodimer that binds to IL‐2 with intermediated affinity, whereas a CD25 monomer is known as a low‐affinity IL‐2 receptor. Although E7777 binds to all three forms of the IL‐2 receptor, but only in cells that commonly express high or intermediate affinity receptors, such as mature T‐cells.
 <xref rid="cas13513-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> E7777 can internalize this drug by receptor‐mediated endocytosis through both high affinity (CD25‐positive) and intermediate (CD25‐negative) IL‐2 receptors.
 <xref rid="cas13513-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> Because E7777 exerted antitumor activity even in low CD25‐expressing patients in this study (Table 
 <xref rid="cas13513-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap">4</xref>), its efficacy does not appear to depend on tumor CD25 expression; therefore, expression of the intermediate affinity IL‐2 receptor might be sufficient to induce a tumor response. Further investigation of the relationship between tumor response and tumor CD25 expression will be carried out in a larger cohort of patients treated with E7777 at the RD of 9 μg/kg/day.
