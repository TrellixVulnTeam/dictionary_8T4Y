<p>In conclusion, this was the first phase I study of E7777. Regarding the safety profile, E7777 was well tolerated at the RD determined herein, assuming careful AE management during treatment, and preliminary but clinically meaningful antitumor activity was observed. Subsequent studies of the efficacy and safety of E7777 in patients with PTCL and CTCL are warranted, including investigations of the relationships between tumor response and factors such as the E7777 PK profile/immunogenicity, tumor CD25 expression, and Treg depletion.</p>
