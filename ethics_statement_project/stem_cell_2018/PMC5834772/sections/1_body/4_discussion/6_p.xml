<p>Previously, DD was reported to suppress Tregs and alter immune functions.

 <xref rid="cas13513-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> Naturally occurring Tregs strongly express CD25 and the master transcription factor Forkhead box P3, and have been implicated in the lack of an effective antitumor immune response. CD25‐positive Tregs have been shown to infiltrate CTCLs, and CTCL cells have been reported to show a Treg‐like phenotype, which includes CD25 and CTLA‐4 expression.
