<p>The PK profiles of E7777 (9 μg/kg/day) in this study, and of DD (9 μg/kg/day) in previous reports
 <xref rid="cas13513-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> were similar in cycle 1 and subsequent cycles, including the tendency toward a decreased drug concentration after cycle 1. The decreased concentration of E7777 in later cycles was attributed to the presence of anti‐E7777 antibodies, and might also account for the reduced frequency of AEs in subsequent cycles. Interestingly, all patients who showed tumor responses were positive for antibodies against both E7777 and IL‐2, thus warranting a further investigation of the relationship between tumor response and immunogenicity.
