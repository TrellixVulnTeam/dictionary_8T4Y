<p>Regarding immunogenicity, anti‐E7777 and anti‐IL‐2 antibodies were detected in nine (69%) and eight (62%) of 13 patients, respectively. In this study, the serum E7777 concentration decreased as the anti‐E7777 antibody titer increased (data not shown). However, this decrease in E7777 concentration was not observed in patients with a low anti‐E7777 antibody titer. All patients with tumor response showed positive results for antibodies against both E7777 and IL‐2.</p>
