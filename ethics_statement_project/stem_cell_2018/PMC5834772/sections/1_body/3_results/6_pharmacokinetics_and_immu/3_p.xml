Similar to other large molecules, the distribution volume of E7777 was small, and nearly equal to the plasma volume at 3000 mL/70 kg (43 mL/kg). The total clearance rate, however, was much lower than the hepatic blood flow rate at 1450 mL/min/70 kg (21 mL/min/kg).
 <xref rid="cas13513-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> In other words, the PK characteristics of E7777 indicate a small distribution volume and low clearance.
