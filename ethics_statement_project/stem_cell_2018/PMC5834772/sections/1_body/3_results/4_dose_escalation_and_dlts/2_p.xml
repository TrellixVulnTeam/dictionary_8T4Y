<p>Dose‐limiting toxicities were evaluated during the first cycle, and at that time, the initial cohort (n = 3) received 6 μg/kg/day E7777. As none of the patients experienced DLTs, the dose level was then escalated to 12 μg/kg/day. However, DLTs were observed in all three patients at this dose level: the first patient showed ALT increased, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and lymphopenia; the second showed increased ALT, fatigue, hypoalbuminemia, hyponatremia, and rash; and the third showed increased lipase. This dose level was considered to exceed the MTD, and the 9 μg/kg/day dose level was expanded accordingly. According to the ISC recommendation, the DLT definition was modified to exclude grade 4 lymphopenia, grade 3 hepatic enzyme abnormalities that recovered to grade ≤2 within one cycle, and any other asymptomatic grade 3 clinical abnormal laboratory results that recovered within 7 days. In the 9 μg/kg/day cohort, two of six patients evaluable for DLTs experienced decreased appetite or fatigue, and recovered from these events within 2‐3 weeks after treatment interruption. One patient did not experience DLT, but was regarded as DLT non‐evaluable because of the dose interruption by grade 3 AST/ALT increased on day 5 of cycle 1. According to the protocol, the ISC evaluated the toxicity profiles of all patients and recommended an MTD and RD of 9 μg/kg/day for five consecutive days per 21‐day cycle.</p>
