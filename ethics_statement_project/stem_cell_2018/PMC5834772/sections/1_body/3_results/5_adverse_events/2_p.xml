 <xref rid="cas13513-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap">2</xref> presents an overall summary of treatment‐emergent AEs. The most common respective hematologic toxicities of all grades (≥30%) and ≥grade 3 were lymphopenia (77% and 62%, respectively), thrombocytopenia (62% and 15%), leukocytosis (54% and 0%), anemia (39% and 15%), and neutropenia (31% and 23%). Grade 4 hematologic toxicities included lymphopenia (23%), thrombocytopenia (8%), and neutropenia (8%). The most common respective non‐hematologic toxicities in all grades (≥60%) and ≥grade 3 were increased ALT (92% and 69%, respectively), increased AST (85% and 46%), decreased appetite (85% and 15%), fatigue (85% and 15%), hypoalbuminemia (77% and 15%), and nausea (69% and 0%). Grade 3 capillary leak syndrome was observed in one patient from the 9 μg/kg/day cohort who recovered within 10 days. Three patients in the 9 μg/kg/day cohort reported serious AEs associated with study drug use; one patient experienced increased ALT/AST and fatigue, the second reported a decreased appetite and hypoxia, and the third developed delirium. Additionally, three patients reported AEs leading to study discontinuation: hypersensitivity in one patient from the 6 μg/kg/day cohort, respiratory failure (not related to the study drug) in one patient from the 12 μg/kg/day cohort, and delirium in one patient from the 9 μg/kg/day cohort. No treatment‐related deaths occurred during the study.
