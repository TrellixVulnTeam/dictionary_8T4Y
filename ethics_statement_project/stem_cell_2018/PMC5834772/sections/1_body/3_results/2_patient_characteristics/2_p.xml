<p>Thirteen patients were enrolled in this study and received E7777 dose levels of 6 (n = 3), 9 (n = 7), or 12 μg/kg/day (n = 3). Of these patients, 10 had been diagnosed with PTCL (PTCL‐NOS, n = 4; AITL, n = 3; ALCL‐ALK positive, n = 1; ALCL‐ALK negative, n = 1; enteropathy‐associated T‐cell lymphoma, n = 1) and 3 with CTCL (MF, n = 3). The median age was 64 years (range, 23‐75 years), and the median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 1 (range, 0‐8).
