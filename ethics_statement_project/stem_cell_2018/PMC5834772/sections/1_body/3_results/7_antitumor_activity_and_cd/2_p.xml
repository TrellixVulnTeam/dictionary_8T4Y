<p>Preliminary antitumor activity was observed in five of 13 patients (ORR, 38%; 95% confidence interval, 14‐68), including four of 10 patients with PTCL and one of three patients with CTCL. All responses were partial. The dose levels were as follows: two patients with AITL at 6 μg/kg/day, one patient with MF at 12 μg/kg/day followed by 6 μg/kg/day from cycle 2, and two patients with PTCL‐NOS at 9 μg/kg/day. Nine of 13 patients were evaluable for tumor CD25 expression, resulting in a range of &lt;1% to &gt;90%. The best overall response and CD25 expression status of all patients are listed in Table
