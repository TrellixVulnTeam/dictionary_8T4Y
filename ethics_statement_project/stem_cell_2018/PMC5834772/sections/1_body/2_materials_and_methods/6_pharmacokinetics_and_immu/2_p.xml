<p>Blood samples were taken for PK analysis on days 1 and 5 of cycle 1 and day 1 of cycles 3, 5, and 7. Samples were collected before E7777 treatment, 30 min after the start of treatment, and 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after completing treatment. The lower limit of quantitation was 30 ng/mL. The following PK parameters were calculated by a non‐compartmental approach, using WinNonlin software version 6.2 (Pharsight, Sunnyvale, CA, USA): area under the curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC
 <sub>(0‐inf)</sub>), terminal half‐life (t
 <sub>1/2</sub>), total clearance (CL), and volume of distribution at steady state (
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>ss</sub>). The maximum observed serum concentration (
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>max</sub>) and time to 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> (
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>max</sub>) were directly derived from these data. For immunogenicity assessments, blood samples were collected before treatment on day 1 of each cycle, and used to evaluate the presence of anti‐E7777/anti‐IL‐2 antibodies.
