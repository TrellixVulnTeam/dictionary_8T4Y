<p>This multicenter, open‐label, phase I study of E7777 in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL and CTCL aimed to evaluate the tolerability, safety, PK, immunogenicity and antitumor activity of this agent and to estimate the RD for subsequent studies. E7777 was given by i.v. infusion over a 60‐min period on five consecutive days per 21‐day cycle, with up to eight cycles. The planned dose levels were 6, 12, 15, and 18 μg/kg/day, with evaluation of intermediate dose levels if necessary. All patients received required premedication comprising acetaminophen, antihistamine drugs, anti‐emetic drugs, systemic steroids, and i.v. hydration.</p>
