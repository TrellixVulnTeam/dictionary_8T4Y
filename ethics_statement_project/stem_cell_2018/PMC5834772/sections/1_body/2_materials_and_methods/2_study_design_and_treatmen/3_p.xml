<p>The DLT of E7777 was evaluated during the first cycle, and the MTD was defined as the highest dose at which fewer than two of six patients experienced a DLT. If two patients experienced DLT at a particular dose level, an ISC was consulted to determine whether that dose could be considered the MTD. One dose reduction in the following cycle was allowed if a DLT or similar toxicity event occurred. The RD was comprehensively determined using the MTD and safety data. Furthermore, tumor CD25 expression was explored in this study.</p>
