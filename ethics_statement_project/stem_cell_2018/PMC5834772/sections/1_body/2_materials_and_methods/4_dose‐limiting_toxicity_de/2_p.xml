<p>The following toxicities were regarded as DLTs if they occurred in cycle 1 and were potentially related to the study treatment: (i) grade 4 neutropenia and leukopenia lasting ≥7 days; (ii) grade 4 thrombocytopenia and grade 3 thrombocytopenia requiring platelet transfusion; (iii) other grade 4 hematological toxicities; (iv) grade 3 or 4 non‐hematological toxicities except for grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea controlled by anti‐emetic or antidiarrheal drugs; (v) grade 3 or 4 infusion‐related reactions except the case recovering to ≤grade 2 within 24 h; and (vi) capillary leak syndrome requiring inpatient hospitalization for medical treatment other than fluid replacement. According to the ISC recommendation, the DLT definition was modified after investigating a 12‐μg/kg/day cohort so as to exclude grade 4 lymphopenia, grade 3 hepatic enzyme abnormalities that recovered to grade ≤2, and any other asymptomatic grade 3 clinical abnormal laboratory results that recovered within 7 days.</p>
