<p id="Par51">To determine if healthy horses developed any anti-MSC alloantibodies after intrathecal administration of allogenic ASCs, we performed a crossmatch assay exactly as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In brief, cryopreserved ASCs were thawed, washed, incubated in blocking solution, washed, and incubated with horse sera (ASC recipient serum). After incubation, ASCs were washed and incubated with the secondary antibody (rabbit polyclonal antibody to equine IgG-FITC; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). Cells were washed, resuspended in flow buffer, and analyzed on a flow cytometer (Cytomics FC 500; Beckman Coulter). Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo flow cytometry software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR, USA). Each recipient horse sera was incubated with the ASCs that they received as well as ASCs that they did not receive (irrelevant ASCs) to determine binding specificity. Pre- and post-sera were available for four of the recipient horses.
