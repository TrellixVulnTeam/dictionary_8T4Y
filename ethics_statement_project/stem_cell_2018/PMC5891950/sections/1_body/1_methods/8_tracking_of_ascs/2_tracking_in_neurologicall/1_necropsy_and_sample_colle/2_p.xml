<p id="Par50">To assess for the presence of occult GFP-labeled cells, we performed additional immunofluorescence assays using a rabbit-anti-GFP primary antibody (clone D5.1; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), visualized using an Alexa594-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Leica Biosystems Inc.). Sections from three horses were imaged on both the GFP and 594 (red) channels.</p>
