<p id="Par49">A full nervous system necropsy was performed 15 days (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2) and 7 days (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1) after ASC injection. Tissue sections were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 3 days (PFA changed daily). Following fixation, samples were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose and then sectioned for routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) tissue processing and frozen sections. In brief, each spinal cord segment was sampled for two H&amp;E cross-sections and three frozen cross-sections in an alternating pattern (frozen–H&amp;E–frozen–H&amp;E–frozen), followed by an approximate 1-cm longitudinal section for frozen. Approximately 150 frozen sections were evaluated for each horse. Routine H&amp;E sections were processed for regular histology and stained on an autostainer (Leica Biosystems Inc., IL, USA). Frozen sections were cut on a cryotome (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 10 μm thickness and stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) at 2 μg/mL for 5 min at room temperature prior to mounting. Sections of the nervous system (brain and spinal cord) were imaged on an Evos FL inverted epifluorescence scope (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to detect bioluminescent ASCs.
