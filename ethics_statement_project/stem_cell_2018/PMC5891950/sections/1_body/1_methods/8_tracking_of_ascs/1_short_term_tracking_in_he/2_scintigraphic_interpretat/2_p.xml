<p id="Par48">ASCs were transfected with a retrovirus GFP-bioluminescence construct prior to injection exactly as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Equine MSCs are readily transfected with this viral vector [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Intrathecal injection was performed in horses under general anesthesia and 100 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> labeled ASCs suspended in saline solution was injected into the AO space.
