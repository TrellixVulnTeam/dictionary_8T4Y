<p id="Par47">The presence and distribution of the radioactive signal was assessed subjectively by a board-certified radiologist using the radioactive markers for anatomical localization based on correlation with the radiographs. The persistence at the injection site was quantified over time. A region of interest (ROI) was drawn using the free-hand ROI tool of the DICOM viewer software (Osirix Foundation, Geneva, Switzerland). Persistence was defined as the ratio of detected counts corrected for decay in the ROI at each time point divided by the number of counts initially present in the ROI.</p>
