<p id="Par46">Images were acquired using a gamma camera (IS2 medical Systems, Ottawa, Canada) with a low-energy all-purpose collimator set at 140 keV photoelectric peak and 20% symmetrical window. Lateral images of the spine from the head to the sacrum were obtained using a 1-min static acquisition immediately postinjection and at 30 min, 1 h, 5 h, and 24 h after injection. Small radioactive markers were placed as landmarks for scintigraphic acquisition. Radiographs (Eklin EDR-6, Sound-Eklin, Carlsbad, CA, USA) of the vertebral column from the head to the sacrum were obtained the day after scintigraphy with radiopaque markers in a similar location to the radioactive markers.</p>
