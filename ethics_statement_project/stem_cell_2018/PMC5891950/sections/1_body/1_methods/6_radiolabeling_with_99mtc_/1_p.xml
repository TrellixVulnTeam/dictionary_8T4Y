<p id="Par43">ASCs were labeled with 20 mCi of 
 <sup>99m</sup>Tc-HMPAO as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] with minor modifications as follows. ASCs were resuspended in a small volume of media with 10% FBS (∼ 0.5 mL). HMPAO (reconstituted in saline) was added to the 
 <sup>99m</sup>Tc and incubated for 5 min. Cells were added to make a final concentration of 125 μg/mL HMPAO, 20 mCi
 <sup>99m</sup> Tc for cell loading (22 mins). After cell loading, ASCs were washed twice with saline (first wash contained 5% autologous serum), and resuspended in sterile saline. Labeled cells were injected at a concentration of 100 million cells in 5 mL. An aliquot of cells was used to determine viability and label persistence. Labeling efficiency and label persistence at 6 h were assessed as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Cell viability at 6 h was assessed on a sample of ASCs using the trypan blue exclusion test. For the control injection (no ASCs), HMPAO was combined with 
 <sup>99m</sup>Tc (125μg HMPAO + 10 mCi Tc for 5 min) and then 5 mCi 
 <sup>99m</sup>Tc-HMPAO was diluted to 5 mL with saline for injection.
