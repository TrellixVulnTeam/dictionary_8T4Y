<p id="Par40">CSF was collected per routine protocol utilizing published anatomical landmarks from the AO or LS space prior to ASC injection and at 30Â days postinjection. The CSF was submitted for complete cytological analysis at the William R. Pritchard Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital (VMTH), UC Davis. Due to the observed and reported seroprevalence in our area [

 <italic>Sarcocystis neurona</italic> and 
 <italic>Neospora hughesi</italic>, the causative agents of EPM, was preformed concurrently on serum and CSF. If antibodies were present in serum and/or CSF, serum to CSF IFAT antibody titer ratios were calculated to further determine the likelihood of EPM infection in horses with neurologic disease [
