<p id="Par41">ASCs (passage (P)2–P4) were used for injections into healthy and neurologically diseased horses. These cells were obtained from the UC Davis VMTH Regenerative Medicine Laboratory (RML). These samples were originally submitted for MSC expansion for autologous patient treatment. Excess cells not used for treatment were donated for research purposes with written consent of the owner. Cryopreserved MSCs were thawed, washed, and expanded in culture exactly as previously described [

Equine MSCs were tested for purity and identity using CD44 (clone CVS18; AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC, USA), CD29 (clone 4B4LDC9LDH8; Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), F6B (white blood cell label; gift of Dr. Jeffrey Stott, UC Davis), CD90 (clone DH24A; VMRD, Pullman, WA, USA), MHC I (clone CVS22; AbD Serotec), and MHC II (clone CVS20; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) (Additional file

Prior to administration they were enumerated and confirmed to be viable (trypan blue), sterile (bacterial culture), and negative for endotoxin (PYROGENT Plus LAL Gel Clot Assay; Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) and mycoplasma (MycoScope PCR Kit; Genlantis, San Diego, CA, USA).
