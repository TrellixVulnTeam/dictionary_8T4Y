<p id="Par38">For healthy horses, three horses were randomly assigned to receive ASCs via AO injection and three horses to receive ASCs via LS injection. One horse from each group received ASCs radiolabeled with 
 <sup>99m</sup>technetium-hexamethyl-propylene-amine-oxyme (
 <sup>99m</sup>Tc-HMPAO; AnazaoHealth, Tampa, FL, USA) for cell tracking studies. A control AO injection of 
 <sup>99m</sup>Tc-HMPAO without ASCs was performed in one horse. Blood (jugular venipuncture) and CSF were collected prior to and after ASC injection (day 0 and day 30, end of study). Complete neurological clinical examinations were performed prior to ASC injection and once a day for 30Â days (the end of the study).
