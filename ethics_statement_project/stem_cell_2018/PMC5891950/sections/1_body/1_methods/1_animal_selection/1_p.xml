<p id="Par35">For healthy horses, six clinically healthy adult mares of Thoroughbred (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2), Quarter Horse (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2), and Warmblood (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2) breeds from the Center of Equine Health (CEH), UC Davis, USA, were selected for the study. The ages of the mares ranged from 6 to 21 years (mean 12 years). All mares were determined to be healthy based on a normal physical and neurological examination, and by a complete cell blood count and serum biochemical profile.
