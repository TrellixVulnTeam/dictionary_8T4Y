<p id="Par52">An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was adapted to detect antibodies directed against the primary bovine protein in FBS, bovine serum albumin (BSA) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. This ELISA was performed as previously described to determine if the intrathecal administration of ASCs cultured in FBS resulted in increased anti-BSA titers in healthy horses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Serum samples collected prior to ASC administration and at 30 days and 14 months following ASC administration were available from four of the horses. The fold-increase in color relative to the negative control was determined for each sample.
