<p id="Par73">Based on our study, atlanto-occipital centesis is the preferred route of administration to facilitate getting the highest concentration of MSCs to the cervical area. Given that both routes are safe, determining the best site for ASC transplantation should take into account the safety of the horse (for example, general anesthesia) and lesion location [
