<p id="Par75">The concern about the presence of the free label was the justification for performing a control injection. The similar distribution of the labeled ASCs and the free label suggest that both are distributing following the CSF flow which is mainly unidirectional from cranial to caudal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The lower initial persistence of the free label can be explained by a faster distribution or higher systemic absorption that can be explained by the smaller size of the label compared with the ASCs. The higher persistence at 24Â h with free label might be explained by fixation of some of the label in local cells. The uptake in the thyroid region observed with the control injection confirms systemic distribution of the free label and absorption of free technetium by the thyroid gland.
