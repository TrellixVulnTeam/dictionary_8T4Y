<p id="Par68">Data from this exploratory study suggest that the intrathecal administration of relatively high doses of allogeneic, culture-expanded ASCs is well tolerated in healthy horses regardless of whether the cells are administered at the AO or LS space. In addition, ASCs after AO injection appear to distribute more efficiently through the subarachnoid space. Another study in horses also showed the safety of intrathecal transplantation through the AO space of bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) with a much lower cell dose (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> BM-MSCs) [
