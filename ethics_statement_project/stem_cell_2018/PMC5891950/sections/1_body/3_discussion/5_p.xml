<p id="Par71">There is no consensus on the best route to deliver MSCs to the neurological system [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], intranasal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], direct lesional, and intracerebral [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] injections. Theoretically, intrathecal injection could be more effective since relatively large MSCs would not have to pass the blood–brain barrier. In support of this, several studies have reported beneficial effects in mice and humans after intrathecal MSC administration for CNS diseases [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. However, at least one serious adverse event (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) has been reported after intrathecal BM-MSC administration in a human [
