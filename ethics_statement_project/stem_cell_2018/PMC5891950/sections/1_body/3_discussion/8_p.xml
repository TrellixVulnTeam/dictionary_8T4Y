<p id="Par74">The relatively low persistence at 24 h also observed with the LS injection despite the lack of demonstrated local migration is similar to the persistence that has been reported with local intralesional injection of MSCs in the equine superficial digital flexor tendon (24% at 24 h) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. This might be due to systemic distribution of the MSCs after injection but this might also reflect a limitation of the tracking technique. Suboptimal label persistence has been demonstrated after injection of 
 <sup>99m</sup>Tc-HMPAO-labeled MSCs in dogs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Although it is harder to demonstrate in horses due to physical limitations in imaging the whole body (size and signal attenuation), it is likely that the measured persistence is an underestimation of the actual cell persistence due to loss of label from some of the cells.
