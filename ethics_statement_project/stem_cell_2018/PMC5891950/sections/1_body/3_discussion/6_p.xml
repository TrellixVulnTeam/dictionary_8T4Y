<p id="Par72">In this study, both AO and LS transplantation of ASCs was technically easy and safe to perform, with no demonstrated adverse effects in horses. Furthermore, the neurologic status was not altered in any of the horses (healthy or diseased) in this study. The caudal distribution of the labeled ASCs after AO injection and the lack of cranial migration after LS injection suggest that the cells are progressing in the direction of CSF flow in the absence of any identified spinal cord lesions. The lower persistence at the AO injection site when compared to LS is consistent with the subjective assessment of migration of ASCs. The caudal migration of ASCs injected at the AO space is likely responsible for this lower persistence.</p>
