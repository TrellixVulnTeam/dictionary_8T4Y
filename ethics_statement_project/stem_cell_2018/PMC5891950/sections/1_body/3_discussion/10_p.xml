<p id="Par76">We were unable to find GFP-labeled ASCs transplanted into diseased horses 7 or 15Â days after ASC injection. This finding could be due to the fact that: 1) the neurologic lesions were chronic and did not attract ASCs to the site; 2) ASCs were not restricted to the spinal cord area and they could have migrated outside the CSF or distributed throughout the subarachnoid space; or 3) ASCs could have undergone cell death.</p>
