<p id="Par69">A single intrathecal administration of allogenic ASCs to healthy horses did not elicit an anti-MSC alloantibody response. These findings may suggest that, in the absence of disease and breakdown of the blood–brain barrier, a systemic response to allogenic cells will not be mounted. In our previous study, low-dose cell administrations or a single dose also did not elicit an anti-MSC antibody response whereas multiple high doses into a tendon lesion did elicit a response [
