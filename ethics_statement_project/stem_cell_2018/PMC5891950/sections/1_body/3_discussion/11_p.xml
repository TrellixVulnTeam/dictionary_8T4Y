<p id="Par77">A study with ASCs labeled with Qtracker 655 quantom dots showed that ASCs were still found at an equine tendon lesion site 1-week postinjection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Another study compared administration of GFP-labeled ASC trough intravenous, intraperitoneal, and subcutaneous routes in mice, and after 75 days eGFP-bright cells were found in the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidney, and omental fat by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cytospin analyses [

It has also been demonstrated in mice that MSCs injected intra-arterially selectively engraft in the bone marrow after a localized radiation up to 33 weeks. In this study, the authors used bioluminescent imaging to measure cell distribution of monomeric red fluorescent protein/luciferase MSCs [
