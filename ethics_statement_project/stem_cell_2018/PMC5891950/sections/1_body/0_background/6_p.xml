<p id="Par33">The objectives of this study were: 1) to determine the safety of a relatively high dose of intrathecal adipose-derived MSCs (ASCs) in healthy horses; 2) to track ASCs after AO and LS administration in healthy horses; and 3) to determine if ASCs would migrate to the diseased spinal cord site in horses with severe neurologic disease and survive in the central nervous system for 2Â weeks following inoculation.</p>
