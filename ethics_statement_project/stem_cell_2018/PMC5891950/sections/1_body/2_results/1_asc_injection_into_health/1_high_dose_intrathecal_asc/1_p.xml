<p id="Par54">ASC administration was readily performed in both standing (LS) and laterally recumbent anesthetized horses (AO). No adverse events were noted during or after ASC administration. The complete blood count and biochemical profile showed no alterations prior to or after ASC injection (with or without 
 <sup>99m</sup>Tc-HMPAO) for either AO or LS groups. All mares had normal physical and neurological examinations prior and after the administration of ASCs, including the 30Â day recheck examination post-injection.
