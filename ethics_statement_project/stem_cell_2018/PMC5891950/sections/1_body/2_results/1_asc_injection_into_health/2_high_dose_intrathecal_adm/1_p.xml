<p id="Par55">There were no statistical differences between AO and LS CSF parameters prior to or after ASC administration; as such, the groups were combined for further analysis. In addition, there were no significant differences in CSF total protein, nucleated cell count, or cell differential prior to or after ASC administration (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). The majority of horses had normal cell counts, total protein, and cell differential both prior to and after ASC administration. Prior to ASC administration, 2/6 horses (33%) had increased nucleated cell count (9 and 13 cells/μL, reference range ≤ 5 cells/μL) and all horses had a normal total protein concentration (reference range &lt; 100 mg/dL). These changes were not considered clinically relevant in light of normal neurological and physical examination. Thirty days after ASC administration, 1/6 horses (17%) had an increased CSF protein (121 mg/dL) and 5/6 horses (83%) had an increased nucleated cell count (6, 6, 7, 13, and 26 cells/μl).
