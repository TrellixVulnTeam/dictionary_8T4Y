<p id="Par63">Three of the four horses had high titers to BSA at day 0 and those titers remained high at day 30 and at 14 months following Ad-MSC administration. One horse had a low positive titer to BSA at day 0 and that titer remained low at day 30 following Ad-MSC administration. This horse converted to a high BSA titer at the 14 month recheck, likely due to recent vaccination.</p>
