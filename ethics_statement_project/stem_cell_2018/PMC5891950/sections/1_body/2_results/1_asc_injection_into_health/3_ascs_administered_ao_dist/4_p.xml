<p id="Par61">Radiolabel persistence at the injection site was quantified (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Persistence decreased over time with all three injections. The persistence after AO injection at the later time points was lower than after LS injection. The persistence after the control injection was lower at all time points except for that at 24 h.
