<p id="Par58">Immediately after AO injection of radiolabeled ASCs, a radioactive signal was identified with the maximal intensity at the site of injection and extending cranially into the caudal aspect of the cranial vault and caudally to the level of the second cervical vertebra (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, c</xref>). One hour after injection, a radioactive signal was present at the level of the first thoracic vertebra and, at 5 h, the radioactive signal could be identified reaching the lumbar spine (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). At 24 h postinjection, the radioactive signal was still present and strong in the cranial cervical vertebral canal, with a weaker signal seen within the lumbar spine. The radioactive signal remained the most intense at the injection site at all time points.
