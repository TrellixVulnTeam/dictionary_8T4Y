<p id="Par59">After LS injection, a radioactive signal was immediately visible at the level of the last lumbar vertebra and cranial sacrum (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, d</xref>). Over time, the signal extended caudally to the posterior dural sac, while a minimal radioactive signal extended cranially (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The signal was still identified at 24 h postinjection.
