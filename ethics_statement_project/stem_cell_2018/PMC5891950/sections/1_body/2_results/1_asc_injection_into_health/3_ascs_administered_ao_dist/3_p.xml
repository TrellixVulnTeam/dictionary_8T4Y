<p id="Par60">The distribution and progression of the free 
 <sup>99m</sup>Tc-HMPAO radioactive signal after AO administration was similar to the injection of labeled ASCs, with the signal reaching the cranial thoracic area after 1 h and the sacral area after 5 h (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Mild uptake was apparent in the thyroid gland after the control injection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref>). This was not seen with the labeled ASC injection.
