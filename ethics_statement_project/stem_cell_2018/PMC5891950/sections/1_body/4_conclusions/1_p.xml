<p id="Par80">Our results demonstrate that AO and LS intrathecal injection of allogeneic ASCs is safe and easy to perform in horses. Additionally, due to the flow of CSF from cranial to caudal, AO administration of ASCs had a better distribution within the subarachnoid space and presumably to the spinal cord from the cervical to the lumbosacral region, suggesting that this approach might be more suitable for cranial lesions in the spinal cord. ASCs could not be found at 15Â days after injection at the site of injury in horses with CVCM, suggesting that ASCs did not have time to reach the lesion site or that ASCs did not stay/survive in the spinal cord for this period of time in a high enough number to be detected. Additional work needs to be performed to determine if multiple intrathecal allogeneic MSC injections are well tolerated as well as the efficacy of MSCs to treat horses with inflammatory or degenerative lesions of the nervous system.</p>
