 </sup> only patients treated with TKI for at least three years and with 
 <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> levels below MR3 for at least the last year of treatment were used. Therefore, we excluded from the study 53 patients treated for less than three years (excluding n=4 for IRIS; n=49 for CML-IV) and 14 patients with no MR3 in the entire last year of treatment (excluding n=4 for IRIS; n=10 for CML-IV). The time courses of the remaining 122 patients [(n=47 IRIS, median follow up 6.5 years [IQR(5.9;6.9)]; n=75 CML-IV, median follow up 4.6 years [IQR(3.9;6.1)] are available in 
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S1</italic>. Following the DESTINY trial, these patients were further split into an MR4 and an MR3 cohort, depending on whether their 
 <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> levels in the last year were below MR4 or not. These selection and classification procedures were based on the individual bi-exponential fit 
 <italic>LOB</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) of each patient (also shown in 
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S1</italic>).
