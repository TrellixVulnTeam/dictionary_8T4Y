<p>Although TKI treatment response is still substantially heterogeneous with respect to many clinical parameters, the well-defined CML phenotype and the accessibility of kinetic data on treatment response has made CML a primary target for mathematical model approaches in oncology.

 </sup> It has also been recognized that the regulation of stem cell quiescence under continuing TKI therapy affects the kinetics of disease eradication.

 </sup> However, this model assumed no direct therapeutic effect on LSCs, which are, therefore, increasing even during treatment.
