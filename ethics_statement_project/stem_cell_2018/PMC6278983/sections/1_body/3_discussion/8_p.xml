<p>In summary, we show that the systematic assessment of available clinical data by means of mathematical models has direct clinical implications, but also reveals underlying disease and treatment mechanisms. Our results are substantiated by and support the interim findings of the ongo ing DESTINY trial, thereby suggesting a change in current clinical practice and the consideration of TKI dose de-escalation strategies in maintenance therapy. As with any theoretical prediction, our results represent hypotheses that need to be validated in clinical trials. However, modeling approaches can substantially support the design of informative trials. We consider this simulation study as a proof-of-concept for the use of systems medicine to optimize treatment efficacy and to minimize health care costs.</p>
