<p>Our study supports the concept that TKI dose reduction in maintenance therapy can be a safe option for many CML patients who have already achieved a sustained remission. In particular, we dissect the typical biphasic response pattern under continuing TKI treatment and conclude that the TKI effect during the secondary treatment phase is limited by the rare activation of quiescent LSCs. Our simulations predict that the overall treatment effect is maintained for most patients, even if the TKI dose is reduced. Based on their initial treatment response under full dose, we identify patients who most likely benefit from a reduction scheme and present a strategy to estimate a patient-specific, optimal dose. Our results suggest a treatment strategy that could considerably reduce cumulative drug intake and, therefore, decrease drug-mediated side-effects. It might also increase compliance of patients to adhere to the prescribed treatment schedule. On the population level, the long overall survival times of continuously treated CML-patients add a distinct economical aspect to the outlined strategy, as the high treatment costs could be substantially reduced.</p>
