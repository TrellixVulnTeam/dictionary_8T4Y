<p>Our modeling results predict a transient increase of the number of proliferating LCs after dose reduction. However, because this is only a transient and expected effect, we suggest that the clinical criteria for molecular relapse after dose de-escalation would benefit from considering a follow-up period rather than focusing on fixed thresholds. Although the transient increase in proliferating LCs might increase the chance of acquiring secondary mutations, we reason that this is a marginal effect which needs to be compared with the benefits of reducing treatment-related side-effects. Indeed, assuming that the risk of acquiring a secondary mutation is proportional to the number of proliferating LSCs divisions, this risk increases by only 1.5% when half-dose is applied for three years (after an initial period of three years under standard dose) in comparison with the full-dose scenario (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Text S12</italic> and 
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S10</italic>). We acknowledge that our estimates are based on the assumptions that there are no direct dose-dependent resistance mechanisms. This is supported by the observation that re-starting TKI treatment after relapse in cessation studies proved overall successful and did not suggest a higher tendency for TKI resistances.
