<p>Several clinical studies have addressed the potential of dose reductions in various settings. While Naqvi

 </sup> In the later study, one-third of the patients lost their previous remission levels. Based on our model, we speculate whether the extended treatment interruptions might have added to this outcome as no therapeutically active TKI concentrations were achieved during this time. Furthermore, we have seen that several clinical studies reported a clear advantage of more potent TKI to achieve molecular response earlier as compared to standard-dose imatinib.

 </sup> However, the corresponding advantage in long-term survival is less pronounced, and we suggest that it is not the drug potency but the rare activation of LSCs that marginalizes the survival benefit.
