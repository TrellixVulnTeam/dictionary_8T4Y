<p>The proposed strategy is not restricted to a particular TKI. Although our model encompasses all TKI pharmaco-kinetic parameters and doses within a single parameter

 </italic>, we have found that this simple model, using a relative reduction compared to a standard dose of the respective TKI, is equivalent to a more elaborate formulation explicitly considering the daily TKI intake (

 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S9</italic>). Although a linear dose-response relationship appears to be an appropriate model assumption,

 </sup> we estimate this limit to be in the order of 25% of the original dose (
