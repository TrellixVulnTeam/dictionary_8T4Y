<p>In order to test our predictions in a controlled clinical setting, we suggest an approach in which the dynamics of initial treatment response to standard therapy are sufficiently monitored to obtain reliable estimates of the relevant slopes for an informed treatment adaptation (measurements every 3â€“4 months within the first year and at least every six months thereafter). Only after a clinically relevant remission level (at least MR3) is reached can dose reductions (e.g. &lt; 50% of the initial dose) be considered and these should be accompanied by a detailed follow-up monitoring of 
 <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> levels to guarantee patient safety and also inform on the validity of our model approach. Further dose reductions might be considered as a second step towards approaching an optimally reduced dose that retains the therapeutic threshold.
