<p>Our results support the rationale for TKI dose de-escalation in patients who have already reached sustained remission. We provide strong evidence that the long-term depletion of residual LSCs in remission phase is not affected by defined TKI-dose reduction. Furthermore, we propose a strategy to determine patient-specific optimal TKI doses, and predict that dose-halving is a safe treatment option for the majority of patients in sustained molecular remission. The suggested dose optimization can contribute to the prevention of severe side-effects (e.g. cardiovascular complications, pleural effusion) and to a reduction of overall treatment costs.</p>
