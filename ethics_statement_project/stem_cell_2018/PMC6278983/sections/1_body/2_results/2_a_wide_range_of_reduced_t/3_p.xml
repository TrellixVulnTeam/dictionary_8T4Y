<p>This optimal fraction

 </italic> corresponds to the minimal favorable dose which still maintains the original long-term reduction rate of both proliferating and quiescent LSCs. Therefore, as long as the TKI dose is not reduced below this threshold, our model predicts no impaired long-term efficiency, while an over-reduction compromises the overall treatment success.
