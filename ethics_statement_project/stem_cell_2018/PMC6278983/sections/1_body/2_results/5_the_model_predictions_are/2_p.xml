<p>Although our model does not yet reflect immunological effects, which are proposed to be important determinants of disease dynamics post TKI-cessation, we speculated about the relative impact of dose reductions with respect to treatment stop. Specifically, we simulated the DESTINY cessation protocol for the IRIS and CML-IV patients in our data-set and evaluated the primary DESTINY end point, i.e. the proportion of patients who can de-escalate TKI dose by 50% for one year and then stop treatment completely for two years without losing MR3. Our simulations indicate higher rates of molecular relapse in comparison to a structurally identical control group receiving full-dose before TKI stop (

However, comparing dose reductions of different duration, we predict a beneficial effect if patients remain at half-dose for longer before stopping TKI. We conclude that the same cumulative dose is more efficient if applied over a longer time period, thereby emphasizing that the full benefit of TKI dose de-escalation appears in the long term.
