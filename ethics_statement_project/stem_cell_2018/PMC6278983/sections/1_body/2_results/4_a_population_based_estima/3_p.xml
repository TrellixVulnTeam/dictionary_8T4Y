<p>Our results also suggest that the ratio 
 <italic>α</italic>/
 <italic>β</italic> can be used to identify patients who are likely to benefit from dose reduction. We predict that patients with 
 <italic>α</italic>/
 <italic>β</italic>&gt;15 are very likely to retain the original long-term treatment efficiency after a 50% dose reduction (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S7B and C</italic>). Furthermore, we derived a condition to identify patients who do not obtain sufficient TKI dose initially. Specifically, we found that patients with slopes 
 <italic>α</italic>/
 <italic>β</italic>&lt;2 would benefit from dose escalation, while only patients with 
 <italic>α</italic>/
 <italic>β</italic>≫2 benefit from dose de-escalation (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S8</italic>).
