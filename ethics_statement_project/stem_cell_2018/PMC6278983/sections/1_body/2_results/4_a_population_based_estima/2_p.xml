<p>Based on these different possible scenarios (i.e. different leukemia growth parameters), we calculated for each patient the fraction of its individual values of

 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S6F</italic>). This fraction indicates whether dose-halving appears as a suitable treatment option or not. With these estimates, our model predicts that 90% of the patients in the German IRIS cohort and 81% of the patients in the CML-IV trial who once achieved MR3, could have safely decreased their TKI dose by at least 50%, while maintaining the overall therapy effect on quiescent LSCs (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S7A</italic>). Therefore, dose-halving is expected to be safe for the majority of patients in sustained remission and might serve as the initial step to estimate the optimal individual dose.
