The CURE-iv trial was a phase I, uncontrolled, open label trial for RA patients with moderate disease activity despite treatment with methotrexate. The patients received a single intravenous infusion of 2.5 \u00d7 107 , 5 \u00d7 107 , or 1 \u00d7 108 cells of hUCB-MSCs for 30 minutes, three patients in each cluster, with an increment of cell numbers when there was no dose-limited adverse event. Clinical and safety assessments were performed during the study period, and serum cytokines were measured at baseline and 24 hours after the infusion. Out of 11 screened RA patients, 9 were enrolled. The participants were predominantly female (78%) and the mean age was 57.4 years. The mean disease duration was 9.5 years, and baseline 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28; using erythrocyte sedimentation rate) was 4.53.
