  </caption>
  <p>This is the first human trial that has investigated the outcome of human umbilical cord blood‐derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB‐MSCs) infusions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA patients with moderate disease activity were given a single infusion of hUCB‐MSCs, cell numbers up to 1 × 10
   <sup>8</sup>, and no ominous short‐term safety signal was observed. In addition, a single infusion of hUCB‐MSCs reduced the mean 28‐joint disease activity score of the study participants. Data from this trial provide insight and suggestions for future trials assessing safety plus clinical efficacy, furthering treatment protocols of hUCB‐MSCs infusions for RA patients who are in need.
