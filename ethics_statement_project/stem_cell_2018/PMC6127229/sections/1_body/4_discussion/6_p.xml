<p>This study has some limitations. First, the sample size was relatively small and the duration of the follow‐up period after the infusion of hUCB‐MSCs was short for the exploration of long‐term safety; we are currently conducting a 5‐year observational study to search for any safety signal in our subjects. Also, there was no placebo group for further comparison with the hUCB‐MSC recipients. Second, the administration of a single infusion of hUCB‐MSCs is prohibitive in determining whether repetitive infusions would have similar safety outcomes. Third, among the study participants no one was exposed to biologic DMARDs; future trials are planned to enroll, if not limited to, previous biologic users. Lastly, although a range of clinical outcomes was assessed, imaging studies were excluded due to the short follow‐up period. Future investigations including long‐term radiographic outcomes in hUCB‐MSC‐treated patients would be interesting.</p>
