<p>This phase Ia study demonstrated that a single intravenous infusion of hUCB‐MSCs resulted in a favorable safety profile for our subjects with RA. The patients were given a single infusion of hUCB‐MSCs, with cell numbers up to 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup>, and no DLT was reported. No major toxicity was observed up to 4 weeks after each infusion of hUCB‐MSCs. With regard to efficacy assessment, disease activity change was not the primary objective of this study, but a single infusion of hUCB‐MSCs reduced the mean DAS28 at week 4.
