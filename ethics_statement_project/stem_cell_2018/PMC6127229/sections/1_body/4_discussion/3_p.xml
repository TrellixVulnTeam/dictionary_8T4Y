<p>MSCs exert their therapeutic potential in a series of experimental arthritis by upregulating Treg cells and downregulating the expression of Th17 cells, which subsequently restores the immune function by inducing tolerance, promoting immune modulation, and reducing the release of inflammatory cytokines

 <xref rid="sct312331-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref>. Increasing evidence indicates the existence of a reciprocal relationship between Th17 cells and Treg cells; there is an inverse relationship between the transcription factor retinoic acid receptor‐related orphan receptor C (for Th17 cells) and FoxP3 (for Treg cells) in the joints of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
 <xref rid="sct312331-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref>. MSC treatment reduces pathogenic T cell subsets, such as granulocyte macrophage colony‐stimulating factor‐expressing CD4 T cells, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, and Th1/Th17 cells in the collagen‐induced arthritis (CIA) model

 <xref rid="sct312331-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref>. Moreover, MSCs induce the apoptosis of activated T cells via the Fas ligand (FasL)/Fas signaling pathway in CIA 
 <xref rid="sct312331-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref>. MSCs overexpressing IL‐10 have also attenuated CIA 
 <xref rid="sct312331-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref>. They inhibit the proliferation and expression of proinflammatory cytokines—such as interferon‐γ and TNF‐α—as well as the production of the matrix‐degrading enzymes collagenase and gelatinase, which are involved in the inflammatory response within the synovium 
 <xref rid="sct312331-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref>. MSCs also prevent systemic bone loss in CIA via the direct inhibition of receptor activator of NF‐kB ligand‐induced osteoclastogenesis
