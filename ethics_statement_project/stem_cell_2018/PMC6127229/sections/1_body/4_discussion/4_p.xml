<p>In vitro or preclinical studies have extensively examined the immunomodulatory actions of UCB‐MSCs in RA. UCB‐MSCs exert a profound inhibitory effect on the proliferation, invasive behavior, and inflammatory responses of fibroblast‐like synoviocytes (FLSs) via IL‐10, indoleamine 2,3‐dioxygenase, and transforming growth factor β1. They also suppress T cell activations and induced the generation of Tregs

In overall, hUCB‐MSCs demonstrably correct an immunity imbalance by downregulating the Th1 subset, decreasing the Th17 subset, inducing Tregs, and inhibiting the generation of Tfh cells which attenuate the severity of arthritis comparable to biologic treatments
