<p>MSCs reportedly have the capabilities to modulate immune responses as well as to heal damaged tissues and organs 
 <xref rid="sct312331-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>. They secrete a multitude of cytokines and growth factors with immunosuppressive properties, which inhibit B and T cell proliferation as well as monocyte maturation

 <xref rid="sct312331-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>. In addition, they are considered to possess a low immunogenicity due to their limited expression of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I, the lack of MHC expression as well as of costimulatory molecules, and the inability to stimulate T cell activation
