<p>In a prior phase I study of hUC‐MSC infusions in Chinese patients with active RA, the subjects received 4 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> cells of hUC‐MSCs via an intravenous infusion, with some patients being additionally infused with hUC‐MSCs at 3‐month intervals after the first treatment. The infusions were well tolerated and no major abnormalities were observed

 <sup>8</sup>. However, no subjects exhibited an infusion reaction, a serious adverse event, or major abnormalities in serum chemical or hematologic profiles, both during and after the treatment. Although increased mean serum uric acid levels were observed, they were within the normal range, the changes were trivial, and no related AE was discovered throughout the study. Nevertheless, we plan to monitor serum uric acid levels in the future trials with repeated infusions. A randomized, placebo‐controlled, phase Ib/IIa trial recently demonstrated the safety of repeated infusions (days 1, 5, and 18) of adipose‐derived MSCs in patients with active RA; a trend for clinical efficacy was observed, yet it did not persist beyond 3 months after the infusion
