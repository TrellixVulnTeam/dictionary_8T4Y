<p>There was no ominous safety signal in all clusters up to 4 weeks after the infusion of hUCB‐MSCs. The vital signs were stable during the hUCB‐MSC infusion and clinically meaningful ECG changes could not be observed. Only one patient in the 5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> group reported joint pain 60 minutes after the infusion, but this was determined to be unrelated to the hUCB‐MSCs infusion. There was no major abnormal finding in the hematologic profiles (Table 
 <xref rid="sct312331-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Abnormalities were not observed in the serum chemical profiles such as of liver and renal functions. Serum uric acid levels were slightly elevated (from 3.63 ± 1.11 to 4.16 ± 1.19 mg/dl) at 4 weeks, but the changes were minor and there was no related adverse event. Neither serious adverse event nor dose‐limiting toxicity (DLT) was reported.
