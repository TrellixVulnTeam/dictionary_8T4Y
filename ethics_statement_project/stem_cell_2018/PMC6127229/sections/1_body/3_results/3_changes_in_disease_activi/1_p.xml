<p>The ESR and C‐reactive protein level changes from baseline to week 4 were −7.9 ± 10.4 mm/hour (
 <italic>p</italic> = .0517) and −0.37 ± 1.09 mg/dl (
 <italic>p</italic> = .3362), respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="sct312331-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). At 4 weeks after the hUCB‐MSCs infusion, the DAS28 reduction was statistically significant (−1.60 ± 1.57 mm/hour, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .0158; Table 
 <xref rid="sct312331-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The HAQ score and pain VAS changes at week 4 were −0.15 ± 0.48 (
 <italic>p</italic> = .3706), and −17.9 ± 27.7 (
 <italic>p</italic> = .0885), respectively. Serum levels of IL‐1β, IL‐6, IL‐8, IL‐10, and TNF‐α at baseline and 24 hours after the hUCB‐MSCs infusion are depicted in Supporting Information Figure 
 <xref rid="sct312331-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>. Reduced levels of IL‐1β, IL‐6, IL‐8, and TNF‐α at 24 hours were observed in the cluster infused with 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> cells, yet inconsistent results were found in the cluster given 2.5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> or 5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> cells (Supporting Information Figure 
 <xref rid="sct312331-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). A statistically significant increase in levels of IL‐10, an immunosuppressive cytokine produced by regulatory T (Treg) cells, was discovered at 24 hours in the cluster infused with 5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> cells.
