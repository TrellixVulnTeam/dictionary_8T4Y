<p>Out of the 11 screened RA patients, 9 were enrolled and received a single intravenous infusion of hUCB‐MSCs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="sct312331-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The cell numbers of hUCB‐MSCs infused to each patient were 2.5 × 10

 <sup>7</sup> (

 <sup>8</sup> (

The disease duration was (mean ± SD) 9.5 ± 8.7 years and the DAS28 at baseline was 4.53 ± 1.35. All subjects had received MTX, with mean doses of 14.2 mg/week at baseline and seven of them were taking oral corticosteroids (Table
