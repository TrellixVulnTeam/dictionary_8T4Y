 <xref rid="sct312331-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>. Based on the immunoregulatory capabilities of MSCs, cell‐based therapies using MSCs have been spotlighted as a promising tool for the treatment of various immune‐related diseases, such as the graft‐versus‐host disease, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, and atopic dermatitis
