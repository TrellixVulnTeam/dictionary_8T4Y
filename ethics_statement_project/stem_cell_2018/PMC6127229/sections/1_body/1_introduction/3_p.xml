<p>The main sources of human MSCs are the bone marrow, peripheral blood, adipose tissue, and the umbilical cord. Compared with bone marrow‐derived MSCs, human umbilical cord blood‐derived MSCs (hUCB‐MSCs) have distinct advantages, including accessibility, a higher proliferation capacity, and a lower immunogenicity
