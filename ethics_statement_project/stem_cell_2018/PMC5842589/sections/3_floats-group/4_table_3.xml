   <sup>a</sup>4{3} notation is to be interpreted in the following way: Table 
   <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> inclusion criteria 4 is equivalent to Table 
   <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> inclusion criteria 3. In this case, the notation does not transfer back to Table 
   <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>
