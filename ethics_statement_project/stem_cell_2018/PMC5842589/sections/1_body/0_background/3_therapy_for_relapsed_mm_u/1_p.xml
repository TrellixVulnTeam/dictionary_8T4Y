<p id="Par68">Currently, there are three trials registered on the 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> website involving ASCT in the salvage setting. One study (NCT01745588) aims to compare salvage ASCT with the IMiD pomalidomide as a maintenance schedule against a non-ASCT strategy of pomalidomide, clarithromycin and dexamethasone. The second trial (NCT01242267) aims to address the augmentation of high-dose melphalan with increasing doses of thalidomide in a phase I/II setting. The third trial (NCT00938626) aims to utilise a bi-specific antibody to CD3 and CD20 to augment T cell activation post-salvage ASCT re-infusion in a phase I/II setting, again not addressing the key issues raised above. These trials will report in the early years of recruitment of this study, and their results will be monitored closely. Each of these studies is USA-based and, hence, may have limited impact on UK practice.
