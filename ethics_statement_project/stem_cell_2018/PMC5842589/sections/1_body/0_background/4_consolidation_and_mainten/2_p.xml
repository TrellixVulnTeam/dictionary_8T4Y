<p id="Par70">The question of how best to maximise the DuR to salvage ASCT warrants clinical investigation. Given the expanding scope of therapeutic agents with differing modes of delivery (intravenous (IV) vs. subcutaneous (SC) vs. oral) combined with the potential for community-based therapy delivery, patient engagement with long-term maintenance strategies becomes a real opportunity. However, an evidence basis for the efficacy and thus the incorporation of further post-ASCT therapy is needed. The second question is to establish which patients benefit and, more importantly, which patients do not benefit from salvage ASCT. There is some evidence that molecular risk stratification at relapse after a prior transplant may delineate subgroups where a second transplant offers no advantage in terms of DuR. This clearly requires a more in-depth examination [
