<p id="Par99">In order to proceed to R1, participants must have achieved at least SD (according to the IMWG criteria). It is foreseen that not all participants will achieve a minimum of SD. Hence, to enable the study to retain enough power for the statistical analysis of the research question associated with the second randomisation (R2), we require a minimum of 284/406 participants to proceed to R1. The anticipated dropout rate is based on previous experience in the Myeloma X trial. Participants who do not show at least SD will cease trial treatment and will receive off-trial treatment at the discretion of the treating clinician. The trial opened to recruitment in March 2017 and is due to close to recruitment in February 2022 or when the planned sample sizes have been reached, whichever is earlier.</p>
