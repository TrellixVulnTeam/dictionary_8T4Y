<p id="Par128">The trial was developed by the ACCoRd Trial Management Group (TMG), with the support of the UK Myeloma Research Alliance (UK-MRA or NCRI Myeloma Subgroup). The trial is sponsored by the University of Leeds (Research &amp; Innovation Centre/Faculty of Medicine &amp; Health, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust/University of Leeds, St James University Hospital, Leeds, LS9 7TF and is registered (ISRCTN10038996, EudraCT Number 2016-000905-35). A core project team, a TMG, a Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and a DMEC have been established. The independent DMEC review the safety and ethics of the trial alongside trial progress, and the overall direction is overseen by the TSC. Six-monthly interim safety reports are presented to the DMEC with a full review annually. The committee members will determine the subsequent frequency of review. The DMEC, in light of the interim data and of any advice or evidence they wish to request, will advise the TSC if there are any concerns or reasons why the trial should not continue. The results of the study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and will be presented at relevant national and international conferences. The CTRU will control the final trial dataset, and any requests for access will be reviewed by the TMG and TSC, subject to existing contractual arrangements with the funders. To maintain the scientific integrity of the trial, data will not be released prior to the end of the trial, either for trial publication or oral presentation purposes, without the permission of the TSC or the Chief Investigator.</p>
