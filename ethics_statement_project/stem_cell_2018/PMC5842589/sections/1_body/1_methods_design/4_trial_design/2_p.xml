<p id="Par83">All participants will be registered at trial entry and will receive re-induction therapy with four to six 28-day cycles of ITD in order to reach maximum response. Participants who achieve at least stable disease (SD), as described by IMWG criteria, will be randomised on a 1:1 basis to receive either ASCT
 <sub>Con</sub>, using melphalan, or ASCT
 <sub>Aug</sub>, using melphalan along with ixazomib. All participants achieving or maintaining a minimal response (MR) or better, following trial ASCT, will undergo a second randomisation to consolidation and maintenance or no further treatment on a 1:1 basis. Participants randomised to consolidation and maintenance will receive consolidation with two 28-day cycles of ITD and maintenance with ixazomib until disease progression. Figure
