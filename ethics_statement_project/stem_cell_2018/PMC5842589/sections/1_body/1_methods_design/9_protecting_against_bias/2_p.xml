<p id="Par106">External confirmation of disease progression and response data will be performed on samples of blood and urine at baseline, post re-induction treatment, 100 days post-transplant, post-consolidation (or 8 weeks post-R2 in the no further therapy arm) and at disease progression at a central laboratory. Samples will be forwarded by centres to relevant laboratories for central analysis. All disease progression and response data will be further confirmed by blinded clinical review coordinated by the CTRU.</p>
