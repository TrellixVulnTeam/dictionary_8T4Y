<p id="Par105">The study is an open-label trial which will use an independent randomisation service, and analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. The trial is administered by the Chief and Principal Investigators and the CTRU in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. Response and relapse will be assessed using the IMWG International Uniform Response Criteria using blood and urine samples (and bone marrow, where required), unless progression of myeloma occurs as an isolated bone lesion, growth of a plasmacytoma or an increase in plasma cells in the bone marrow without a change in M-protein, where a tissue histological examination will be performed.</p>
