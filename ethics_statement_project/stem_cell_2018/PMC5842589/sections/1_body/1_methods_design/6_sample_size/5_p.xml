<p id="Par92">A median PFS of 24 months was observed in the ASCT arm in Myeloma X amongst those participants achieving ≥ VGPR. R2 in ACCoRd is 3 months later than randomisation in Myeloma X; hence, the study is powered to detect a difference in median PFS of 9 months from R2 where that would be expected to be 21 months after R2 in those participants receiving no further consolidation and maintenance treatment and 30 months after R2 in those participants receiving further consolidation and maintenance. Therefore, 192 events are required for 80% power [
