<p id="Par94">Increased follow-up also allows evaluation of protocol treatment and OS as a key secondary endpoint. The 248 participants randomised at R2 provide almost 80% power at a significance level of 0.05 to detect a 15% increase in OS at 5 years after R2 (from an estimated 59% in Myeloma X up to 74% in ACCoRd). A total of 96 events are required for 79% power at minimum 4 years follow-up for all participants.</p>
