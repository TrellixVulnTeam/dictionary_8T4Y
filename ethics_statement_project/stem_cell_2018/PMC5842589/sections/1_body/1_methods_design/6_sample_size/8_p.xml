<p id="Par95">The 284 participants who undergo R1 will receive randomised ASCT (conventional or augmented) treatment. At 100 days post-ASCT, these participants will be assessed for response to treatment. In order to proceed to the next stage of the trial, R2, participants must have achieved a minimum of MR (according to the IMWG criteria). Based on experience of Myeloma X, we anticipate that not all participants will maintain at least SD. In order for the study to retain enough power for the statistical analysis, we require a minimum of 248/284 participants to meet the criteria to proceed to R2. This constitutes an approximate dropout rate of 10%.</p>
