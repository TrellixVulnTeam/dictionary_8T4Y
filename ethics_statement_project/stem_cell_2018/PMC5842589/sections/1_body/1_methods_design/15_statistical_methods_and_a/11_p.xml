<p id="Par126">A series of subgroup and exploratory analyses will be undertaken. Cytogenetic subgroups will be analysed to explore a number of specific hypotheses, including the effect on PFS, OS, time to progression and response. Some examples of what will be studied include chromosome 14 translocations and abnormalities of chromosomes 1p, 1q, 13q and 17p. In addition, other regions considered to be of interest will be analysed according to the statistical analysis plan. Other subgroup and exploratory analyses may also be performed and will be described in the statistical analysis plan or separate analyses plans related to translational work.</p>
