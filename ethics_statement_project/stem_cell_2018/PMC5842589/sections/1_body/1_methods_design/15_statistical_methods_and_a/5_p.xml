<p id="Par120">Formal interim analysis for lack of benefit (or harm in the language of Freidlin and colleagues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]) will be undertaken when 25% of required participants have completed response assessments at 100 days post-ASCT after R1 (46 patients). If the lower 95% confidence bound for the odds ratio comparing the ≥ VGPR rate in ASCT
 <sub>Con</sub> and ASCT
 <sub>Aug</sub> is above 1 (where an odds ratio above 1 means that the ASCT
 <sub>Aug</sub> group is worse), then treatment in this group may be halted. Formal interim analyses for early efficacy will be undertaken when 50% of required participants have completed response assessments at 100 days post-ASCT (91 participants) after R1 and when 50% of required PFS events have been observed (96 events) in follow-up after R2. These interim analyses will be assessed against a pre-specified significance level of 0.005 indicating possible overwhelming evidence of early efficacy. All interim analysis will be advisory with changes to the study at the discretion of study oversight committees. If the interim analysis for R1 leads to changes in the study protocol, study registration would continue to answer the question posed at R2. This would be achieved by extending the registration phase to include the selected treatment option at R1 for all subsequently treated patients before R2. No other formal analysis of the study is planned before the participants have attained the primary endpoints, i.e. all randomised participants have had response evaluated 100 days post-R1 or all randomised participants have been followed up for a minimum of 2 years post-R2. The key secondary endpoint, OS, will be evaluated after all continuing participants have been followed up for a minimum of 4 years post-R2. Analysis of other endpoints will be undertaken alongside these analyses, as appropriate.
