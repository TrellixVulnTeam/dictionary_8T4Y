<p id="Par125">Secondary endpoint analysis of OS and other time-to-event endpoints will be analysed using similar methods to those described for the PFS primary endpoint. MRD negativity will be analysed using similar methods to those described for the response primary endpoint. AEs will be summarised using CTCAE categories. QoL will be summarised using mean scores adjusted for baseline and 95% CIs for each European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-MY20 module symptom, role and functioning domain at each assessment time point. Similar summaries will be produced for quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), as scored by the EQ-5D questionnaire.</p>
