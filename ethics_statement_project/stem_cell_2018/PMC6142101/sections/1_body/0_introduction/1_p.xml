<p>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has become a well-established treatment for hematologic disorders. Since its introduction in 1957, HSCT techniques have improved, resulting in increased survival rates mainly due to a reduction in organ damage and decreases in infection and severe acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

 </sup> In most high-risk acute leukemia patients, HSCT is the only treatment that offers the prospect of long-term survival. This prospect, however, is still dismal, and some studies suggest that 3-year overall survival in such patients is less than 20%.

 </sup> Relapse is still the main cause of death, and together with infections and GVHD, it accounts for 65% to 70% of all posttransplantation mortality.
