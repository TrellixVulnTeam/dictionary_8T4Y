<p>We wondered whether the immunoregulatory properties attributed to some Chinese herbal medicines (CHM) could curtail these mortality rates. Many cell line and animal model studies have demonstrated that some CHM exert favorable effects on the immune system. For instance, extracts of

 <italic>Astragalus membranaceus</italic> (huang qi) can both prompt the proliferation of and mitigate the effects of immunosuppressive agents on bone marrow CD34+ cells.

 </sup> Epidemiological studies have shown that there are correlations between prolonged survival times and the use of CHM among leukemia patients.

 </sup> Although few such studies have been published in peer-reviewed journals, a handful of clinical studies have been conducted in China regarding the use of CHM in post-HSCT leukemia patients, and these have achieved positive results.
