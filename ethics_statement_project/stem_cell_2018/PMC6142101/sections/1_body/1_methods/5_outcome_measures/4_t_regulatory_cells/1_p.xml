<p>The incidence of either MRD+ or relapse in patients with a high frequency of CD4+CD25−CD69+ T cells (&gt;7%) has been reported to be significantly higher than that of patients with a low frequency of CD4+CD25−CD69+ T cells at +60 days, +90 days, and +270 days after transplant.

 </sup> Also, in vitro and animal models have shown that the increase of donor CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells can suppress the early expansion of alloreactive T cells—a hallmark of acute GVHD.

 </sup> Clinical studies that have adopted this treatment principle have shown that infusion of donor T regulatory cells can prevent GVHD while favoring the reconstitution of regular T cells.
