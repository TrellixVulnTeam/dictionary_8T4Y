<p>The main outcome measured in this study is the immune reconstitution rate of key cell populations, which is measured using flow cytometry with peripheral blood samples. If possible, records of minimal residual disease (MRD) from bone marrow aspirations and the occurrence rate of opportunistic infections, hospitalization frequency, and relapse rates should be obtained and considered secondary outcome measures. An additional secondary outcome measure is the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire.</p>
