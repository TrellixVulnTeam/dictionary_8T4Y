<p>No consensus exists regarding the ideal sampling rate for measurement of long-term immune reconstitution. In the protocol described above, we obtained peripheral blood samples from patients monthly, over the course of 1 year. Currently, we believe that 6 samples over the course of 1 year should be adequate, and other recently published studies have also followed this protocol (

 </sup> With regard to the inclusion criteria, we originally intended this study to focus on patients with acute leukemia. However, since the total number of patients that undergo allo-HSCT is limited, we suggest a revision of this condition to open the trial to all patients undergoing allo-HSCT. As noted above, different disease diagnoses should have no effect on the rate of immune reconstitution.
