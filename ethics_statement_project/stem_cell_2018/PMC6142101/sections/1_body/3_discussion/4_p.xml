<p>In its acute form, GVHD commonly presents within the first 100 days post-HSCT. In all trials we reviewed that were conducted in China, herbal treatment was administered during this period. To avoid unnecessary risk, the initiation of herbal treatment in this protocol was defined as 3 months following transplantation. Herbal treatment should be discontinued in the case of manifestation of moderate to severe chronic GVHD per the assessment of the attending oncologist. In our preliminary trial, patients were offered to continue receiving herbal medicine after the alleviation of GVHD if they were able to complete the treatment course prior to the 1-year posttransplantation time point. We believe future trial protocols should adopt this option.</p>
