<p>While designing this study, we were uncertain about the appropriate monetary incentive to use to motivate patients to enroll. We found that many patients were indifferent toward this incentive and that the backing of the respective attending oncologist was the most crucial factor for enrollment. This is understandable in light of the decisions and repercussions these patients face. The processing of blood samples together with the monetary incentive for patients per sample constituted a major portion of the resources required for this study, and their revision directly relates to the feasibility of a larger trial.</p>
