<p>Mortality was not chosen as a primary outcome measure for this study for a number of reasons. First, the prognoses of affected patients vary widely according to numerous factors, such as severity of disease, gender, genetic and molecular abnormalities, as well as donor type (ie, familial relationships and HLA-matching).

 </sup> No data that we know of suggest different rates of immune reconstitution according to disease, and other recently published studies have excluded the consideration of these factors in their study design.

 </sup> Second, as most deaths occur within the first 2 years of HSCT, measuring mortality would require an additional year of follow-up. Measurement of immune reconstitution allows for the simultaneous assessment of multiple factors and offers insights concerning the possible mechanisms of action of the intervention.
