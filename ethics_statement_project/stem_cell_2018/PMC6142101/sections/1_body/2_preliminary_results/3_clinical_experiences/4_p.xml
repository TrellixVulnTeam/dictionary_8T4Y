<p>We also studied the in vitro effects of SYT on patient unsorted PBMC with regard to the secretion of IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNF-α, which are representative cytokines of the TH1 subset that are known to be directly related to graft-versus-leukemia and GVHD (

 </sup> Due to the small sample size of measurements, we did not achieve statistical significance, and the only distinguishable trend was a decrease in TNF-α. GVHD is a result of the interplay between multiple types of cell components and cytokines, but TNF-α plays a central role, and its reduction is known to decrease the symptoms of GVHD.

 </sup> Whether this implies that SYT may mitigate GVHD requires further investigation. This type of in vitro examination should be considered exploratory as it is unlikely that a simple increase or decrease in a single signaling factor is predictive of the clinical outcome. IL-2, for example, may induce the proliferation of T cells, exacerbating post-HSCT on one hand and inducing immunosuppression via T regulatory cells on the other.

 </sup> This assay is thus not defined as an outcome measure, though it might provide complementary insight to other observations from the trial.
