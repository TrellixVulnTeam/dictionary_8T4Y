  <p>Immune reconstitution of various other cell compartments. Because there is no certain way to predict in advance which, if any, subset of cells will be affected by Sheng-Yu-Tang, it would be preferable to track the reconstitution of as many cell compartments as possible.</p>
  <p>Abbreviations: TCM, traditional Chinese medicine; PT, pretransplantation; NK, natural killer.</p>
