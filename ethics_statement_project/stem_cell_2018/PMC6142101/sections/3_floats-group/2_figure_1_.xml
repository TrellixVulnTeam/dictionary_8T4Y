 <caption>
  <p>Average differences in immune reconstitution of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Patient sample size of current data is insufficient to draw conclusions; however, these data demonstrate the possible contribution of this type of analysis. There is, for example, a distinct difference in relative proportion of CD4+ na√Øve cells and CD8+ terminally differentiated cells, between the 2 groups. Missing columns represent time points at which no samples were collected from any patients.</p>
  <p>Abbreviations: TCM, traditional Chinese medicine; PT, pretransplantation; CM, central memory; EM, effector memory; TEMRA, terminally differentiated effector memory.</p>
