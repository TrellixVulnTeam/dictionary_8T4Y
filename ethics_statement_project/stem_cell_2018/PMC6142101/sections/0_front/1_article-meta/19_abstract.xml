  <bold>Introduction:</bold> Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has become a well-established treatment for hematologic disorders including acute leukemia. However, long-term survival rates following this procedure are still extremely low, due to posttransplantation relapse, infections, and graft-versus-host disease. We propose that adjunctive Chinese herbal medicine may benefit posttransplantation patients. In preparation for a randomized clinical trial, we conducted a pilot trial. 
  <bold>Methods and Analysis:</bold> Between September 2015 and June 2017, 18 patients were consecutively enrolled at China Medical University Hospital and followed for up to 1 year. Fresh blood samples were obtained on a monthly basis, and immune reconstitution was analyzed. In addition to the standard-care treatment administered by their oncologist, a number of patients also received a Chinese herbal formula (Sheng-Yu-Tang) for up to 6 months. Results were used to improve on study protocol and estimate required sample size for a future randomized trial. 
  <bold>Ethics and Dissemination:</bold> Study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of China Medical University Hospital (DMR-105-005), and all participants provided informed consent.
