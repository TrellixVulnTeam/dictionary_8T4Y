<p id="p0020">In Taiwan, 80%–90% of HNSCC patients are betel quid chewers, and &gt;40% of our patients experienced ≥ grade 3 stomatitis following ICT PF 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The high incidence of severe stomatitis was due to betel quid-chewing related oral mucosa change 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Severe mucositis, poor compliance, and reduced dose intensity worsened the therapeutic outcomes for ICT PF 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. We have developed cisplatin (P)/tegafur (T) or tegafur-uracil (U)/leucovorin (L) combined regimens since 2002. To ameliorate emesis and nephrotoxicity, cisplatin at 100 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> triweekly was modified to 50 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> biweekly, and to ameliorate stomatitis and maintain efficacy, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) at 1000 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup>/d through 120-h infusion was replaced with daily oral 5-FU prodrugs (tegafur 800 mg/d or tegafur-uracil at 300 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup>/d) 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. According to a dose-finding study investigating toxicity, oral leucovorin at 60 mg/d was used in combination with tegafur for protracted treatment 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. PUL and PTL combinations had lesser toxicity, particularly for severe stomatitis (5%–7%), and stronger efficacy compared with PF in our patients 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Moreover, oral 5-FU prodrugs can be easily administered as radiosensitizers during CCRT. CCRT with PTL in patients of advanced PLSCC yielded a 5-year OS of 59.7%
