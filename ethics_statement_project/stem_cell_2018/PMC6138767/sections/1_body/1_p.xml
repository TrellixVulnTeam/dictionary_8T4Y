<p id="p0010">Numerous attempts have been made to improve the outcomes in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) by combing radiotherapy (RT) with chemotherapy (CT) since the data of the Meta-Analysis of Chemotherapy on Head and Neck Cancer (MACH-NC) revealed a 6.5% 5-year absolute survival benefit of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) 
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. CCRT has been proposed to be the ideal approach to incorporate CT into RT for treating advanced HNSCC. Generally, no overall survival (OS) benefit of induction CT (ICT) schedules has been identified. Only a marginal improvement in the OS was observed in ICT trials using a cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (PF) combination 
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Although phase III ICT trials for HNSCC have demonstrated a stronger overall response and survival rate for a docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (TPF) combination compared with a PF combination

 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, randomized trials of CCRT preceded or not preceded by ICT TPF have not yet supported the use of ICT
