<p id="p0015">Although the role of ICT in managing HNSCC is still being explored and debated, it is used as a common clinical treatment for HNSCC. The potential clinical advantages of ICT in addition to organ-function preservation 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> are to provide early symptom and function improvement before RT, rapidly shrink tumors and, thus, reduce the requirement for urgent interventions (e.g., tracheostomy for airway obstruction, feeding tube for swallowing dysfunction), bridge definitive treatment when immediate RT initiation is not possible, eradicate micrometastasis, and inÂ vivo assess the treatment response to provide prognostic information for subsequent treatment. These potential advantages are commonly required for treating patients with advanced HNSCC, and ICT is reported to render a survival benefit in patients with unresectable HNSCC 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, according to the preceding considerations, patients with advanced tumors or a compromised health status for CCRT may be treated with ICT during daily practice. The 3-year OS of our patients with advanced-stage pharyngeal or laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (PLSCC) treated with CCRT and ICT was 60% and 45%, respectively. Whether the inferior outcome of ICT in daily practice is attributable to treatment selection bias requires clarification.
