<p id="p0130">In addition to the preclusion of post-ICT RT, the CT regimen used for post-ICT CCRT is another concern in managing advanced HNSCC. Although various strategies including RT alone, CCRT with various CT regimens, and bio-RT with cetuximab have been used in the post-ICT TPF setting

 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, the optimal strategy, particularly a strategy with lower morbidity, requires further investigation. Cisplatin-based CCRT is the most commonly advised practice

 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The cutoff point of 200 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> for the accumulated dose of cisplatin during RT has been proposed to be a factor on OS in HNSCC by retrospective reviews 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. This proposition was also supported in our trial. An accumulated dose of cisplatin &lt;150 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> (3 cycles of PUL) correlated with poorer PFS and LRC in multivariate analysis and was more common in the ICT/CCRT arm (46.8% vs 16.2%;

Although the issue of the cisplatin dose intensity during RT has not yet been proved by a precise trial, supportive care assisting patients in completing treatment per the established protocol is essential for favorable outcomes. The similar toxicity profiles during CCRT between the 2 arms might due to the nonadherence to the protocol occurred because of adverse events or poor patient compliance.
