<p id="p0120">The PUL regimen was considered less intensive compared with PF and TPF, and it may result in a less favorable outcome. A general consensus that emerged from phase III ICT trials is that the TPF regimen is more active than PF and is the current standard ICT regimen for HNSCC

 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, randomized trials of CCRT preceded or not preceded by ICT TPF still have not yet supported the use of ICT

 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The 3-year OS of 60% in the CCRT arm was determined according to our historical cohort data and the available scientific literature when the study was designed, and a 3-year OS of 56.0% in the ICT/CCRT arm and 60.4% in the CCRT arm was achieved. The controversial role of ICT in the management of HNSCC may not be due to variations in the PF-based regimen; the biological disadvantages of ICT may be the essential obstacle to attaining superior outcomes. Furthermore, pharmacoethnic analyses demonstrated that studies in Asia revealed an approximate 19-fold higher risk of docetaxel-induced severe neutropenia compared with non-Asian studies
