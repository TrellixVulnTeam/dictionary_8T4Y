<p id="p0140">We acknowledge the limitations in our analysis; specifically, our results were confounded because of premature enrollment closure and an unbalanced distribution of hypopharyngeal primary tumors and N2 and N3 disease. We demonstrated that ICT/CCRT yielded similar OS to that of CCRT, but suboptimal post-ICT CCRT resulted in poorer PFS and LRC in patients treated with ICT. The ICT strategy should be restricted to patients with the potential to benefit, such as those with unresectable disease and candidates for organ preservation, and effort to support patients in completing RT or CCRT protocols is essential.</p>
