<p id="p0125">The major determinants for improving survival in HNSCC patients treated with sequential strategy mainly through CCRT 
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. CCRT preceded by ICT delivers a heavier therapeutic loading to patients. ICT may affect the compliance of patients or even preclude subsequent major therapy. Our multivariate analysis revealed that a radiation dose &lt;70 Gy was an independent predictor of poorer OS, PFS, and LRC. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the percentage of patients not receiving the complete treatment protocol was 25% in the ICT/CCRT arm and 11% in the CCRT arm. The incidence of this negative effect was 20%–30% in the ICT/CCRT arm and 12% in the CCRT arm in phase III trials
