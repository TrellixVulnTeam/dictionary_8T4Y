<p id="p0105">This trial was suspended prematurely in 2011 because of slow accrual and poor end points in the ICT/CCRT arm during interim analysis. With insufficient statistical power, the OS in the ICT/CCRT arm was not poorer than that in the CCRT arm in patients with advanced PLSCC. However, patients treated with ICT/CCRT had poorer PFS and LRC.</p>
