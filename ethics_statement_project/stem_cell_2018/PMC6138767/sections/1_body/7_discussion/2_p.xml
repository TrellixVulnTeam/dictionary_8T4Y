<p id="p0110">The higher prevalence of hypopharynx cancer (57.1% vs 40.5%, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.09) and N2 or N3 disease (85.7% vs 74.4%, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02) in the ICT/CCRT arm may account for the poorer PFS and LRC. The 5-year OS of our patients and those in the Taiwan Cancer Registry treated between 2004 and 2010 was 100% and 43% for those with stage III oropharyngeal cancer, 65% and 31% for those with stage IV oropharyngeal cancer, 75% and 37% for those with stage III hypopharyngeal cancer, and 33% and 23% for those with stage IV hypopharyngeal cancer, respectively 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. These findings evidence that stage IV disease and non-oropharyngeal cancer are prognostic factors for a poorer outcome. A randomized study with stratification of the cancer site may be needed for refining the outcome assessments.
