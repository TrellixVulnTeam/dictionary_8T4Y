<p id="p0115">Although the incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related site HNSCC (1.3 per 100,000 in 1995 to 3.3 per 100,000 in 2009, annual percentage change (APC) 56.9, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) increased more rapidly than did the incidence of HPV-unrelated site HNSCC (10.4 per 100,000 in 1995 to 21.7 per 100,000 in 2009, APC 55.0, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) in Taiwan 
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, the HPV detection rate in patients with oropharyngeal cancer was 16.4% (45/274) in a Taiwan study and estimated to be 13%–17% in another study; these values are much lower than those in Western countries

 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Because of early termination and funding restrictions, it was not feasible to retrospectively collect data and materials for HPV analysis of our patients, and similar distributions of oropharyngeal cancer in the 2 arms may not support the effect of HPV-related problems on the outcome. However, the low HPV prevalence may account for the lower 3-year OS of the ICT/CCRT (47%) and CCRT (58%) arms compared with that reported in Western literature (75%)
