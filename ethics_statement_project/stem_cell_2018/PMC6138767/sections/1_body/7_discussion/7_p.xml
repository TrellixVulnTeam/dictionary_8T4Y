<p id="p0135">Neoadjuvant CT for advanced HNSCC management is controversial. Subgroup analysis of a phase III trial revealed a survival benefit in patients with unresectable disease 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In this trial, 36 patients had unresectable disease. Although an analysis of the entire population revealed poorer PFS and LRC in the ICT/CCRT arm, analysis of patients with unresectable disease revealed no difference in OS (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.893), PFS (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.629), LRC (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.226), or DM (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.817) between the study arms. Further investigation of ICT can focus on patients with unresectable disease who require early symptom management and function improvement before CCRT.
