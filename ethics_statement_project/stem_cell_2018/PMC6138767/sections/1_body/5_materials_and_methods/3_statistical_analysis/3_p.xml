<p id="p0070">All time-to-event end points were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Adverse events were analyzed in a safety population administered randomly assigned treatments. Fisher's exact test was used to compare binary and categorical variables. Continuous measurements were compared using independent sample 
 <italic>t</italic> tests. Kaplanâ€“Meier curves were used for determining time-to-event data. Time-to-event intervals were compared between groups by using log-rank tests and a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. The variables in multivariate analysis were sex; performance status; primary tumor location; pathologic differentiation; T, N, and, overall stages; resectability; radiation dose; total dose of cisplatin during CCRT; and the CT arm. All statistical computations were performed using SPSS software, version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
