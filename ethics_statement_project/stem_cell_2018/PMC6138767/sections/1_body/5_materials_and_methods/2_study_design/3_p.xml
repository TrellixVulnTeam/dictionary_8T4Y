<p id="p0045">External beam RT with a 6-MV X-ray was administered using intensity-modulated radiotherapy techniques. Patients received 2.0 Gy/d daily fractions 5 times per week. The gross target volume (GTV) was determined according to the clinical findings of nasofiberscopy, magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scans. The initial prophylactic clinical target volume included neck lymphatics at risk and margins at least 1 cm beyond the GTV, and was delivered a dose of 46–50 Gy. The radiation field was then reduced to the GTV with 0.5-cm margins and the initial grossly involved nodal area, and was delivered 70–76 Gy. The maximal dose was restricted to 50 Gy and 60 Gy for the spinal cord and brain stem, respectively. The mean dose for parotid sparing was restricted to 23 Gy, and the dose delivered to uninvolved constrict muscles was restricted to 56 Gy, when possible.</p>
