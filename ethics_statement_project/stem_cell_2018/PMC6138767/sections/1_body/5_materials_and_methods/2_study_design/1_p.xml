<p id="p0035">This randomized phase II trial compared ICT/CCRT with CCRT. The PUL regimen was administered biweekly during ICT and CCRT. Eligible patients were stratified into 4 groups on the basis of 2 factors: tumor resectability (resectable vs unresectable) and disease stage (III vs IV). A consensus on resectability was provided by a multidisciplinary team. Randomization codes were generated independently for each stratum. A permuted block randomization scheme was used to generate the randomization codes so that the number of patients assigned to the 2 treatment arms was approximately equal. The institutional review board of our institution approved this study. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before therapy.</p>
