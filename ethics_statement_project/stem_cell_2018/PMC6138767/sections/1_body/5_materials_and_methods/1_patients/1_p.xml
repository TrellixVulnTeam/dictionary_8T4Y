<p id="p0030">Patients with measurable nonmetastatic histologically proven stage III or IV PLSCC were eligible if either their tumors were declared unresectable by a multidisciplinary team consensus or they were candidates for organ preservation. The American Joint Committee on Cancer criteria (2002) were used for disease staging 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The included patients were aged 18–70 years, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0–2, and adequate bone marrow function (leukocyte count ≥ 4000/L; platelets ≥ 100,000/L), renal function (serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL), and liver function (total bilirubin ≤1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN); serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ≤ 2.5 × the ULN). Exclusion criteria were a previous history of malignancy, prior CT or RT, serious concomitant illness (e.g., liver cirrhosis, angina, or myocardial disease), uncontrolled infection and intestinal obstruction, malabsorption, and any condition that restricted oral medication. Patients fed through nasogastric tubes or gastrostomy tubes without intestinal malabsorption or obstruction were eligible.
