    <title>Scientific background on the subject</title>

    <title>What this study adds to the field</title>
    <p id="p0020a">This study showed that ICT/CCRT and CCRT provides similar overall survival, but poorer compliance to CCRT and inferior locoregional control and progression-free survival were observed in the ICT/CCRT arm. Optimizing the therapeutic ratio in both ICT and CCRT settings are necessary for developing a sequential strategy for advanced PLSCC.</p>
