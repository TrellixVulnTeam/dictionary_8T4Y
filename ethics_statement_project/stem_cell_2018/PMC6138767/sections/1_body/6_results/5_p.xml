<p id="p0095">In multivariate analyses (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), prognostic factors of OS included unresectable disease, stage IV disease, non-oropharyngeal primary tumors, and a radiation dose &lt; 70 Gy; stage IV disease, non-oropharyngeal primary tumors, a radiation dose &lt; 70 Gy, and total dose of cisplatin during CCRT &lt; 150 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> were associated with poorer PFS and LRC. Patients with an ECOG performance status of 2 or with hypopharyngeal tumors had an increased risk of DM. The treatment arm (ICT/CCRT vs CCRT) was not at a significant risk factor for time-to-event end points.
