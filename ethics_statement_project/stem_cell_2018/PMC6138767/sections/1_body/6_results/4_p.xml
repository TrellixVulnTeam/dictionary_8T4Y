<p id="p0090">Patients who received at least one cycle of PUL were included in the safety analysis (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The major grade 3–4 adverse event during ICT PUL was diarrhea (14.3%). Adverse events during CCRT in the ICT/CCRT and CCRT arms were neutropenia (12.0% and 12.1%, respectively), anemia (32.8% and 10.6%), stomatitis (70.7% and 59.1%), and dermatitis (12.0% and 15.1%). No difference was observed between the study arms regarding the parameters of compliance during RT. However, the proportion of patients receiving a total dose of cisplatin during CCRT &lt;150 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> was higher in the ICT/CCRT arm (46.8% vs 16.2%;

The radiotherapeutic dose was &lt;70 Gy in the ICT/CCRT arm because of death due to hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic coma (1 patient), bleeding (1 patient), infection (3 patients), fatigue (1 patient), and withdrawal of consent (1 patient) and in the CCRT arm because of death due to bleeding (1 patient), infection (5 patients), and withdrawal of consent (2 patients).
