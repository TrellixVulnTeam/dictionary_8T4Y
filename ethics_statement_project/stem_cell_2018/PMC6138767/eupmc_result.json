A cisplatin/tegafur-uracil/leucovorin regimen was administered during ICT and CCRT. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).<h4>Results</h4>We enrolled 151 patients during December 2006 to February 2011. The median follow-up of surviving patients was 54.5 months. The ICT/CCRT arm included more patients with hypopharynx cancer (57.1% vs 40.5%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.09) and N2 or N3 diseases (85.7% vs 74.4%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02).
