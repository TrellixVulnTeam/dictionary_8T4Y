Dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy is a promising alternative treatment strategy. A novel allogeneic DC vaccine, DCP-001, was developed from an AML-derived cell line that uniquely combines the positive features of allogeneic DC vaccines and expression of multi-leukemia-associated antigens. Here, we present data from a phase I study conducted with DCP-001 in 12 advanced-stage elderly AML patients. Patients enrolled were in complete remission (CR1/CR2) (n\u2009=\u20095) or had smoldering disease (n\u2009=\u20097). All patients were at high risk of relapse and ineligible for post-remission intensification therapies. A standard 3\u2009+\u20093 dose escalation design with extension to six patients in the highest dose was performed. Patients received four biweekly intradermal DCP-001 injections at different dose levels (10, 25, and 50\u00a0million cells DCP-001) and were monitored for clinical and immunological responses. Primary objectives of the study (feasibility and safety) were achieved with 10/12 patients completing the vaccination program. Treatment was well tolerated. A clear-cut distinction between patients with and without detectable circulating leukemic blasts during the vaccination period was noted. Patients with no circulating blasts showed an unusually prolonged survival [median overall survival 36 months (range 7-63) from\u00a0the start\u00a0of vaccination] whereas patients with circulating blasts, died within 6\u00a0months. Long-term survival was correlated with maintained T cell levels and induction of multi-functional immune responses. It is concluded that DCP-001 in elderly AML patients is safe, feasible and generates both cellular and humoral immune responses.", "affiliation": "Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Clinical Trial, Phase I", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "IK10085", "agency": "Innovatiekrediet", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "PTO951.10.106", "agency": "ZonMW translational program", "orderIn": "0"}]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Dendritic Cells", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "IM", "qualifierName": "immunology", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "IM", "qualifierName": "immunology", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Cancer Vaccines", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "AD", "qualifierName": "administration & dosage", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "IM", "qualifierName": "immunology", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Immunotherapy"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Remission Induction"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Aged"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Female"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Male"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "IM", "qualifierName": "immunology", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "PC", "qualifierName": "prevention & control", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Dendritic cells", "Acute myeloid leukemia", "immune therapy", "Phase I Trial"]}, "chemicalList": {"chemical": {"name": "Cancer Vaccines", "registryNumber": "0"}}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00262-018-2198-9"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6182404"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6182404?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "19", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2018-10-12", "dateOfCreation": "2018-07-25", "firstIndexDate": "2018-07-25", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-10", "dateOfRevision": "2018-11-14", "electronicPublicationDate": "2018-07-23", "firstPublicationDate": "2018-07-23"}, "htmllinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6182404", "abstract": "In elderly acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients post-remission treatment options are associated with high comorbidity rates and poor survival.
