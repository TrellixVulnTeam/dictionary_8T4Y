Dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy is a promising alternative treatment strategy. A novel allogeneic DC vaccine, DCP-001, was developed from an AML-derived cell line that uniquely combines the positive features of allogeneic DC vaccines and expression of multi-leukemia-associated antigens. Here, we present data from a phase I study conducted with DCP-001 in 12 advanced-stage elderly AML patients. Patients enrolled were in complete remission (CR1/CR2) (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5) or had smoldering disease (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7). All patients were at high risk of relapse and ineligible for post-remission intensification therapies. A standard 3&#x02009;+&#x02009;3 dose escalation design with extension to six patients in the highest dose was performed. Patients received four biweekly intradermal DCP-001 injections at different dose levels (10, 25, and 50&#x000a0;million cells DCP-001) and were monitored for clinical and immunological responses. Primary objectives of the study (feasibility and safety) were achieved with 10/12 patients completing the vaccination program. Treatment was well tolerated. A clear-cut distinction between patients with and without detectable circulating leukemic blasts during the vaccination period was noted. Patients with no circulating blasts showed an unusually prolonged survival [median overall survival 36 months (range 7&#x02013;63) from&#x000a0;the start&#x000a0;of vaccination] whereas patients with circulating blasts, died within 6&#x000a0;months. Long-term survival was correlated with maintained T cell levels and induction of multi-functional immune responses. It is concluded that DCP-001 in elderly AML patients is safe, feasible and generates both cellular and humoral immune responses.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1007/s00262-018-2198-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Dendritic cells</kwd><kwd>Immune therapy</kwd><kwd>Acute myeloid leukemia</kwd><kwd>Phase I trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>ZonMW translational program</institution></funding-source><award-id>PTO951.10.106</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Innovatiekrediet</institution></funding-source><award-id>IK10085</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kruisbeek</surname><given-names>Ada M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par19">Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) most commonly affects the elderly population with a median age of around 67&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Current AML treatment relies largely on intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which is unsuccessful in 60&#x02013;80% of patients due to persistence of measurable residual disease (MRD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Particularly in elderly patients, these strategies are associated with high comorbidity rates and the 5-year overall survival in this population remains poor (10&#x02013;15% in patients&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;65). Therefore, new treatment strategies are urgently needed.</p><p id="Par20">Immunotherapeutic approaches aiming to eradicate MRD through activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL), contribute to improved disease outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Such anti-leukemia CTL are most effectively primed by the most powerful antigen-presenting cell identified to date, i.e., the dendritic cell (DC). Clinical trials have shown that DC vaccination is safe, has hardly any side effects and induces immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, autologous DC vaccination is cumbersome, costly and logistically complex. Moreover, clinical efficacy has proven limited, most probably due to the fact that most trials were performed with single-antigen-loaded DC. As an alternative, the use of autologous or allogeneic whole tumor cell lysates or tumor-derived peptide pools as a source of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) for DC loading has been extensively explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These formulations cover a wide range of both uncharacterized and characterized tumor antigens, thereby reducing the chance of post-vaccination immune escape. Unfortunately, feasibility was often limited by availability of sufficient numbers of autologous or allogeneic tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Allogeneic DCs have been reported to induce stronger antigen-specific immune responses than autologous DC because they trigger a broader CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immune repertoire, including tumor reactive T cells, and a broad inflammatory response by polyclonal stimulation of allogeneic T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The indirect antigen presentation route by host DCs and strong Th1 cell differentiation and activation in response to allo-antigens, will add to the T cell-mediated antitumor response.</p><p id="Par22">A novel DC vaccine, DCP-001, was developed that uniquely combines the positive features of allogeneic DC vaccines and multi-antigen-expressing tumor cell vaccines. DCP-001 consists of mature DC generated through differentiation and maturation of the AML cell line DCOne and as such harbors AML-associated antigens.</p><p id="Par23">Here, we report the results of a phase-I safety and feasibility trial of DCP-001 vaccination in advanced-stage elderly AML patients ineligible for standard post-remission therapies. Besides clinical safety, the results demonstrate biological efficacy of the vaccine with the induction of both specific T cell and humoral responses. Moreover, clinical efficacy is suggested by an unexpectedly sustainable clinical benefit observed in five out of the twelve enrolled patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and patient inclusion</title><p id="Par24">A phase I feasibility and safety trial was conducted from March 2011 to March 2013.

Importantly, induced antibody responses against autologous blasts were also observed in two out of three evaluable patients (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c), which demonstrates the induction of immunity against autologous AML blasts by the allogeneic DCP001.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>DTH reactivity</title><p id="Par54">In the DTH tests, 5 of 11 evaluable patients had an increase of &#x02265;&#x02009;50% in the mean diameter of induration at day 51 compared to baseline, indicating DCP-001-induced T cell response (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Importantly, no reactivity to the Cryostor vehicle control was ever observed (data not shown). Of the 7 patients who did not have an increase at day 51 compared to baseline, all showed a baseline reaction of at least 4&#x000a0;mm (range 3.5&#x02013;15&#x000a0;mm) which points to a pre-existing immunity to components of the DCP-001. This could be an allo-reaction but also a response to TAAs in the vaccine. Evidence for vaccination-induced increases in DTH reactivity was mostly found among long-term (&#x0003e;&#x02009;6 months) survivors (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p id="Par55">Immunohistochemical assessment of DTH punch biopsies was performed for T cell and DC influx in 9 out of 12 patients at day 2 and day 51 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). All of these patients showed an increased influx of activated T cells in response to the vaccine as compared to the Cryostor vehicle control in both the superficial and deep dermis and to a similar extent at d2 (pre-vaccination) and d51 (post-vaccination) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;3). Irrespective of the dosage used, DCP-001 vaccination also resulted in increased TIA or Granzyme B-positive cytotoxic T cell infiltration in individual cases (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;3a). No CD56<sup>+</sup> NK cell infiltration was observed. In addition, a selective increase of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD45RO<sup>+</sup> infiltrate (in particular in the higher dose levels) in the superficial dermis was observed at the DCP-001 delivery site that may point to a more active effector-memory Th-cell compartment after vaccination (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;3b).</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>T cell reactivity to DCP-001 and its DCOne progenitors by MLR</title><p id="Par56">The proliferative T cell capacity in response to DCP-001 and DCOne progenitor cells was analyzed in 9/12 patients.

Particularly in older patients, who are not eligible for post-remission intensification treatments such as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, overall survival rates are dismal (15&#x02013;20% at 2&#x000a0;years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Successful immunotherapy can offer long-term protection against outgrowth of MRD through the activity of memory T cells that can specifically recognize and eliminate leukemic blasts. That this may present an effective treatment option is supported by the apparent dependence of the efficacy of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation on the graft&#x02013;versus&#x02013;leukemia effect, mediated by T cell immunity against histocompatibility-mismatched leukemic blasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Unfortunately, transplantation-associated graft&#x02013;versus&#x02013;host disease is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality in patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In AML, DC-based vaccines have, therefore, been clinically explored as an alternative means of kick starting cell-mediated immunity against leukemia.</p><p id="Par61">Previous clinically tested AML-targeted DC vaccines have mostly consisted of autologous monocyte-derived DC, either loaded with single-antigen-derived peptides or mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] or autologous AML blast lysates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], fused to autologous AML blasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], or derived from autologous blasts that were differentiated into DC-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. These approaches have led to varying levels of clinical efficacy with reports of dropping peripheral blast counts and prolonged overall survival in treated individual patients. Approaches employing autologous blasts rely on TAAs and neo-antigens selectively expressed in autologous tumors and provide a poly-epitope-based personalized vaccine that can trigger both Th, CTL and humoral immunity. A disadvantage of this personalized approach is the laborious and costly vaccine production process and its inherent variability in quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. As AML has a low mutational burden resulting in an expected low number of neo-epitopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], vaccination efficacy will most likely depend on shared common TAAs. As such a strong case can be made for an allogeneic DC-based approach that can offer a highly standardized off-the-shelf platform.</p><p>DCP-001 expresses a range of shared TAAs and HLA haplotypes that together cover more than 70% of the Caucasian population. It presents a highly potent, standardized and fully scalable vaccine platform that is widely applicable. Here, data of a phase-I trial of DCP-001 vaccination in elderly AML patients in CR1/CR2 or with smoldering disease are presented. The vaccine proved safe and a treatment regimen of four biweekly i.d. DCP-001 injections was feasible, thus meeting the primary objectives of the study. The obtained results further suggest that in patients with demonstrable immune competence and maintained peripheral T cell rates, DCP-001 can induce a multi-functional immune response to the vaccine, its AML progenitors, common shared leukemia-associated antigens (LAA), as well as to antigens in autologous leukemic blasts. Although the study size is too small to draw definitive conclusions, the observed immune responses may have translated into a long-term clinical benefit in those patients who were in CR at the time of vaccination, and therefore, would have been in a less immune-suppressed state. Typically, the inclusion criteria employed in this trial would select for patients with an average life expectancy of 3&#x02013;6 months&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. It is, therefore, remarkable that 6 of the 12 enrolled patients in this trial survived for more than 6 months after start of treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, median overall survival 36 months), with one patient still alive at the time of writing. Clearly, the small number of patients enrolled in this trial with as primary endpoint safety and feasibility does not allow for firm conclusions with regards to clinical outcome. As such, the results from this trial should be regarded as hypothesis generating. The hypothesis that DCP-001 induces immune responses against the patient&#x02019;s leukemic blasts, translating into clinical benefit in immune competent patients who are in CR at the time of vaccination, will now be investigated in a multi-center randomized phase II trial in AML patients in CR1.</p><p id="Par63">As a secondary objective, DCP-001-induced immune responses were assessed. Allogeneic DC vaccines have been shown to induce and support antitumor immunity in part through generation of allo-response-induced pro-inflammatory conditions conducive to Th1 skewing and in part through the direct priming of tumor-reactive or cross-reactive T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The observed induction of DTH responses against the vaccine and increased post-vaccination DTH reactivity in five of the tested patients are in line with the induction and boosting of systemic Th1 responses. Both CD4 and activated (based on a rise in Granzyme B and TIA expression) CD8 T cell responses were induced, as judged by immunohistochemistry analyses of biopsies taken from the DTH site. Results from in vitro proliferation assays with pre- and post-vaccination T cells in response to DCP-001 were in line with these observations. Vaccination-induced proliferative responses were noted upon in vitro restimulation in six out of nine patients, which may have included responses to both allogeneic and tumor-associated antigens. These DCP-001-induced T cell responses were marked by increased release of Th1 cytokines, either alone or combined with the release of Th2 and Th17 cytokines. The observation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferative responses to DCP-001 progenitors in five patients further indicated the induction of effector T cells able to respond to leukemic blasts lacking high levels of costimulatory molecules. Vaccination-induced or enhanced T cell responses to WT-1, PRAME, NY-ESO-1, and MAGE-A3 were observed in 4 out of 8 evaluable patients in this study. Whereas WT-1 and PRAME are expressed by DCP-001, NY-ESO-1 and MAGE-A3 are not. This suggests that T cell responses may have been both directly primed or re-stimulated by DCP-001 (or after cross-presentation of its contents), or indirectly through bystander activation and/or epitope spreading. Overall, these results demonstrate the development of cell-mediated immune responses to vaccination at all doses tested. Finally, also induction of humoral responses were observed to DCP-001, its progenitors and importantly, also to autologous leukemic blasts. The latter unequivocally demonstrates the induction of immunity against autologous AML blasts by the allogeneic DCP-001.</p><p id="Par64">DCP-001-induced immune responses were observed in patients from all cohorts and not restricted to the higher dose levels. Overall T cell reactivity (expressed as &#x02018;T cell score&#x02019;, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) was significantly higher in long-term survivors (&#x0003e;&#x02009;6 months). Though more patients would be needed for conclusive evidence, this is suggestive of a causal relationship between DCP-001-induced antitumor immunity and clinical outcome. Of note, patients with a maintained low blast count were more likely to develop an immune response to the vaccine, advocating the testing of such immunotherapies in patients with less advanced stages of disease.</p><p id="Par65">In conclusion, DCP-001 vaccination in elderly AML patients is safe, feasible and leads to the induction or boosting of multifunctional antitumor immunity. In patients with CR and stable peripheral T cell rate-prolonged overall survival was observed (median 36 months). These promising data warrant further testing of this allogeneic off-the-shelf DC vaccine in AML patients in post-chemotherapy complete remission either as monotherapy or in combination with hypomethylating agents or immune checkpoint inhibitors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec29"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
