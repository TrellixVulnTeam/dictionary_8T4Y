  <p>Immune responses induced by the DCP-001. Representative examples are shown of poly-functional immune responses elicited by DCP-001 vaccination. Pre- and post-vaccination T cell responses after in vitro restimulation in an IFNγ ELISpot read-out against 
   <bold>a</bold> WT-1 and PRAME in patient 012 and against 
   <bold>b</bold> NY-ESO-1 and MAGE-A3 in patient 015. 
   <bold>c</bold> Examples of enhanced (closed arrows) and de novo serological responses post-vaccination against DCOne progenitor and autologous AML blast lysates in patient 006. 
   <bold>d</bold> Examples of CD4, CD8, and Gr-B immunohistochemical staining of immune infiltrates in the dermis of DCP-001 DTH biopsies pre- and post-vaccination (magnification ×100). 
   <bold>e</bold> Proliferation (by CFSE dilution read-out) of CD4
   <sup>+</sup> or CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells from peripheral blood (013), pre- (
   <italic>t</italic> = 0) and post-vaccination (
   <italic>t</italic> = 49 or 126 days), against DCP-001 mature DC (top panels), or their DCOne progenitors (bottom left panel) or IFNγ release in response to DCP-001 (right bottom panel); autologous monocytes served as non-tumor controls.
