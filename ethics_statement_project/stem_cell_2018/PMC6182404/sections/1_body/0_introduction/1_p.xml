<p id="Par19">Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) most commonly affects the elderly population with a median age of around 67 years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Current AML treatment relies largely on intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which is unsuccessful in 60–80% of patients due to persistence of measurable residual disease (MRD) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Particularly in elderly patients, these strategies are associated with high comorbidity rates and the 5-year overall survival in this population remains poor (10–15% in patients &gt; 65). Therefore, new treatment strategies are urgently needed.
