<p id="Par23">Here, we report the results of a phase-I safety and feasibility trial of DCP-001 vaccination in advanced-stage elderly AML patients ineligible for standard post-remission therapies. Besides clinical safety, the results demonstrate biological efficacy of the vaccine with the induction of both specific T cell and humoral responses. Moreover, clinical efficacy is suggested by an unexpectedly sustainable clinical benefit observed in five out of the twelve enrolled patients.</p>
