 <sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL), contribute to improved disease outcome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Such anti-leukemia CTL are most effectively primed by the most powerful antigen-presenting cell identified to date, i.e., the dendritic cell (DC). Clinical trials have shown that DC vaccination is safe, has hardly any side effects and induces immune responses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, autologous DC vaccination is cumbersome, costly and logistically complex. Moreover, clinical efficacy has proven limited, most probably due to the fact that most trials were performed with single-antigen-loaded DC. As an alternative, the use of autologous or allogeneic whole tumor cell lysates or tumor-derived peptide pools as a source of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) for DC loading has been extensively explored [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These formulations cover a wide range of both uncharacterized and characterized tumor antigens, thereby reducing the chance of post-vaccination immune escape. Unfortunately, feasibility was often limited by availability of sufficient numbers of autologous or allogeneic tumor cells [
