<p id="Par21">Allogeneic DCs have been reported to induce stronger antigen-specific immune responses than autologous DC because they trigger a broader CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell immune repertoire, including tumor reactive T cells, and a broad inflammatory response by polyclonal stimulation of allogeneic T cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The indirect antigen presentation route by host DCs and strong Th1 cell differentiation and activation in response to allo-antigens, will add to the T cell-mediated antitumor response.
