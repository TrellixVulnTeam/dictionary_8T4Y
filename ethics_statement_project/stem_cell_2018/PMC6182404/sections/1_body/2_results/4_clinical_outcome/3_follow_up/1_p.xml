<p id="Par45">The study was formally completed in March 2013 but all patients were clinically followed until death. At present (December 2017) one patient is still alive. Based on the presence or absence of circulating leukemic blasts patients could be divided into two groups, which corresponded to short-(≤ 6 months, median overall survival 3 months, range 2–6 months) and long-term survivors (&gt; 6 months, median overall survival 36 months, range 7–63 months), respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The two groups showed strikingly different patterns in peripheral leukemic blast and T cell counts during treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Patients with detectable peripheral blast died within 6 months post-treatment (short-term survivors). Patients without detectable leukemic blasts in peripheral blood (or rapidly dropping below the detection threshold) showed remarkably prolonged survival (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a), with one patient still alive at the time of writing and 64 months after study entry and the other patients surviving for 7, 36, 22, 63, and 36 months (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Long-term survival was accompanied by maintained levels of T cells. In patients with short-term survival and detectable circulating blasts, T cell levels dropped precipitously (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b).
