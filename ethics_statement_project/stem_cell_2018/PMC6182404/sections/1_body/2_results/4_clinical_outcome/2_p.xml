<p id="Par44">Six out of 12 patients were in CR (i.e., undetectable AML blasts in blood and &lt; 5% in bone marrow) at study end and 5/12 experienced persistent disease (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). All patients, except for one, who were in CR at end of study, were in CR1 or CR2 at baseline. All but one of the patients with smoldering disease at study entry, had persistent disease at the end of the study (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). One patient (001) with smoldering disease reached CR at the end of the study. This patient had circulating blast counts of 0.05 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L and bone marrow blasts of 7% at baseline. No clear relationship between clinical outcome and administered DCP-001 dose was apparent.
