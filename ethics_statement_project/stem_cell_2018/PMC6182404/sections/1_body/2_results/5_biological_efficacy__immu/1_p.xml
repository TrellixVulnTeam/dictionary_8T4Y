<p id="Par47">Immune monitoring was performed to evaluate DCP-001 vaccination-induced immune responses and to identify possible relationships to clinical outcome. Patients with detectable blasts at study entry (002, 005, 006, 012, and 014) experienced rapidly dropping T cell frequencies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b) which excluded the possibility to perform all in vitro T cell-based assay in some cases and to draw clear conclusions on immune responses between the two groups. An overview of T cell-related immune data pre- and post-vaccination (day 0, day 49 and day 126) is summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and are further explained below.
