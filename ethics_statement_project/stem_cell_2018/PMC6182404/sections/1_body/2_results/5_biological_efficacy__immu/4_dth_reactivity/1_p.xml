<p id="Par54">In the DTH tests, 5 of 11 evaluable patients had an increase of ≥ 50% in the mean diameter of induration at day 51 compared to baseline, indicating DCP-001-induced T cell response (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Importantly, no reactivity to the Cryostor vehicle control was ever observed (data not shown). Of the 7 patients who did not have an increase at day 51 compared to baseline, all showed a baseline reaction of at least 4 mm (range 3.5–15 mm) which points to a pre-existing immunity to components of the DCP-001. This could be an allo-reaction but also a response to TAAs in the vaccine. Evidence for vaccination-induced increases in DTH reactivity was mostly found among long-term (&gt; 6 months) survivors (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).
