<p id="Par48">The HLA type of DCP-001 is HLA-A2,3, -B44, -DRB1:10,11 and -DQB1:05‚03. HLA matches varied from 1 to 5 but the number of (mis)matches showed no clear relationship with survival (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). None of the patients showed a full mismatch, i.e., not expressing any of the DCP-001 HLA alleles (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Moreover, no correlations between degree of HLA match and observed immune responses were found.
