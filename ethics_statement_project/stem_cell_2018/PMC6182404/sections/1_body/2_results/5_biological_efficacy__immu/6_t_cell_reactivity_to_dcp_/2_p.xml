<p id="Par57">CBA analysis further showed a measurable IFNγ response against DCP-001 in 5/9 patients (for a representative result, see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e), accompanied by IL-2 release in three cases. In two additional patients, also post-vaccination IL-4, IL-6, IL-17 or IL-10 responses were detected (Supplementary Fig. 5). These results demonstrate the induction of Th1 or mixed Th1/Th2/Th17 responses by DCP-001.
