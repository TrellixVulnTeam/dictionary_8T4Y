<p id="Par56">The proliferative T cell capacity in response to DCP-001 and DCOne progenitor cells was analyzed in 9/12 patients. Seven of these patients showed pre-existent T cell responses (proliferation rate ≥ 20%), as is to be expected for an allogeneic vaccine. Increased proliferative responses (either CD4 or CD8) against DCP-001 cells and/or DCOne progenitor cells upon vaccination were observed in 6/9 evaluable patients (Table

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e), whereas in none of the patients reactivity to autologous monocytes was observed. Notably, in five cases, increased post-vaccination reactivity to DCOne progenitors was observed, which almost exclusively involved CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (data not shown). This observation is highly suggestive for the induction of a CD8
 <sup>+</sup> effector T cell response to AML blasts.
