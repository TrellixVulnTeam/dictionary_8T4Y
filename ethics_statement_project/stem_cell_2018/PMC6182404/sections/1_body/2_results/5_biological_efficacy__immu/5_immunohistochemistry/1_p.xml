<p id="Par55">Immunohistochemical assessment of DTH punch biopsies was performed for T cell and DC influx in 9 out of 12 patients at day 2 and day 51 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). All of these patients showed an increased influx of activated T cells in response to the vaccine as compared to the Cryostor vehicle control in both the superficial and deep dermis and to a similar extent at d2 (pre-vaccination) and d51 (post-vaccination) (Supplementary Fig. 3). Irrespective of the dosage used, DCP-001 vaccination also resulted in increased TIA or Granzyme B-positive cytotoxic T cell infiltration in individual cases (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d and Supplementary Fig. 3a). No CD56
 <sup>+</sup> NK cell infiltration was observed. In addition, a selective increase of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD45RO
 <sup>+</sup> infiltrate (in particular in the higher dose levels) in the superficial dermis was observed at the DCP-001 delivery site that may point to a more active effector-memory Th-cell compartment after vaccination (Supplementary Fig. 3b).
