<p id="Par58">Patient 001 received two booster vaccinations of 10 million DCP-001 cells 13.5 months after initial treatment. Remarkably, whereas this patient did not show DCP-001-induced immune reactivity after the first four vaccinations, after receiving the booster vaccination she developed de novo antibody responses both to her autologous leukemic blasts and to DCOne progenitors (Supplementary Fig. 4) as well as proliferative CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses against the DCP-001 (Table
