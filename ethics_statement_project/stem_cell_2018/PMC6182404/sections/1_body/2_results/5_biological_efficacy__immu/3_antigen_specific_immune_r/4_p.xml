<p id="Par53">Antibody responses generated against DCOne progenitor and autologous blast antigens was evaluated in 10/12 patients. Five patients showed an increased response with bands gaining in intensity or new bands appearing on the blots, denoting vaccination-induced humoral responses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). Specificity of the responses, in terms of the identity of the recognized antigens, remains to be determined. Importantly, induced antibody responses against autologous blasts were also observed in two out of three evaluable patients (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c), which demonstrates the induction of immunity against autologous AML blasts by the allogeneic DCP001.
