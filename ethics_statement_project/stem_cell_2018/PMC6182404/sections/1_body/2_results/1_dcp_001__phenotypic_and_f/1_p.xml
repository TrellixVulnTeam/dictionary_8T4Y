<p id="Par39">DCP-001 consists of mature DC differentiated from the AML cell line DCOne which expresses multiple TAAs (e.g., WT-1, PRAME, data not shown). In addition, DCP-001 cells display high expression levels of CD1a, langerin, a wide range of costimulatory molecules, and MHC class I/II molecules (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). The manufactured DCP-001 batches passed QC release tests, including sterility and endotoxin level (&lt; 5 EU/mL). Cell number, viability, phenotypic expression and potency (migration, MLR) were evaluated directly after thawing. DCP-001 cells displayed a consistent ability to prime allogeneic T cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) and to migrate in response to the chemokines 6Ckine and MIP3β (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c), both involved in homing to the paracortical T cell areas of lymph nodes. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d depicts the phenotype used for QC release and demonstrates a very high consistency between the 3 independently produced clinical batches.
