<p id="Par41">DCP-001 vaccination was well tolerated, safe and feasible. Six patients experienced severe adverse events (SAE) during the study (002, 004, 005, 007, 011 and 014), only one (002) was judged to have a possible relationship to study treatment (diabetes insipidus). This could possibly represent a vaccine-induced autoimmune response. All others were considered unrelated or unlikely to be related to study treatment. Two patients died before completing the study due to pneumonia (005) and disease progression (014). Neither of these deaths were related to study treatment. Two patients discontinued study treatment (see above); SAEs in patients 004 (myocardial infarct) and 007 (vasovagal collapse) did not lead to discontinuation and both patients in fact proved to be long-term survivors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The distribution of AEs between cohorts was uneven but there was no trend suggesting a dose–response relationship for AE occurrence. AEs were of CTC grade 1 or 2 and most were judged as unrelated to study treatment. The most common AEs were injection site reactions (6 patients), anemia (4 patients), thrombocytopenia (3 patients), fatigue (3 patients), pain in extremity (3 patients), and nausea (3 patients).
