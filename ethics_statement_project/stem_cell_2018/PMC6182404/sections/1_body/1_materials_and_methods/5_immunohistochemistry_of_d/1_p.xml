<p id="Par33">Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed on biopsies taken from the DTH sites under local anesthesia. Biopsies were formalin-fixed/paraffin-embedded and stained with the following antibodies as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]: CD1a, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD83, DC-SIGN, Granzyme B, FoxP3, CD45RO, TIA, CD56 and langerin. Positively stained cell rates were assessed independently by two observers and classified as negative (−), low (±), moderate (+), high (++) or very high-infiltration rate (+++). In case of inconsistent results between the two observers, assessment by a third observer was carried out and subsequent consensus reached.
