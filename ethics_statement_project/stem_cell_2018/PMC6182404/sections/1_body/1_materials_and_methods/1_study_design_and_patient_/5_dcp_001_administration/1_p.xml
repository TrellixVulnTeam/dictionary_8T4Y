<p id="Par29">Patients received four biweekly intradermal (i.d.) DCP-001 vaccinations (2–4 four injections of 0.5 mL each) in the upper leg. The first cohort (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3; patient 001, 002, 004) received 10 million cells/vaccination, the second cohort (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3; patient 005, 006, 007) 25 million cells/vaccination, and the third cohort (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3 patient 008, 011, 012) received 50 million cells/vaccination. The third cohort was extended with three patients (patient 013, 014, 015). Delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions were measured in the lower arm. Of note, patient 001 received two booster vaccinations of 10 million cells, 13.5 months after the fourth vaccination (
 <italic>t</italic> = 0) at 2-week intervals. At this point as well as 21 and 70 days later, blood was drawn for immunomonitoring.
