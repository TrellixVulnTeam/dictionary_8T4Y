<p id="Par24">A phase I feasibility and safety trial was conducted from March 2011 to March 2013. The set-up followed a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design with extension to six patients in the highest non-toxic dose level. Main inclusion criteria were either AML in second complete remission (CR2), (relapsed) smoldering AML, or de novo AML in CR1, all not eligible for additional intensification therapy. Patient characteristics are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Exclusion criteria included uncontrolled active infection, previous immunotherapy in the last 3 months, and previous allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplantation. Patients received DCP-001 vaccinations at days 0, 14, 28 and 42. Skin testing was performed at days 2, 49 and 51. For immunomonitoring, samples were taken before first vaccination, 1 week after the fourth vaccination (day 49), and 12 weeks after the fourth vaccination (day 126). Subsequently, extended follow-up until death was performed to evaluate clinical outcome.
