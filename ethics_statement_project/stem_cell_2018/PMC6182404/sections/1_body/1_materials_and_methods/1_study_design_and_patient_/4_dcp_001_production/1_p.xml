<p id="Par27">DCP-001 was manufactured according to good manufacturing practice (GMP) regulations following previously described protocols [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In brief, the cells were cultured in a cocktail of GM-CSF, TNFα, and IL-4 in the presence of mitoxantrone to accelerate DC differentiation, followed by maturation in the presence of prostaglandin-E2, TNFα, and IL-1β. Quality control (QC) included microbiological controls and QC release tests for cell viability and number, phenotype (by flow cytometry, based on expression of CD1a, Langerin, and MHC and costimulatory markers), and potency through T cell priming in a mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR), and migration in response to the lymph node homing chemokines MIP3β and 6-CKine in a trans-well assay—all as described earlier [
