<p id="Par37">Vaccination-induced antibodies against DCOne progenitor and, if available, autologous blast lysates were measured in serum by western blot analysis using denaturing 7% SDSâ€“polyacrylamide gels and PVDF protein membranes (BioRad). Following blocking, the membranes were incubated with pre- and post-vaccination sera and HRP-conjugated anti-hIgG/A/M as secondary antibody (Dako). Blots were developed with chemoluminescence substrate (GE Healthcare). Increased intensity or appearance of new bands in Post-Vacc samples denoted DCP-001 vaccination-induced antibody responses.</p>
