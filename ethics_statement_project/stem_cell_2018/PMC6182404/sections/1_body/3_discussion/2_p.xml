<p id="Par61">Previous clinically tested AML-targeted DC vaccines have mostly consisted of autologous monocyte-derived DC, either loaded with single-antigen-derived peptides or mRNA [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] or autologous AML blast lysates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], fused to autologous AML blasts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], or derived from autologous blasts that were differentiated into DC-like cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. These approaches have led to varying levels of clinical efficacy with reports of dropping peripheral blast counts and prolonged overall survival in treated individual patients. Approaches employing autologous blasts rely on TAAs and neo-antigens selectively expressed in autologous tumors and provide a poly-epitope-based personalized vaccine that can trigger both Th, CTL and humoral immunity. A disadvantage of this personalized approach is the laborious and costly vaccine production process and its inherent variability in quality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. As AML has a low mutational burden resulting in an expected low number of neo-epitopes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], vaccination efficacy will most likely depend on shared common TAAs. As such a strong case can be made for an allogeneic DC-based approach that can offer a highly standardized off-the-shelf platform.
