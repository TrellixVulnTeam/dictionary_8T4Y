<p>Persistent MRD after induction chemotherapy poses a major challenge in the treatment of AML. Particularly in older patients, who are not eligible for post-remission intensification treatments such as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, overall survival rates are dismal (15–20% at 2 years) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Successful immunotherapy can offer long-term protection against outgrowth of MRD through the activity of memory T cells that can specifically recognize and eliminate leukemic blasts. That this may present an effective treatment option is supported by the apparent dependence of the efficacy of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation on the graft–versus–leukemia effect, mediated by T cell immunity against histocompatibility-mismatched leukemic blasts [
