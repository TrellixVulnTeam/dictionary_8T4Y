<p>We have shown that autologous bone marrow-derived lineage-negative early hematopoietic cells injected intrathecally are a safe and feasible source of material for transplantations to the CNS environment aimed at trophic support provision. Lin- cells intrathecal injection appeared to be a safe and well-tolerated procedure without transient or chronic adverse events. Therefore, with proper enrollment criteria and repeated cell applications, it may be possible to sustain their potentially beneficial effects, thus causing a gradual decrease or stop in ALS progression. Despite the variation in individual response arising, inter alia, due to different stages of the disease during enrollment, our preliminary results suggest that single intrathecal injection of bone marrow-derived early hematopoietic cells may cause some positive changes in various cytokines concentrations. Furthermore, our findings showed consistent miRNA expression profiles in the CSF and blood plasma, providing some presumable links between miRNA expression and the effects on the disease pathology; however, this needs further clarification. These data suggest that miR-206 or miR-133a in the CSF may also have a specific protective function at the synapse in ALS, where denervation occurs following motor neuron cell death. To our knowledge, this is the first study on miRNA-378 in ALS, which might potentially serve as a biomarker of disease progression. In our future studies, we aim to further investigate the role of miRNA-378 and its targets in the pathophysiology of ALS.</p>
