<p>BM from the patients was obtained after informed consent was given. BM samples (40–50 mL) were aspirated in local anesthesia, from the posterior iliac crest of recruited patients and subsequently resuspended in a collecting medium (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2) and heparin (20 U/mL; Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA). BM samples were lysed in BD PharmLyse Lysing Solution (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. The obtained suspension of BM nucleated cells (NCs) was subjected to immunomagnetic separation procedures (MiniMACS, Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, AL, USA). Lineage-negative SPCs (7.89 ± 5.77 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>) were isolated from non-separated NCs using immunomagnetic isolation and a lineage cell depletion kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, AL, USA), as described [
