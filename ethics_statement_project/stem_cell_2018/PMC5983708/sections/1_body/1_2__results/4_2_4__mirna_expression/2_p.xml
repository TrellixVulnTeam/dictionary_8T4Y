<p>Next, we became interested in systemic levels of selected miRNAs in the peripheral blood plasma. We found that in plasma, the expression levels of miRNA-155 were significantly higher (up to two times) in ALS patients from both groups after cell transplantation compared with the initial timepoint before Tx of Lin- cells. Furthermore, in group II of ALS patients, we detected a similar expression pattern in case of miRNA-206 before and after cell administration. In group I of ALS patients, miRNA-206 was also increased nearly 100% after Lin- cells Tx compared with the initial timepoint; however, in this case, the difference did not reach statistical significance. In contrast, we found that levels of miRNA-378 were significantly lower (maximally up to three times) one month after Lin- cells therapy in both groups of ALS patients. Likewise, Lin- cells administration induced a significant decrease of miRNA-1 expression in group II of ALS patients one month post-injection. We did not detect any difference between experimental timepoints when analyzing the expression pattern of miRNA-133a in plasma.</p>
