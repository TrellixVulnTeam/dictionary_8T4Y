<p>Our results of miRNA expression analysis in the CSF and plasma are depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01312-f003">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01312-f004">Figure 4</xref> respectively. We found that in the CSF, the expression levels of miRNA-206 were significantly higher (up to two times) in ALS patients from both groups after cell transplantation compared to the initial timepoint before Lin- cells administration. Interestingly, relatively similar significant results were observed in case of miRNA-133a in both groups of ALS patients before and after cell Tx. In contrast, we found that levels of miRNA-378 were significantly lower one month after Lin- cells therapy in both groups of ALS patients. We did not detect any difference between experimental timepoints when analyzing the expression pattern of miRNA-1 and miRNA-155 in the CSF.
