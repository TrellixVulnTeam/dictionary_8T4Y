<p>Using multiplex immunoassay, we have also assessed the levels of NGF and BDNF in plasma samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01312-f002">Figure 2</xref>). We have observed that in group I, NGF levels considerably increased in the first days after cells injection; however, they began to gradually decrease after a week, presenting with the lowest concentration in six months post-transplantation at the end of the investigation. Interestingly, in group II of ALS patients, the levels of NGF were considerably decreased in all study time-points compared with the corresponding time-points in group I before and after cell therapy. General tendency in the changes of concentration of BDNF in plasma were similar in both groups; although, in group I, we have noted an increase in BDNF level in the third day post-transplantation (from 1382.6 pg/mL to 2588.4 pg/mL). In group II, the upswing was much lower indeed (from 915.6 pg/mL to 1172.0 pg/mL). However, the only statistically significant difference was observed for NGF in group I (three days vs. six months), but the interpretation must be cautious due to the large variation in the levels of NGF, the small number of patients investigated, and the lack of a control group.
