<p>We found that levels of C3 were significantly lower (up to two times) after Lin- cells transplantation in ALS patients from group I than before transplantation (Tx). In contrast, C3 concentration after Lin- cells transplantation in ALS patients from group II was significantly higher than before cell administration (

Interestingly, when we compared the levels of C3 before cell therapy in patients diagnosed with ALS from both groups included in the study, we observed significantly higher (up to two times) C3 concentration in patients from group I. In addition, the analysis of the initial concentration of C4 before Lin- cells transplantation revealed a 50% increase in the individuals from group II. We observed no significant differences in the levels of neurotrophic (NGF and BDNF) and angiopoietic (ANGP2 and VEGF) growth factors between the individuals from both groups of patients diagnosed with ALS neither before nor after Lin- cells transplantation (
