<p>In the group of myo-miRs, the key regulator of the signaling between the motor neurons and skeletal muscle fibers at the neuromuscular synapses is miR-206—a skeletal muscle-specific microRNA affected in course of ALS. It has been found that deficiency of miR-206 in the ALS mouse model (SOD1G93A mice) accelerates disease progression, as miR-206 is required for efficient regeneration of neuromuscular synapses after nerve injury, which process probably accounts for the salutary effects in ALS. Of note, miR-206 mediates these effects through histone deacetylase 4 and fibroblast growth factor signaling pathways in ALS-affected muscle cells [

In our study, the expression levels of this molecule were altered in all ALS patients recruited to this study, and we observed a significant increase in miR-206 levels one month after Lin- cells transplantation among both groups of ALS patients (groups I and II). Importantly, a similar pattern of expression changes in both study groups was observed after Lin- cells transplantation and also in case of another myo-miR—miR133a. Increased expression levels of both analyzed myo-miRs post-transplantation could have positive regulatory effects by promoting the formation of new synapses that may delay the progression of ALS in our patient cohort after Lin- cells transplantation. This observation is in concordance with the findings of previous studies that muscles upregulate these miRs in a futile attempt to promote reinnervation after their damage and thus resist disease progression [
