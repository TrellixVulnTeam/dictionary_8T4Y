<p>It was reported from the analysis of postmortem ALS spinal cord tissue that a robust complement activation has been detected at RNA and protein levels in ALS patients, leading to increased amounts of different activated complement components in the CSF and plasma, as well as directly in the spinal cord [

 <xref rid="B44-ijms-19-01312" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In a model of immune activation in ALS proposed by this group, the stressed neurons and the surrounding glial cells produced complement C1q and C4. C4 has been also shown to play a role in the attraction and activation of macrophages in SOD1 mutant mice [
 <xref rid="B45-ijms-19-01312" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. C1q represents the initiating component of the classic complement pathway (C1→C4/C2/C3→C5) [
 <xref rid="B46-ijms-19-01312" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], whereas C3 is central to the classic and the alternative complement pathway (C3→C3/B→C5) [
 <xref rid="B47-ijms-19-01312" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Although most complement components are produced by the liver, many different cell types, including CNS microglia, specific neuronal populations, and astrocytes, can produce C3 and C4 [
 <xref rid="B48-ijms-19-01312" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Activation of the complement system and pro-inflammatory microglia may result in the impairment of the BBB; therefore, the increased levels of C3 and C4 in the CSF in ALS might result from both the increased intrathecal synthesis and the influx from the systemic circulation.
