<p>Although our study groups were too small to validate the specificity and sensitivity of the selected miRNAs as biomarkers, on the basis of our results one can conclude that one of the miRNA profiling assets in ALS is consistency of expression tendencies in the CSF and plasma. However, we cannot compare the obtained data with control group values due to the lack of a control group for the procedure in this preliminary study, which is explained below. We propose, that miRNA-155, -206, and -378 could serve as useful biomarkers of ALS response to bone marrow-derived cell therapeutic administration, but this needs further elucidation. However, for each of the analyzed miRNAs, whether the change contributes directly to disease progression or represents a compensatory/beneficial response to cell therapy remains unclear. In particular, this is a first study of miR-378 in ALS, and a vast spectrum of miR-378 targets could provide a link between various processes underlying ALS pathophysiology. In our future studies, we will aim to further investigate the emerging role of miR-378 in ALS and its potential in diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.</p>
