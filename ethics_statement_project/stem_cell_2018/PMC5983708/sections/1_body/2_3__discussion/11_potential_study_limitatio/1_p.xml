<p>Overall, our study gave some interesting results, but it did not lack some drawbacks. The first is the diversity of the investigated group—patients enrolled in the study differed considerably in terms of the disease onset (17–62 years), ALS disease duration (8–108 months), and the number of available Lin- cells transplanted into each particular patient. Also, due to the characteristics of our study based on Lin- cells injection, the experiment was conducted only in ALS patients, lacking a control group. Overall, this study was not designed, nor was large enough, to determine the efficacy of slowing or stopping the progression of ALS. In addition, the clinical progression in ALS is highly variable, and the biological factors accounting for this variability are still unknown. Therefore, for proper reasoning, we divided the study cohort arbitrary into two separated groups, which included only six participants, related to their clinical outcomes, further limiting our ability to make any conclusive statements about the therapeutic efficacy of the Lin- cells transplantation. We could only observe in these small groups the changes in molecular expression of selected proteins and miRNAs. Nevertheless, we must be cautious about ascribing the cause and effect of the performed intervention to the ALS patients recruited to the study. In the absence of a control group, it remains unclear whether changes in these parameters were due to the injected cells themselves or a response of the host tissue. Additional studies are warranted to address this study limitation.</p>
