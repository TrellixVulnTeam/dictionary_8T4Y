<p>The important role of neuroinflammation mediated by glial and immune cells that are active players in the pathogenesis of ALS is emerging [

 <xref rid="B41-ijms-19-01312" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In our study, there were significant differences in C3 and C4 concentration between study groups. Importantly, before cell transplantation, group I presented higher C3 and lower C4 levels than group II. After Lin- cells transplantation, C3 levels decreased in group I, but increased in patients from group II, whose neurological condition deteriorated in course of ALS.
