<p>The currently available treatment option for ALS in Poland is riluzole, which prolongs life by 2â€“3 months with debatable functional improvement [

Recently, increased emphasis has arisen on novel treatment options for neurodegenerative disorders using stem cell-based therapies, which have been widely investigated in two major directions: cell replacement and trophic support. The first approach aims at replacing the degenerated neurons, while the latter claims that stem/progenitor cells (SCs/SPCs, respectively) might provide a neuroprotective microenvironment for damaged tissue and save the remaining neurons [
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-19-01312" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In recent years, numerous studies have shown that stem cell transplantation elicits neurogenesis and angiogenesis as stem cells release numerous growth factors, which regulate the growth, differentiation and migration of neural SPCs [

 <xref rid="B14-ijms-19-01312" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It seems that in ALS, in the absence of one specific causative mechanism identified, the protection of the motoneurons with multipotent growth factors remains the most rational approach available. So far, the majority of studies and clinical trials in ALS have been focused on neurotrophic factors, but also other growth factors have been investigated for their not-so-obvious neurotrophic properties (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)).
