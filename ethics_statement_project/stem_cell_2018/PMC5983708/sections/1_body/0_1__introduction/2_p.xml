<p>During the neurodegeneration of ALS, dysfunction occurs at both the motor neuron cell body and peripheral motor axon. The postulated pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for motor neurons degeneration involve oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and protein aggregates abnormally activating major histocompatibility complex class I [

Recently, it was shown that neuroinflammation mediated by glial cells and systemic immune activation may play a key role in the progression of the disease, through mechanisms that can be either neuroprotective or neurodetrimental, depending on the type of cells and the motor neuron compartment involved [

Several studies have indicated that the immune system is actively involved in the progression of ALS—CNS, microglia and astrocytes are activated during disease progression, whereas peripheral T lymphocytes and natural killer cells infiltrate the spinal cord. Previous studies have shown that many proteins contributing to inflammation and/or the innate immune system may exhibit high levels in the CSF, plasma, or tissues of ALS patients (e.g., tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), circulating chemokines, and cytokines). Among them, toll-like receptors (TLRs) have an important part in the formation of chronic inflammation in neurodegenerative illnesses such as ALS [
