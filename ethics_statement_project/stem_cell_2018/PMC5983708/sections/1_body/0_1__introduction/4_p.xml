<p>Three distinct families of neurotrophic factors (NTFs) have been characterized in recent years: classical neurotrophins (e.g., nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin 4 (NT-4)); the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family of ligands (GDNF), neurturin (NRTN), artemin (ARTN), and persephin (PSPN)); and neuropoietic cytokines [

The accessibility of neurotrophic factors in optimal levels is critical during development, but they also regulate motor neuron maintenance and survival even long after neurons have become fully differentiated. NTs might be an interesting treatment tool for various neurodegenerative disorders; however, their poor pharmacokinetic profiles (primarily their inability to cross the bloodâ€“brain barrier (BBB) and short half-life) make their application in a protein form largely ineffective [
