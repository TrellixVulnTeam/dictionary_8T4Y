<p>We have previously shown that umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived SPCs, especially Lin- cells, strongly and specifically express classical NTs and the novel neurotrophic cytokines: cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF), mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF), pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), and the aforementioned VEGF. We have also shown that these secreted factors support neuronal proliferation and in vitro survival in a conditioned medium from Lin-SPCs [

Because miRNAs and growth factors have a strong role in ALS pathology, we hypothesized that this adjuvant cell therapy could also bring specific changes in the expression profiles in both the CSF and blood plasma of ALS patients.
