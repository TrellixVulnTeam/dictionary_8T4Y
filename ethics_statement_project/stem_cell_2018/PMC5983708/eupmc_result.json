"Therapeutic options for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are still limited. Great hopes, however, are placed in growth factors that show neuroprotective abilities (e.g., nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) and in the immune modulating features, in particular, the anti-inflammatory effects. In our study we aimed to investigate whether a bone marrow-derived lineage-negative (Lin-) cells population, after autologous application into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), is able to produce noticeable concentrations of trophic factors and inflammatory-related proteins and thus influence the clinical course of ALS. To our knowledge, the evaluation of Lin- cells transplantation for ALS treatment has not been previously reported. Early hematopoietic Lin- cells were isolated from twelve ALS patients&rsquo; bone marrow, and later, the suspension of cells was administered into the subarachnoid space by lumbar puncture. Concentrations of selected proteins in the CSF and plasma were quantified by multiplex fluorescent bead-based immunoassays at different timepoints post-transplantation. We also chose microRNAs (miRNAs) related to muscle biology (miRNA-1, miRNA-133a, and miRNA-206) and angiogenesis and inflammation (miRNA-155 and miRNA-378) and tested, for the first time, their expression profiles in the CSF and plasma of ALS patients after Lin- cells transplantation. The injection of bone marrow cells resulted in decreased concentration of selected inflammatory proteins (C3) after Lin- cells injection, particularly in patients who had a better clinical outcome. Moreover, several analyzed miRNAs have changed expression levels in the CSF and plasma of ALS patients subsequent to Lin- cells administration. Interestingly, the expression of miR-206 increased in ALS patients, while miR-378 decreased both in the CSF and plasma one month after the cells&rsquo; injection. We propose that autologous lineage-negative early hematopoietic cells injected intrathecally may be a safe and feasible source of material for transplantations to the central nervous system (CNS) environment aimed at anti-inflammatory support provision for ALS adjuvant treatment strategies. Further research is needed to evaluate whether the observed effects could significantly influence the ALS progression.", "affiliation": "Department of General Pathology, Pomeranian Medical University, 70-111 Szczecin, Poland. ania.sobus@gmail.com.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Clinical Trial", "research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Subarachnoid Space"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Hematopoietic Stem Cells", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "IM", "qualifierName": "immunology", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "CH", "qualifierName": "chemistry", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Cerebrospinal Fluid", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "CH", "qualifierName": "chemistry", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "IM", "qualifierName": "immunology", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}, {"abbreviation": "TH", "qualifierName": "therapy", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "MicroRNAs", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "BL", "qualifierName": "blood", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "CF", "qualifierName": "cerebrospinal fluid", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "GE", "qualifierName": "genetics", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Spinal Puncture"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Transplantation, Autologous"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Adult"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Female"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Male"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Immunity, Humoral", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "IM", "qualifierName": "immunology", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Transcriptome", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "GE", "qualifierName": "genetics", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}}}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Complement", "Neurotrophins", "MicroRNA", "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Als)", "Lin- Cells", "Trophic Effects Of Stem Cell-based Therapy"]}, "chemicalList": {"chemical": {"name": "MicroRNAs", "registryNumber": "0"}}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms19051312"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5983708"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5983708?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "12", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "Y", "tmAccessionTypeList": {"accessionType": "nct"}, "dateOfCompletion": "2018-10-01", "dateOfCreation": "2018-04-28", "firstIndexDate": "2018-04-28", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-11", "dateOfRevision": "2019-01-24", "electronicPublicationDate": "2018-04-27", "firstPublicationDate": "2018-04-27"}, "htmllinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5983708", "abstract": "Therapeutic options for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are still limited.
