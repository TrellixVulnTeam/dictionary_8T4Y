<p id="Par20">Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that IMGN529 exposure did not increase proportionally with dose over the entire dose range during cycle 1. Lower doses (&lt;0.8 mg/kg) showed increased clearance and decreased terminal half-life relative to doses above 1.0 mg/kg, consistent with TMDD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. IMGN529 exhibited a dose-proportional increase in AUC
 <sub>∞</sub> at doses ≥1.0 mg/kg. Maximal IMGN529 concentrations increased proportionally over the entire dose range, and the volume of distribution was consistent with plasma volume at all doses.
