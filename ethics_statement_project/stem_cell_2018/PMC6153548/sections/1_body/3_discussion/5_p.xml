<p id="Par22">Preliminary biomarker analyses were additionally performed using a subset of 33 patient samples that were available for CD37 expression staining, two-thirds of which were found to express the antigen at high levels. Based on the small sample size, however, no statistically relevant relationships between CD37 expression and likelihood of response were detected. Further efforts are therefore needed to identify any predictive or prognostic biomarkers associated with IMGN529 treatment.</p>
