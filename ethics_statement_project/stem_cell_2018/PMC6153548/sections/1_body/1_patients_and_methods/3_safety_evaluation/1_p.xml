<p id="Par8">Safety assessments performed at screening included medical history and physical examination, ECOG performance status, electrocardiogram, blood chemistry and hematology, and serum pregnancy test. Adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 and monitored from the time of the first study dose until 28 days after treatment cessation. A DLT was defined as any of the following treatment-related adverse events that occurred during cycle 1: grade 4 neutropenia lasting &gt;5 days despite growth factor support; grade 4 febrile neutropenia or febrile neutropenia as defined by an ANC &lt;500/mm
 <sup>3</sup> with a sustained temperature above 38.5 °C (101.3 °F); grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding requiring transfusion; grade 4 thrombocytopenia lasting &gt;5 days or with bleeding and/or requiring platelet transfusion; ≥ grade 2 peripheral neuropathy; ≥ 3 vomiting, nausea, or diarrhea despite optimum supportive care; serum creatine or bilirubin levels ≥3 x ULN; or any grade ≥ 3 non-hematologic toxicity (other than alopecia or grade 3 occurrences of fatigue, allergic hypersensitivity reaction, tumor lysis syndrome, or asymptomatic elevations in biochemistry laboratory values lasting ≤7 days). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined at as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of six patients experienced a DLT.
