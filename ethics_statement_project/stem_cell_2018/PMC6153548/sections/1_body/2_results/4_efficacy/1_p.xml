<p id="Par17">The maximum post-baseline tumor size changes in target lesions for 39 patients who were evaluable for disease response are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a. A total of five objective responses were observed, resulting in an overall response rate (ORR) of 13% (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Four of these (1 complete response [CR] and 3 partial responses [PRs]) occurred in patients with DLBCL, for an ORR of 22% in this lymphoma subset. Notably, the CR occurred in a patient with DLBCL of non-germinal center B-cell (non-GCB) origin treated at 1.0 mg/kg and lasted 4.2 months (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Pre- and post-treatment scans from this 67-year-old woman, who had previously progressed following two earlier lines of chemoimmunotherapy (R-CHOP and R-ICE) and a subsequent autologous stem cell transplant, are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b. Two of the PRs occurred in patients with GCB-DLBCL treated at 0.4 mg/kg and the third in an individual with unclassified DLBCL administered IMGN529 at 1.0 mg/kg, with a duration of response of 8.4 months (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Another patient with FL accounted for the remaining PR seen on-study. Stable disease was noted in an additional 8 patients (21%) across histological subtypes.
