<p id="Par16">The mean plasma PK parameters for IMGN529, determined for each dose level on the basis of samples obtained during cycle 1, are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. Clearance (CL) was substantially higher at the lowest doses relative to that observed at the upper end of the dose range and the mean t½ values ranged from 4.9 h at 0.1 mg/kg to greater than 24 h at doses ≥0.8 mg/kg. These changes are consistent with target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) at low doses, with saturation of this mechanism occurring at higher doses. When the upper dose range (1.0–1.8 mg/kg) was tested, both AUC
 <sub>∞</sub> and C
 <sub>max</sub> showed dose-proportionality. In each dose cohort, Vz values were consistent with plasma volume, suggesting that IMGN529 is largely confined to the central compartment. In addition, overall PK parameters were generally consistent between cycles 1 and 3 (data not shown), suggesting that PK did not change upon repeat dosing.
