<p id="Par15">Adverse events were reported in all 49 patients; with events of grade 3 or higher seen in 32 individuals (65%). Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> lists adverse events of all grades reported in more than 10% of the population and any ≥ grade 3 events occurring in 2 or more subjects. Apart from neutropenia, the most frequent events were primarily ≤ grade 2 and included fatigue, pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, and diarrhea. Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 10 patients (20%): one 0.2 mg/kg patient (grade 2 asthenia), one 0·4 mg/kg patient (grade 3 febrile neutropenia), two 0.8 mg/kg patients (the DLTs of grade 2 peripheral sensory neuropathy and grade 4 neutropenia listed above), one 0.7 mg/kg patient (unrelated cardiac arrest which resulted in a fatal outcome), one 1.0 mg/kg patient (grade 3 tumor lysis syndrome), one 1.4 mg/kg patient (invasive ductal breast carcinoma), one 1.8 mg/kg patient (grade 3 pneumonia 
 <italic>Legionella</italic>), plus two additional cases of grade 2 infusion related reactions (one each in the 0.4 with steroid prophylaxis and 1.8 mg/kg cohorts). Twelve patients experienced a serious adverse event; in 8 individuals (16%) these were considered related to study drug, with grade 3 febrile neutropenia the most frequently observed (5 patients; 10%). No treatment-related deaths occurred during the study.
