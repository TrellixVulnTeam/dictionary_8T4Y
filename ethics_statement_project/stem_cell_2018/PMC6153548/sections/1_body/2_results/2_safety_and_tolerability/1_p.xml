<p id="Par14">As part of escalation, doses of IMGN529 were doubled from 0.1 mg/kg to 0.8 mg/kg before DLTs were observed (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). At 0.8 mg/kg, the first two patients experienced DLTs of grade 4 neutropenia and grade 2 peripheral sensory neuropathy, respectively, prompting dose reduction back to 0.4 mg/kg. Two patients subsequently experienced transient grade 3 febrile neutropenia (in the absence of infection) as a DLT in their first cycle of treatment which resulted in a protocol amendment to include peri-infusional prophylactic steroid administration on days 1–3. This modification reduced the incidence of these early-onset (within 4 days of infusion) myelosuppressive events seen in the initial dosing cohorts. Three patients each were then treated at 0.4 mg/kg and 0.7 mg/kg doses on this corticosteroid regimen with no reported DLTs. Among the first three patients in the 1.0 mg/kg dose group, one DLT of grade 3 febrile neutropenia, and two events of grade 4 neutropenia were observed; these were delayed-onset, beginning 12–15 days post-dosing. Granulocyte growth factor support as primary prophylaxis was then implemented for all patients in all cycles. Three subsequent patients were treated at 1.0 mg/kg and no further reports of neutropenia as DLTs were seen. One of six patients in the 1.4 mg/kg cohort with growth factor support experienced a DLT of grade 4 thrombocytopenia. The 1.8 mg/kg dose was poorly tolerated due to the occurrence of multiple DLTs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Based on these findings, the MTD of IMGN529 with growth factor support was determined to be 1.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The 0.7 mg/kg dose is currently being investigated in combination with rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL and other forms of B-cell NHLs (NCT02564744).
