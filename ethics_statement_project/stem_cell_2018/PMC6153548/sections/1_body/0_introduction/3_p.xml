<p id="Par4">Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) technology provides targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents via linkage to monoclonal antibodies directed against tumor-associated antigens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Importantly, this approach has been clinically validated with four ADCs currently approved for use in human cancer: brentuximab vedotin, a conjugate of an anti-CD30 antibody with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] that is approved for relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma, systemic anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, and most recently for subtypes of cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma; ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), a conjugate of trastuzumab with the maytansinoid DM1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], used to treat HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer; and two calicheamicin-bearing conjugates, inotuzumab ozogamicin and gemtuzumab ozogamicin, CD22- and CD33-targeting ADCs approved to treat B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia, respectively. IMGN529 is an ADC comprised of a humanized anti-CD37 monoclonal antibody linked to DM1, which combines the intrinsic proapototic and effector activities of its antibody component with the potent cytotoxic activity of its payload [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. High affinity binding of IMGN529 to CD37 followed by its internalization results in the intracellular release and accumulation of DM1, which in turn promotes disruption of microtubule assembly, G2/metaphase arrest, and ultimately apoptosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In preclinical studies, IMGN529 has shown robust antitumor activity in CD37-positive NHL models [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], thus providing a rationale for its clinical evaluation as targeted therapy for the treatment of B-cell malignancies.
