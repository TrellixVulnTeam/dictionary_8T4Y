<p id="Par2">Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) represents a heterogeneous collection of distinct malignancies of the lymphatic system, each associated with their own pathological features and clinical outcomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Approximately 85% of NHL diagnoses are of B-cell origin; the most frequent histological subtypes include diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Since its introduction into B-cell lymphoma management two decades ago, the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab has improved survival outcomes for patients with DLBCL, FL, and MCL, as well as in other subsets [
