<p id="Par3">One promising target is the tetraspanin CD37, a transmembrane protein whose exact physiological function(s) are yet to be defined, although there is evidence to suggest it is involved in immune cell proliferation and survival [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In normal tissues, CD37 shows a restricted distribution pattern with expression limited to lymphoid tissues - most frequently on the surface of B-cells from the pre-B through the peripheral mature stages of differentiation but absent on early progenitor and terminally differentiated plasma cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Importantly, CD37 is highly expressed on malignant B-cells, including most subtypes of NHL [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This differential expression profile identified CD37 as a candidate for the development of novel therapeutics. A limited number of CD37-targeting approaches have been explored to date, including radioimmunotherapy with a radiolabeled anti-CD37 antibody (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], a CD37-binding small immunopharmaceutical protein (TRU-016) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and a Fc-engineered antibody (BI836826) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], with the latter two agents both exhibiting antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and apoptosis-inducing abilities.
