  <p>Antitumor responses to IMGN529 monotherapy in patients with B-cell NHL. 
   <bold>a</bold> Maximum changes in target lesions from baseline at best response are shown, measured by CT or PET, according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma. Data are for the 39 NHL patients in the response-evaluable dose-escalation population. Each bar represents an individual patient; histological subtypes are grouped as indicated. *Patients had a reduction/disappearance of target lesions, however developed a concurrent new lesion and therefore classified as having progressive disease. 
   <bold>b</bold> Activity of IMGN529 in a relapsed DLBCL patient (non-GCB subtype) who achieved a complete response. The 67-year-old woman had progressed following two earlier lines of chemoimmunotherapy (R-CHOP and R-ICE) and a subsequent autologous stem cell transplant prior to being treated with IMGN529 at 1.0Â mg/kg. The red circles show complete regression of the target lesion during the third cycle of treatment
