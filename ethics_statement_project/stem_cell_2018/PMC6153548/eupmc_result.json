IMGN529 is an antibody-drug conjugate comprising a CD37-binding antibody linked to the maytansinoid DM1, a potent anti-mitotic agent. Methods This first-in-human, phase 1 trial recruited adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL. The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose. Secondary objectives were to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary clinical activity. IMGN529 was administered intravenously once every 3\u00a0weeks, and dosed using a conventional 3\u2009+\u20093 dose-escalation design. Results Forty-nine patients were treated at doses escalating from 0.1 to 1.8\u00a0mg/kg. Dose limiting toxicities occurred in eight patients and included peripheral neuropathy, febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events were fatigue (39%), neutropenia, pyrexia, and thrombocytopenia (each 37%). Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 10 patients (20%). Eight patients (16%) had treatment-related serious adverse events, the most common being grade 3 febrile neutropenia. The MTD (with growth factor support) was 1.4\u00a0mg/kg every 3\u00a0weeks. IMGN529 plasma exposure increased monotonically with dose and was consistent with target-mediated drug disposition. Five (13%) of 39 response-evaluable patients achieved an objective response (one complete response and four partial responses), four of which occurred in the subgroup of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
