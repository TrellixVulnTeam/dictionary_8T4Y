<p id="Par52">Continual technical improvements in mechanical coronary revascularization have produced as a paradoxical effect a growing number of patients with severe coronary disease, which are no more suitable for further revascularizations and experience refractory angina (RA) despite best medical management. It has been estimated that RA approximates an incidence as high as 50,000 and 30,000–50,000 new cases per year in the USA and continental Europe, respectively [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although the mortality prognosis has improved over time, with current rates approaching 3–5% per year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], the morbidity counterpart of such a challenging condition still remains a relevant burden for patients as well as health care systems. In particular, RA patients complain of inadequate pain relief leading to revisits to local hospital emergency departments, and undergo repeated coronary investigations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The presence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction worsens this scenario, contributing to reduce long-term survival and to increase hospitalization rates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In this context, it has been unambiguously shown that ischemia reduction has a pivotal importance for patient survival [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Available treatment options on top of best interventional and medical therapy are still limited. Enhanced external counterpulsation, shock waves and coronary sinus reduction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] have shown therapeutic potential, although none of them has so far gained enough acceptance to enter the routine therapeutic armamentarium.
