<p id="Par110">The RECARDIO trial was the first designed to address safety and preliminary efficacy of intramyocardial injection of ATMP-CD133 in the RA patient subset with LV dysfunction, and to correlate perfusion changes with CD133
 <sup>+</sup> cell function. The satisfactory safety profile along with perfusion amelioration at SPECT may open larger controlled investigations in this context. Moreover, the observed link between cell function and SPECT changes hints for the first time in patients at mechanistic insights for a vasculogenic CD133
 <sup>+</sup> cell MoA.
