<p id="Par87">Fluoroscopy-guided endocavitary intramyocardial cell injections were successfully accomplished in all 10 patients. Patients received a mean total volume of 7.76 ± 0.8 ml, delivered in a median of 12 independent injections of 0.5–0.7 ml each. All injections were double-checked with ICE to confirm engagement of the needle into the LV wall. Mean total procedural duration was 252 ± 91 min, while the mapping and injection time averaged 105 ± 29 min (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In four cases, the injection procedure was preceded by CARTO-guided electroanatomical mapping. An ILR was implanted in eight patients, with the exception of two cases who were already recipients of an ICD.
