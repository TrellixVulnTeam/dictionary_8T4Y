<p id="Par98">To evaluate whether the ATMP-CD133 functional profile correlates with the observed improvements in myocardial perfusion at SPECT, linear regression analyses were performed. Notably, SSS changes were found to be significantly correlated with the secreted proangiogenic growth factors HGF (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.80, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.009) and PDGF-bb (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.77, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a, b</xref>). On the contrary, a negative significant correlation with SSS improvements was found for the proinflammatory cytokines RANTES (
 <italic>r</italic> = − 0.79, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) and IL-6 (
 <italic>r</italic> = − 0.76, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02), as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c, d</xref>. No other correlations have been detected between myocardial perfusion changes and ATMP-CD133 functional profile.
