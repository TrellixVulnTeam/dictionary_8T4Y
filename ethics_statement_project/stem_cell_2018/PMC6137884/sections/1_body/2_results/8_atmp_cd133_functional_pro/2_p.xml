<p id="Par96">Flow cytometry analysis at 7 days showed the expression at high levels of early endothelial markers such as CD31 (35.95 ± 16.55%) and, to a lesser extent, KDR (26.42 ± 28.13%). The expression of CD144, recognized as a terminally differentiated endothelial marker, was detectable in a minority of cells (15.58 ± 18.01%). After 14 days, CD31 and KDR expression levels decreased to 17.95 ± 18.96% and 19.71 ± 18.32%, respectively, while CD144 expression was maintained (14.04 ± 15.99%).</p>
