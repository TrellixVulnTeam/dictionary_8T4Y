<p id="Par95">ATMP-CD133 samples were obtained in all patients. ATMP-CD133 CPDL derived after three expansion passages varied highly among samples, ranging from 1.45 to 5.59 with a mean value of 3.32 ± 1.33. After a conditioned period of 48 h, ATMP-CD133 supernatants showed the modulation of the expression levels of several proangiogenic, proinflammatory and anti-angiogenic factors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Among those tested, a large amount of proangiogenic cytokines and growth factors such as IL-8 and VEGF (1722 ± 1218 and 1293 ± 1153 pg/ml/10
 <sup>5</sup> cells, respectively) and, in less proportion, proinflammatory cytokines such as MCP-1 (768 ± 619 pg/ml/10
 <sup>5</sup> cells) were secreted. Consistently, low levels of anti-angiogenic cytokines, like LIF and IL-10, were found (13.61 ± 37.42 and 6.61 ± 10.42 pg/ml/10
 <sup>5</sup> cells, respectively).
