<p id="Par97">After 14 days under differentiation conditions, it was found that ATMP-CD133 form a number of CFU-EC which was strongly different among samples, ranging from 47 to 700 colonies/10
 <sup>5</sup> cells with a median of 150 (85–415). At immunofluorescence, both clustered and nonclustered cells derived from ATMP-CD133 were double-positive for Ac-LDL-Dil and UEA-1 lectin staining, confirming their endothelial commitment (Fig.
