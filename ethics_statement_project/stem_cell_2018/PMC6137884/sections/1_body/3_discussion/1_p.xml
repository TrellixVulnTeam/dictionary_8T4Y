<p id="Par99">The RECARDIO phase I trial was designed to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of transcatheter intramyocardial injections of ATMP-CD133 in patients with RA and LV dysfunction (EF ≤ 45%). The major finding of this pilot study was that LV dysfunction in highly symptomatic RA patients does not alter the positive safety profile of catheter-based intramyocardial cell delivery. Further, a favorable preliminary efficacy signal in terms of SSS and SDS improvements at SPECT between baseline and 6-month follow-up was observed. Finally, a correlation was found for the first time in the RA context between myocardial perfusion changes and the ATMP-CD133 secretome profile.</p>
