<p id="Par106">As for the cell number, even if no dose-finding studies are available for CD133
 <sup>+</sup> cells in RA, we have delivered into the myocardium a mean of 6.5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CD133
 <sup>+</sup> cells, a cell dosage 2-fold higher than the REGENT-VSEL study, which is the only one of the RCT in RA delivering selected CD133
 <sup>+</sup> cells obtained from the BM.
