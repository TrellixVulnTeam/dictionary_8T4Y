<p id="Par105">Other factors, including guidance of cell delivery and the number of injected cells, may also be taken into account to explain variability among studies. Different from the REGENT-VSEL and PROGENITOR studies, in the RECARDIO trial intramyocardial injection was fluoroscopy based rather than NOGA based. Given the difficulty of anatomical matching between injections and SPECT target areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], the fluoroscopy-based approach may be postulated as less accurate in targeting injections in viable ischemic areas. This limitation was partially overcome by using electroanatomical mapping to reveal the electrical properties within the area of interest and exclude segments of scar. Besides, the routine use of ICE contributed to monitoring the needle engagement into the myocardial wall [
