<p id="Par103">In the PROGENITOR trial (Selected CD133
 <sup>+</sup> Progenitor Cells to Promote Angiogenesis in Patients With Refractory Angina) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], Jimenez-Quevedo et al. were the first to attempt NOGA-guided endocavitary intramyocardial injection of CD133
 <sup>+</sup> cells mobilized from PB in RA patients. Although differences between treated and control groups were not detectable, authors were able to show a significant improvement in CCS class and in the number of angina episodes per month in the treatment arm only. Besides, at 6 months, the summed score improved significantly at rest and stress in the cell arm. On the contrary, in the more recent placebo-controlled REGENT-VSEL study (Transendocardial Delivery of Bone Marrow–Derived CD133
 <sup>+</sup> Cells on Left Ventricle Perfusion and Function in Patients With Refractory Angina) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], Wojakowski et al. did not report any significant reduction of myocardial ischemia and angina vs placebo after NOGA-guided CD133
 <sup>+</sup> cell intramyocardial injection, although a mild but significant reduction of LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes was observed in the cell group only. Moreover, the odds ratio adjusted for confounding factors showed a 3.5-fold higher positive response at SPECT in patients allocated to the active arm vs placebo. In our RECARDIO pilot trial, the main efficacy signal was a significant intragroup improvement in perfusion at SPECT in terms of the SSS and SDS along with a reduction in the number of segments showing inducible myocardial ischemia after 6 months. Moreover, a consistent amelioration in the CCS and NYHA classes was also appreciated during the 12-month follow-up period.
