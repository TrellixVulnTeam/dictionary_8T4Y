<p id="Par107">The specificity of our study with respect to previous ones in RA was the inclusion of patients with moderate to severe LV dysfunction (baseline EF 38.3%), a scenario that may worsen the safety of CT. Nevertheless, we have confirmed the excellent safety profile of catheter-based intramyocardial cell injection, including the absence of any treatment-emergent SAE. Our results are in line with those reported in the FOCUS-CCTRN trial in which 92 patients with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy were randomized to transendocardial cell vs placebo injection, without safety issues in terms of mortality and SAE at early and mid-term [

Since one of the major safety concerns of transendocardial cell delivery is cardiac tamponade due to perforation, we have routinely utilized ICE to check the real-time status of the pericardium during injections. Such an adjuvant imaging technique was not previously reported in CT studies. Moreover, the long steerable shuttle sheet (Morph) of the Helix delivery technology (BioCardia Inc.) is helpful for safely handling the injection catheter both in the case of peripheral vessel tortuosity and for crossing the aortic valve in the case of calcified cusps.
