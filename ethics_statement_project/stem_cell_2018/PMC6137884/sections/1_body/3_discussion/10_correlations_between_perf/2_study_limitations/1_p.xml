<p id="Par109">The RECARDIO trial is a phase I uncontrolled study, so no efficacy claims can be extrapolated. Perfusion improvements detected at SPECT must be confirmed by larger RCT. Another possible study limitation is that the ATMP-CD133 cytokine profile has been gathered from in vitro experiments, which may not fully mimic the in vivo environment. Moreover, correlations observed between cell secretome and SSS improvement have to be only considered as a proof of concept of a possible ATMP-CD133 MoA that needs further mechanistic investigations.</p>
