<p id="Par68">The day following BM aspiration, patients were admitted to the catheterization laboratory to receive the fluoroscopy-based transendocardial cell injections. The injection technique was performed as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Briefly, selection of target injection sites was done by merging coronary angiography, SPECT and 2D echocardiogram imaging. Upon retrograde LV catheterization, two-view ventriculography was performed to trace LV chamber end-diastolic/end-systolic profiles and color-mark the target landing zone; the different sites for infusion were subsequently chosen within this area. To better guide the Helical Infusion Catheter (BioCardia Inc.), real-time intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) was used in all cases to monitor the appropriate intramyocardial location of the needle during cell delivery and to exclude the release of microbubbles into the cavity. Furthermore, ICE was able to directly visualize the cardiac structures (such as valves and ventricle papillary muscles) and promptly detect procedural complications (such as thrombus formation, valve damage, pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade). In selected cases, 3D electroanatomical mapping (CARTO; BiosenseWebster) was obtained in the area of interest to validate tissue viability by electrogram analysis at the site of injections [
