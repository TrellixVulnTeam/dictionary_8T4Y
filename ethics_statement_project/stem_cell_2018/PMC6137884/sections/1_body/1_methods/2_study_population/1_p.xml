<p id="Par60">The study population consisted of patients with severe CCS angina class III–IV and/or NYHA score II–IV under maximal tolerated medical therapy for at least 3 months not eligible for any type of conventional mechanical revascularization procedure based on the most recent coronary angiography (≤ 12 months). Additional inclusion criteria were: LV ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 45% as determined by 2D echocardiogram, CMR, or left ventriculogram; a reversible perfusion defect ≥ 10% of the LV surface by SPECT; and peak oxygen consumption (VO
 <sub>2</sub>) ≤ 21 ml/kg/min at CPET. Major exclusion criteria included: myocardial infarction (MI) within 3 months; presence of LV thrombus; LV wall thickness &lt; 8 mm at the target area of cell injections as assessed by 2D echocardiogram; mechanical aortic valve; severe renal failure (creatinine plasma level &gt; 2.5 mg/dl); positive infectious-disease test for HIV, hepatitis B or C,
