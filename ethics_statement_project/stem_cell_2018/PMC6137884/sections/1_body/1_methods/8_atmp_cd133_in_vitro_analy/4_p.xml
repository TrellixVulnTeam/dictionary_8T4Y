<p id="Par80">Immunophenotype analysis of endothelial markers (CD31, KDR, CD144) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] was performed by multicolor flow cytometry on cultured cells after 7 and 14 days of endothelial conditioning. After detachment, using a nonenzymatic method, cells were resuspended in washing buffer (WB) containing PBS, 0.1% BSA (Gibco) and 2 mM EDTA (Gibco), and incubated in the dark for 15 min with suitable combinations of the following monoclonal or isotype-matched control antibodies: CD31-FITC (clone WM59; BD), KDR-PE (clone 89,106; R&amp;D Systems) and CD144-APC (clone 16B1; R&amp;D Systems). Then, samples were washed with 1 ml of WB and centrifuged for 10 min at 400 × 
 <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C to remove unbound antibodies. Cells were then resuspended in 250 μl of WB and analyzed with a Gallios™ Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter).
