<p id="Par79">After three expansion passages, samples were seeded onto Fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich)-coated dishes in M199 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Microtech), 2 mM 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine (Euroclone) and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Seeded cells were cultured for 2, 7 or 14 days to carry out the secretome and the flow cytometry analyses, to measure the production of colony forming unit-endothelial cells (CFU-EC) and to assess the immunophenotype of cultured cells. In particular, after 2 days, ATMP-CD133 secretome (expressed as pg/ml/10
 <sup>5</sup> cells) was characterized using a customized Bio-Plex assay (BIO-RAD). The panel comprised six proangiogenic factors including SCF, growth-regulated oncogene alpha (GRO-α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor type bb (PDGF-bb), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and IL-8; four proinflammatory factors including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (MIP-1β), regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) and IL-6; and two anti-angiogenic factors including leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and IL-10. As a negative control, nonconditioned medium was tested.
