<p id="Par81">After 14 days in differentiation-promoting conditions, a CFU-EC assay was performed as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For immunofluorescence analysis, cells were incubated in the dark for 5 h at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml of acetylated low-density lipoprotein labeled with dioctadecyl-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (Ac-LDL-Dil; Biomedical Technologies). After washing with PBS, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min and then stained with 40 μg/ml of FITC-labeled Lectin from 
 <italic>Ulex europaeus</italic> agglutinin-1 (UEA-1 Lectin; Sigma-Aldrich) in the dark for 1 h. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 333,428 (Sigma-Aldrich) in the dark for 15 min. Cells were observed with a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope.
