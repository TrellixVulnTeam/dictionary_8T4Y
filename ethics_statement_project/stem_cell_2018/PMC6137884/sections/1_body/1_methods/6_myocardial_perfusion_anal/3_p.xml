<p id="Par74">The gated images were normalized to the region of highest activity on the end-systolic image set. Regional myocardial perfusion was assessed on the summed images. Perfusion imaging was scored semi-quantitatively using a 20-segment model scored on a 5-point scale (0 = normal, 4 = no uptake) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A perfusion defect with a score ≥ 3 was considered significant, and a segment score improved by at least one grade was considered reversible. The summed stress score (SSS) and summed rest score (SRS) were calculated in each patient by adding the 20 individual perfusion scores. The difference between the summed stress and rest scores is the summed difference score (SDS), which indicated the amount and the degree of reversible ischemia. The paired SPECT images were evaluated by two independent imaging readers blinded to the clinical data.
