<p id="Par72">SPECT perfusion studies were performed at baseline and 6 months after the procedure to evaluate the presence and the extent of reversible ischemia, expressed as a percentage of the LV. Stress and rest SPECT images were acquired 15–60 min after the injection of 555 MBq 
 <sup>99m</sup>Tc-Tetrofosmin. ECG-SPECT images were performed with patients in the supine position for a total of 64 projections, 3° interval, every 30 s, over a 180° elliptical orbit. Pharmacological stress with intravenous administration of dipyridamole (0.84 mg/kg over 6 min) or regadenoson (0.4 mg/5 ml) was used to obtain stress images.
