<p id="P14">The primary objectives were to determine a safe and effective CC-486 dosing regimen and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CC-486 in patients with MDS or AML in the post-alloSCT setting. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), cumulative 1-year relapse- and progression-free survival (RPFS), time to relapse, relapse rate, incidence of acute and chronic GVHD, time to treatment discontinuation, and pharmacokinetic parameters. The safety population included all patients who received ≥ 1 CC-486 dose. The efficacy population included all patients who received ≥ 1 CC-486 dose and had ≥ 1 post-baseline efficacy assessment. The pharmacokinetic population comprised a subset of study patients.</p>
