<p id="P21">Blood samples for CC-486 pharmacokinetic analyses were collected pre- and post-dose at .5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, and 6 hours on day 1 of cycles 1 and 2. Plasma samples were analyzed using a validated proprietary HPLC/tandem mass spectrometric method. Pharmacokinetic parameters included maximum observed plasma concentration, time of maximum observed plasma concentration, area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity, terminal elimination half-life, apparent total clearance, and apparent volume of distribution. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using noncompartmental methods with Phoenix WinNonlin software (Pharsight Corp, Mountain View, CA). To evaluate potential drugâ€“drug interactions, patients were alternately assigned to take their regular concomitant medications before the visit on day 1 of cycle 1 or 2 and to not to take their regular concomitant medications before the day 1 visit in the other cycle.</p>
