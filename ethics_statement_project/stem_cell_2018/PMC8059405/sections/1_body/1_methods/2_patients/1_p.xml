 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] who had undergone alloSCT with myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning regimens were eligible. Related and unrelated donors were permitted. Stem cells could be from peripheral blood or bone marrow. Donors could have a single mismatch at the HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, or -DQB1 loci. Patients must have had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score ≤2 and were to be in morphologic complete remission (CR; ie, ≤5% bone marrow blasts) with absolute neutrophil counts ≥1.0 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L and platelets ≥ 75 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L before CC-486 treatment initiation, which was to occur 42 to 84 days after alloSCT. This post-alloSCT interval was to allow for adequate marrow recovery before starting CC-486 treatment, based on our previous experience with parenteral azacitidine [
