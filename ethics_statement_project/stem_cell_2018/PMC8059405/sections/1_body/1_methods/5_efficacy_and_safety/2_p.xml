<p id="P19">OS was defined as the time from transplantation to death by any cause. RPFS was the time from transplantation to relapse, progressive disease, or death, whichever occurred first. Relapse and progressive disease were defined as the reappearance of &gt; 5% or &gt; 10% bone marrow blasts, respectively, lasting more than 4 weeks. Patients without a documented relapse were censored at the date of their last assessment or study completion. All patients were followed for survival until death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or study closure. Progression to AML was collected during follow-up for patients with MDS.</p>
