<p id="P15">A standard 3+3 dose-escalation design was followed to evaluate 4 CC-486 dosing schedules in repeated 28-day cycles: CC-486 200 mg (Cohort 1) or 300 mg (Cohort 2) once daily (QD) for 7 days per cycle or CC-486 150 mg (Cohort 3) or 200 mg (Cohort 4) QD for 14 days per cycle. Patients received enough CC-486 doses at a site visit on day 1 of each cycle to complete dosing for that cycle. The MTD was established if 2 dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred in a cohort during the first 2 treatment cycles. At the MTD, or if the MTD was not reached, a cohort could be expanded with an additional 10 to 12 patients to further evaluate that dosing regimen.</p>
