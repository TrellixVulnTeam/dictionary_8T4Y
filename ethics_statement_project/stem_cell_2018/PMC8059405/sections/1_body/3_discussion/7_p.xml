<p id="P39">Among limitations of these data are that this is a phase I dose-finding study, followed by a small phase II expansion, with no placebo-control group. It is unknown whether the benefit of CC-486 maintenance correlated with improvement in quality of life, because it was not evaluated. Additionally, no information regarding the presence of MRD before or after transplant was collected, and correlations between relapse status and changes in methylation levels during CC-486 study and extent of immune reconstitution were not assessed. Nonetheless, these data support the clinical benefits and acceptable safety profile of CC-486 as maintenance treatment after alloSCT in patients with MDS or AML. Based on these data, the recommended CC-486 post-transplant maintenance dosing regimen is 200-mg daily for 14 days per 28-day cycle. Our findings warrant further study in a larger patient population.</p>
