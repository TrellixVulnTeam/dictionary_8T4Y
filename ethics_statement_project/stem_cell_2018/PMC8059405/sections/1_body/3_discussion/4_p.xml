 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] The incidence of severe chronic GVHD in our study was low (10%), and only 2 patients discontinued the study due to a GVHD event. The generally mild presentation and low incidence of GVHD in this study support the hypothesis that CC-486 maintenance may permit epigenetic manipulation of the alloreactive response after transplantation. Two mechanisms have been proposed by which azacitidine is believed to induce tolerance and reduce the risk of GVHD: conversion of alloreactive donor T cells into suppressive regulatory T cells via hypomethylation of the
