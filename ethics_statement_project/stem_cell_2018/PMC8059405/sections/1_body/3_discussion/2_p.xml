<p id="P34">In the current study the RPFS rate was higher in the combined 14-day dosing cohort than in the 7-day dosing group, supporting the rationale for extended CC-486 dosing. The 1-year cumulative rate of relapse/disease progression with CC-486 maintenance administered for 14 days per cycle (13%) compares favorably with rates reported in studies of with 5-day dosing of low-dose s.c. azacitidine maintenance after alloSCT [

 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], although meaningful conclusions are elusive when comparing results of different studies with different patient populations and endpoints. For example, a phase I study evaluating low-dose s.c. azacitidine 8 to 40 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup>/day administered for 5 days per cycle after alloHSCT in patients with high-risk MDS or AML showed a 53% relapse rate at a median follow-up of 20.5 months. However, that study included a high proportion of patients with advanced disease characteristics, and most patients were not in CR at the time of transplant [

In any case, at-home administration of oral maintenance therapy may be more convenient for patients than making multiple daily clinic visits for parenteral drug administration. In the current study patients received enough CC-486 at the clinic on day 1 of each cycle to complete CC-486 dosing for that cycle at home.
