<p id="P33">Disease recurrence is a major therapeutic challenge in patients with MDS or AML undergoing alloSCT, and treatment options are limited [
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Risk of disease relapse after alloSCT is a composite of many factors, including age, cytogenetic and molecular status at diagnosis, and remission status at the time of transplantation [

 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Remission duration is one of the strongest predictors of post-transplant survival [
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This is the first prospective trial to evaluate post-transplant CC-486 therapy as a strategy to prevent or delay relapse in patients with AML or MDS. Therapy with CC-486 for 1 year was associated with a relatively low (21%) overall rate of disease relapse during treatment.
