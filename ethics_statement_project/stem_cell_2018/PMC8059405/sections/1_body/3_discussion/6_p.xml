<p id="P38">Use of maintenance therapy in hematologic disorders remains controversial [
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and whether and when to initiate maintenance treatment and how long to continue it are unresolved issues. The increasing use of next-generation sequencing may allow detection of measurable residual disease (MRD), which can be a harbinger of relapse [
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], to inform whether maintenance might benefit some patients, and sustained measurable residual disease negativity may suggest maintenance therapy is unnecessary or could be discontinued. The extent of donor chimerism may also suggest whether maintenance therapy might prolong remission post-transplant [
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Here, we somewhat arbitrarily planned for 12 CC-486 treatment cycles, with the goal of offering therapy during the period of time with higher risk of AML or MDS relapse, based on historic data [
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. One cannot underestimate the logistic challenges of prolonged maintenance therapy after allogeneic transplantation, which frequently include monitoring by different physicians and hospitals, patient and caregiver fatigue, and need for more intensive monitoring.
