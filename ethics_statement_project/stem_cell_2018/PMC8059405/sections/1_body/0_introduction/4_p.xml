<p id="P9">The DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, azacitidine, is a well-established treatment option for higher-risk MDS and AML [
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], shown to increase expression of epigenetically silenced leukemia antigens and to induce a CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell response to tumor antigens post-transplant, potentially augmenting a graft-versus-leukemia effect [
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Studies further suggest azacitidine may accelerate reconstitution of immunomodulatory regulatory T cells, which may reduce GVHD risk [

 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The dual activity of azacitidine as an antileukemic agent and inhibitor of GVHD makes it a promising agent for post-transplant therapy. Encouraging preliminary data have been reported for s.c. azacitidine maintenance therapy after alloSCT in patients with MDS and AML [

 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], although challenges with exposure and compliance are limitations of s.c. administration. AML and MDS are associated with hypermethylation and subsequent silencing of tumor suppressor genes [
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. With the recommended dosing schedule of s.c. azacitidine (75 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup>/day given on days 1 to 7 in 28-day treatment cycles), global DNA reduction is maximal at mid-cycle, whereupon remethylation begins and methylation returns to pre-treatment levels by cycle end [
