<p id="P7">Duration of remission is a key determinant of patient outcomes after alloSCT [
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A longer interval from transplant to relapse is associated with reduced risk of death [
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, maximizing the duration of remission is an important treatment goal [
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and novel therapeutic strategies are needed to provide long-term disease control and extend remission in the post-transplant setting.
