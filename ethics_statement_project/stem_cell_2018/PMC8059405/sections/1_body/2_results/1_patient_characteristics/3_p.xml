<p id="P25">The MTD of CC-486 was not reached at doses up to 200 mg/day for 14 days per cycle. No DLT was observed in Cohorts 1 to 3. In Cohort 4 (200 mg QD Ã— 14 days) 1 patient experienced a DLT during the first 2 treatment cycles (grade 4 neutropenia, grade 3 pneumonia), but no additional DLTs occurred and the criteria for MTD were not met. Based on observed efficacy and tolerability of the CC-486 200 mg 14-day dosing regimen, Cohort 4 was subsequently expanded to a total of 19 patients to further assess the clinical activity, safety, and tolerability of this regimen. Based on patient safety considerations with regenerating bone marrows and concern for the development of significant neutropenias or thrombocytopenia post-transplant, no higher dosing regimen was evaluated.</p>
