 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] higher-risk MDS. Patients were generally older (median age, 64.5 years [range, 28 to 80]). All patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status scores ≤ 1. At time of transplantation, 27 patients (90%) were in CR, 25 in first remission and 2 in second remission, and 3 patients (10%) had ≥ 5% bone marrow blasts. Eighteen patients had received a myeloablative conditioning regimen (busulfan and fludarabine, n = 14; busulfan and cyclophosphamide, n = 3; total body irradiation, cyclophosphamide, and thiotepa, n = 1) and 12 patients received a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen with fludarabine and melphalan. Twenty patients had unrelated donors, and 10 received stem cells from a sibling. Eight patients received stem cells from bone marrow and 22 patients from peripheral blood. Median time from alloSCT to start of CC-486 therapy was 81.5 days (range, 45 to 85). The median follow-up for patients in this study was 19.0 months (range, 1.0 to 41.3).
