 <sup>+</sup> cell dose threshold at transplant). The most common (â‰¥ 5% of patients) grades 3-to-4 TEAEs occurred at similar frequencies across all 4 dosing cohorts: diarrhea (20%), lymphopenia (20%), vomiting (17%), neutropenia (17%), nausea (13%), anemia (13%), thrombocytopenia (10%), and abdominal pain (7%). Treatment-related serious TEAEs were reported in 4 patients and included hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, asthenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, and intracranial hemorrhage. One TEAE-related death occurred on-study (intracranial hemorrhage) in the patient who experienced the DLT at cycle 2. This patient had raised lactate dehydrogenase at baseline and subsequently developed hemolysis, progressive thrombocytopenia, and a progressive rise in lactate dehydrogenase, and was considered to have had tacrolimus-associated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
