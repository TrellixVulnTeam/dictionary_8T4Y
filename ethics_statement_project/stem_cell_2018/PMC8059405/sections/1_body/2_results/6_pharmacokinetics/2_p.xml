<p id="P32">Azacitidine was rapidly absorbed, reaching mean maximum observed plasma concentration within approximately 1 hour post-dose and then decreasing in a multiphasic manner to a nonquantifiable level by the 6-hour time point (

 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) were not significantly different when taken with or without standard concomitant medications. Concomitant medications included (but were not limited to) prophylactic antibiotics, calcineurin inhibitors, antifungals, and antiviral agents; red blood cell and platelet transfusions; myeloid growth factors; antiemetics; and drugs to manage gastrointestinal complications. Moreover, pharmacokinetic parameters were within range of those reported for nontransplant patients treated with CC-486 in a different study [
