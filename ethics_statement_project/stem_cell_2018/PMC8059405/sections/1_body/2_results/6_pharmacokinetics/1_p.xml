<p id="P31">Pharmacokinetic data were available for patients receiving 200 mg CC-486 doses, including 4 patients with and without concomitant medications after CC-486 dose administration on day 1 of cycles 1 and 2 (per protocol), 2 patients after CC-486 administration who had not taken concomitant medications, and 9 patients after CC-486 administration who had taken concomitant medications. Thus, azacitidine pharmacokinetic data were available at the CC-486 200-mg dose for a total of 6 patients without concomitant medications and 13 patients with concomitant medications. There were too few patients in the 150-mg/day CC-486 dosing group with meaningful pharmacokinetic data to report (pharmacokinetic outcomes with 300 mg QD CC-486 have been reported elsewhere [
