<p id="Par10">The following data were extracted: baseline characteristics, diagnosis (NHL subtype), number of mobilization visits and mobilization agents, adverse events, number and duration of apheresis sessions, total CD34+ cells collected and transplanted, transplantation outcome, and costs associated with mobilization, apheresis, and cryopreservation. Costs were estimated through interviews with local hospital administration at one study site in Cologne. Items included were (1) clinical chemistry costs prior to apheresis for CD34 levels, (2) day hospital stay for apheresis (3–4 h), (3) fixed costs for apheresis including medical supplies, solutes, harvest Kit, and overhead, (4) manipulation, cell engineering, materials costs, personal costs and storage for one bag of collected stem cells, (5) thawing costs for one bag of stem cells infused, including medical supplies, equipment amortization, personal costs (
