<p id="Par19">In patients with very low initial CD34+ count (≤10 cells/µl), the mean number of apheresis sessions, total apheresis volume, and time spent on apheresis significantly decreased in the plerixafor era (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The average yield after the first apheresis session increased from 1.5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/kg to 2.6 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/kg (
