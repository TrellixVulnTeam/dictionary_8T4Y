<p id="Par31">This study has several limitations: a narrow perspective was chosen with the main outcomes being time spent on apheresis and costs associated with apheresis. Costs for resources spent on mobilization and mobilization regimens were not included, nor were costs associated with transplantation and post-transplantation care considered. A direct comparison to other cost-effectiveness studies covering the entire ASCT process is therefore not possible. An additional limitation regards the relatively small number of patients included. In the subgroup of patients with initial CD34+ cell count of ≤10 cells/µl comprised 15 and 40 patients in the pre-plerixafor and plerixafor era, respectively. It should be noted that in this study, poor mobilizers not undergoing apheresis were excluded and therefore, the impact of plerixafor on all poor mobilizers cannot be evaluated. However, our results suggest that more patients with initial CD34+ cell count of ≤10 cells/µl were selected for HDC and ASCT upon introduction of plerixafor. In the subgroup of patients with initial CD34+ cell count &gt; 10 cells/µl, no statistically significant differences between the two eras were observed for any of the study endpoints (SI Table

The number of patients in this subgroup was however limited, preventing robust conclusions and suggesting that only few patients with initial CD34+ cell count &gt; 10 cells/µl received plerixafor pre-emptively, in line with the current practice in Germany (Fig.
