<p id="Par32">In conclusion, with the introduction of plerixafor in Germany, more patients with initial CD34+ cell count ≤ 10 cells/µl were considered for apheresis and subsequent transplantation. Time spent on apheresis and costs related to apheresis were significantly reduced in poor mobilizers with initial CD34+ cell count ≤ 10 cells/µl while there was no significant reduction in time and effort spent on apheresis in the overall population of poor mobilizers. A more modest effect of plerixafor on apheresis outcomes in Germany compared to other European countries might be due to reimbursement policies, patient characteristics, clinical practice or a mixture of different factors. Regardless of initial CD34+ cell count, more patients proceeded to transplantation in the plerixafor era as compared to the pre-plerixafor era. The results of this study consolidate the use of pre-emptive plerixafor in patients with initial CD34+ count ≤ 10 cells/µl. The impact of plerixafor on the rate of patients proceeding to transplantation deserves further study.</p>
