<p id="Par26">There are several possible reasons for a smaller effect size seen in the German setting: First, there might be differences in patient characteristics during the two time-periods. In the pre-plerixafor era, the initial CD34+ cell count was significantly higher than that observed in the plerixafor era (11.7/µl vs 7.1/µl; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The proportion of poor mobilizers with CD34+ count ≤ 10/µl was smaller in the pre-plerixafor era as compared to the plerixafor era: 15/39 (38%) vs 40/51 (78%) patients, respectively. It is hypothesized that prior to the introduction of plerixafor, hematologists were reluctant to carry out apheresis on patients with CD34+ count ≤ 10/µl because of the greater risk of collection failure. With the introduction of plerixafor, more of these patients were considered for apheresis leading to a population which was more difficult to mobilize. To account for differences in patient characteristics between the two eras, a subgroup analysis was carried out in patients with CD34+ count ≤ 10 cells/µl. In this population, the number of apheresis sessions per patient significantly decreased from 2.1 sessions in the pre-plerixafor era to 1.6 sessions in the plerixafor era (

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.04) and the CD34+ yield after first apheresis increased from 1.5 to 2.6 (
