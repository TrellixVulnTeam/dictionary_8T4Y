<p id="Par24">In a recent, multinational, non-interventional study the impact of plerixafor on poor mobilizers (CD34+ cell level &lt; 20/µl) was analyzed by comparing apheresis outcomes in the period prior and after introduction of plerixafor to the market. Overall, plerixafor reduced the average number of apheresis sessions per patient, and the average time spent on apheresis in poor mobilizers. However, country-specific differences were observed, with plerixafor having a lower impact on apheresis time and costs in Germany compared to the other sites. The goal of this study was therefore to re-analyze German specific data.</p>
