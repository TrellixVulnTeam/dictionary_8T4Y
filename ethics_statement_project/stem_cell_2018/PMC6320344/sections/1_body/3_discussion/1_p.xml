<p id="Par23">Plerixafor, a CXCR4 inhibitor increases the amount of circulating stem cells several folds when given in combination with conventional mobilization regimens. In Europe, plerixafor is approved in combination with G-CSF with or without chemotherapy in patients with multiple myeloma or lymphoma who are candidates for ASCT but whose cells mobilize poorly. The definition of poor mobilizers remains however vague and reflects the difficulty in defining the exact patient population for whom plerixafor may be considered cost-effective. The recent European position statement regarding autologous stem cell mobilization recommends the use of plerixafor in a dynamic way in patients with CD34+ cell count between 10–20 CD34+ cells/µl depending on patient characteristics and treatment history. In Germany and during the inclusion period of this study until 2014, most centers used plerixafor pre-emptively only in patients with a CD34+ count ≤ 10 cells/µl as schematically shown in Figure
