<p id="Par29">A threshold of 20 cells/µl for circulating CD34+ cells has initially been proposed to define poor mobilizers based on data by Pusic et al who showed a CD34+ cell count of at least 20 cells/µl was predictive of successful day 1 apheresis [

Other studies have found similar values, but a universal cut-off value has not been established as it depends on the mobilization regimen, treatment goals, and patient characteristics. Our data suggest that in Germany plerixafor significantly reduced costs and time spent on apheresis in patients with initial CD34+ count ≤ 10 cells/µl justifying the current management approach (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In comparison, data specific to France from the same study showed a significant reduction in apheresis costs and total time for the general population of poor mobilizers with CD34+ &lt; 20 cells/µl [
