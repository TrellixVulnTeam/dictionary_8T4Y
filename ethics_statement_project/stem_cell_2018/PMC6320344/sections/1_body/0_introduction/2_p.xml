Plerixafor antagonizes the interaction between stromal derived factor 1 and CXCR4 and by doing so interferes with homing of hematopoietic progenitor cells to the bone marrow. It was shown that plerixafor when given together with G-CSF, increased circulating PBSC several fold and could thereby rescue patients from mobilization failure when given together with conventional mobilization regimens [
