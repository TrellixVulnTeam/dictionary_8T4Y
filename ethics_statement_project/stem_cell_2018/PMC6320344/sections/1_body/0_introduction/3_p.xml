<p id="Par4">Current guidelines by American and European societies recommend the use of plerixafor in a pre-emptive way based on CD34+ cell count or as salvage therapy in case of low apheresis yield [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Due to the high cost of plerixafor, several institutions have published pharmacoeconomic analyses to identify the most cost-effective mobilization strategy. These studies have shown that plerixafor used in a pre-emptive way in patients identified as poor mobilizers decreased mobilization failure rate and increased the number of patients proceeding to transplantation at an acceptable additional cost [

Patients with a pre-apheresis CD34+ cell count &lt; 20 cell/µl are usually referred to as poor mobilizers, however, cut-off values may vary among institutions and countries as a consequence of different patient population, mobilization goals, chemotherapy regimens, and reimbursement policies. We recently carried out a non-interventional study to evaluate the impact of plerixafor on apheresis in poor mobilizers, i.e., patients with a CD34+ cell count &lt; 20 cell/µl. The study was carried out at 10 centers in France, Germany, and Italy. Overall, plerixafor reduced the mean number of apheresis sessions needed per patient, time spent on apheresis, and costs related to apheresis [
