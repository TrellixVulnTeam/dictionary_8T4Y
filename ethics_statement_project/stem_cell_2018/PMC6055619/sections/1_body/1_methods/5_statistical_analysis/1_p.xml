<p>Phase 1 enrolment was expected to be 12 patients. The sample size calculation for the phase 2 component was designed to test the null hypothesis of a CR + VGPR rate of 35% and the alternative hypothesis of a CR + VGPR rate of &gt;35%. With 80% power to reject the null hypothesis if the true CR + VGPR rate was 50% and a one‐sided significance level of α = 0·10, the required sample size was 48 patients. Patients enrolled at the RP2D in the phase 1 part of the study were included in the phase 2 part.</p>
