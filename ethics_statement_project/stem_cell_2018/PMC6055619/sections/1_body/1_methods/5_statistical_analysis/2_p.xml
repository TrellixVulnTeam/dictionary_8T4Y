<p>The safety population included all patients who received ≥1 dose of any study drug. The DLT‐evaluable population included patients in phase 1 who received all cycle 1 doses of ixazomib and completed all cycle 1 procedures, or who experienced a DLT during cycle 1. The response‐evaluable population comprised patients who had received ≥1 dose of study drug, had measurable disease at baseline and had ≥1 post‐baseline response assessment. Safety and efficacy were assessed among all patients, and in phase 2 patients, as well as in the modified intent‐to‐treat (mITT) population, which comprised phase 2 patients plus phase 1 patients treated at the RP2D. There was no formal statistical testing or analyses; all outcomes are reported with descriptive statistical analyses. DOR, PFS and OS were assessed using Kaplan–Meier methodology.</p>
