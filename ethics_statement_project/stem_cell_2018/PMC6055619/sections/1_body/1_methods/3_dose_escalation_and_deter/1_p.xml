<p>In phase 1, two fixed doses of ixazomib, 3·0 mg and 3·7 mg, were assessed. The starting dose was determined based on dose escalation in a phase 1 study of twice‐weekly single‐agent ixazomib in patients with RRMM (Richardson

 <xref rid="bjh15394-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), with the body surface area‐based dosing converted to fixed dosing based on results from population pharmacokinetics analysis (Gupta

 <xref rid="bjh15394-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2015a</xref>). Dose escalation proceeded via a standard 3 + 3 scheme, based on dose‐limiting toxicities (DLTs; see Table 
 <xref rid="bjh15394-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">SII</xref>) observed in cycle 1. Patients who did not receive all ixazomib doses during cycle 1 for reasons other than DLTs were replaced in the DLT‐evaluable cohort. The MTD was defined as the highest tolerated ixazomib dose at which no more than 1 of 6 DLT‐evaluable patients experienced a DLT in cycle 1. In phase 2, patients received ixazomib at the RP2D, which was selected based on all available data from the phase 1 portion including, but not limited to: analyses of efficacy results (response rates: CR and VGPR) and toxicity characterization (grade 3/4 adverse events [AEs], serious AEs [SAEs], all‐grade PN and treatment discontinuation).
