<p>Patients received oral ixazomib [administered on an empty stomach, ≥1 h before or ≥2 h after a meal (Gupta 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="bjh15394-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2016a</xref>)] on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of a 21‐day cycle, in combination with oral lenalidomide 25 mg on days 1–14 and oral dexamethasone 20 mg (10 mg in cycles 9–16) on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 12, for up to 16 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Doses of ixazomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone could be individually held or reduced in order to manage toxicities. While receiving Rd, all patients were required to take concurrent aspirin 81–325 mg/day (or enoxaparin 40 mg/day subcutaneously, or its equivalent) as anticoagulation prophylaxis. At the discretion of the investigator, patients could undergo stem cell collection after a minimum of four treatment cycles, and patients deemed transplant eligible by the treating physician could elect to stop treatment after a minimum of eight treatment cycles to proceed to autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) off study. Patients in both phases who were in response or had stable disease after 16 cycles of induction with ixazomib‐Rd could proceed to receive maintenance therapy with single‐agent ixazomib on the same schedule and at the last‐tolerated dose during induction until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who underwent ASCT did not receive ixazomib maintenance therapy post‐transplant.
