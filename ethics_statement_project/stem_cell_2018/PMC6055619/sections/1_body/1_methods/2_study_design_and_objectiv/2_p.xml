<p>The phase 1 primary objective was to determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of twice‚Äêweekly ixazomib in combination with Rd. Phase 1 secondary objectives were to characterize ixazomib plasma pharmacokinetics in combination with Rd, and to evaluate response rates. Phase 2 primary objectives were to determine the combined rate of complete response (CR) plus VGPR, and to further evaluate tolerability and toxicity. Phase 2 secondary objectives included further assessment of response rates, and determination of time to response, duration of response (DOR), PFS and OS.</p>
