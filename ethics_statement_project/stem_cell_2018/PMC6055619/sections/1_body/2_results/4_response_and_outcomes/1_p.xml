<p>Among all response‐evaluable patients, the ORR was 94%, including: CR + VGPR, 68%; CR, 24% (Table 
 <xref rid="bjh15394-tbl-0005" ref-type="table">5</xref>). In mITT response‐evaluable patients, the ORR was 95%, including: CR + VGPR, 68%; CR, 27%. A waterfall plot of best M‐protein responses (mITT population) is shown in Fig 
 <xref rid="bjh15394-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Of 6 patients with high‐risk cytogenetic abnormalities, 4 achieved a CR (duration, 38·5–51·3 months in the 3 patients with available follow‐up) and 1 achieved a partial response (PR). In the mITT population, the median time to first response was 0·7 months, and the median time to best response among patients achieving ≥PR, ≥VGPR and ≥CR was 1·9, 3·4 and 4·2 months, respectively. With 12 of 53 responding patients in the mITT population having had progression events, the median DOR was 36·9 months. Responses deepened over the course of treatment (Fig 
 <xref rid="bjh15394-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Among 18 patients receiving ixazomib maintenance therapy, 4 (22%) had improvement in depth of response during this phase (1 CR to stringent complete response [sCR]; 1 VGPR to CR; 2 VGPR to nCR).
