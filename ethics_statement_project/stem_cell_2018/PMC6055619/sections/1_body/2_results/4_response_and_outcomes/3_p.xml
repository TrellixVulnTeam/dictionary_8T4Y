<p>Among all 64 patients, 18 (28%) had a PFS event at the time of data cut‐off, and 46 (72%) were censored; patients who proceeded to ASCT were censored at their last response assessment. Median PFS was 24·9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 17·4–40·5). In the mITT population, 17 (30%) of 57 patients had a PFS event, and median PFS was 29·7 months (95% CI, 17·4–not estimable) (Fig 
 <xref rid="bjh15394-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). With a median follow‐up for survival of 46·9 months, median OS was not reached in the overall or mITT populations; the respective 3‐year OS estimates were 91% and 90%.
