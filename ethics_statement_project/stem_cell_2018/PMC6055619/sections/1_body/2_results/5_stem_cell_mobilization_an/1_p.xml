<p>Stem cell mobilization was conducted according to individual site protocol and was successful, with no failures, for 31 patients after a median of 7 (range 4–13) induction cycles; 18 (58%) and 13 (42%) patients underwent 1 and 2 apheresis procedures, respectively. The most commonly used mobilization regimen was granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor (G‐CSF) plus plerixafor (
