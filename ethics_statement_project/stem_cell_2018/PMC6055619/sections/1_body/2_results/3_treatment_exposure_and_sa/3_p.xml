<p>AEs led to dose reduction of any study drug in 66% of all patients, including new‐onset AEs resulting in dose reductions in 33% of patients who received ixazomib maintenance (Table 
 <xref rid="bjh15394-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The most common AEs resulting in dose reductions included PN NEC (

 <italic> </italic>3, 5%) reported in &gt;1 patient. Twelve (19%) patients (all with pre‐existing cardiac risk factors) reported AEs within the cardiac disorders system organ class, with only 4 of these patients reporting grade ≥3 AEs, and only 1 discontinuing treatment. Pre‐existing risk factors for these 4 patients with grade ≥3 AEs included: Patient 1, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, history of coronary artery bypass graft, and sinus bradycardia; Patient 2, fatigue, diabetes, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnoea and history of transient ischaemic attack; Patient 3 (discontinued treatment), atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, diastolic dysfunction, dyspnoea, high cholesterol and sinus tachycardia; Patient 4: obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia, dyspnoea, fatigue and atrial fibrillation. Five patients (8%) had peripheral embolism and thrombosis (grade 3,

 <italic> </italic>1). One patient in the phase 2 cohort died on study due to cardio‐respiratory arrest, which was probably secondary to a pulmonary embolism (PE), that was considered related to lenalidomide treatment.
