 <xref rid="bjh15394-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref> summarizes the overall safety profile of twice‐weekly ixazomib‐Rd. All patients except one experienced drug‐related AEs, which could have been related to any of the treatment drugs; 89% of patients who received single‐agent ixazomib maintenance experienced new‐onset drug‐related AEs during maintenance. Drug‐related grade 3 AEs were reported in 64% of patients, with new‐onset events reported in 28% of patients during maintenance. There were no drug‐related grade 4 AEs. Common drug‐related AEs are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="bjh15394-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>; common AEs regardless of attribution are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="bjh15394-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">SIII</xref>. The most common drug‐related AEs were PN NEC (59%), fatigue (48%), and rashes, eruptions and exanthems NEC (high‐level term incorporating the preferred terms of rash, macular rash, papular rash and maculo‐papular rash; 47%); new‐onset rates of these drug‐related AEs during single‐agent ixazomib maintenance were 28%, 11% and 17%, respectively. The most common drug‐related grade 3 events were rashes, eruptions and exanthems NEC (13%), hyperglycaemia (8%) and PN NEC (8%); respective new‐onset rates during maintenance were 6%, 0% and 6%. Changes in FACT/GOG‐Ntx score did not follow a consistent pattern (data not shown).
