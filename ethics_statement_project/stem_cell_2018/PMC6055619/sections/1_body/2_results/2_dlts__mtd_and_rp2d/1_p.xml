<p>In phase 1, 7 patients received ixazomib 3·0 mg and 7 patients received ixazomib 3·7 mg (1 patient at each dose was not DLT evaluable: at ixazomib 3·7 mg, cycle 1 was not completed; at ixazomib 3·0 mg, lenalidomide was taken for 21 days instead of 14 days per protocol). There were no DLTs reported at either dose; thus, with no further dose escalation, the MTD was 3·7 mg. For estimation of the RP2D, cycle 1 data from 12 evaluable patients were used in addition to the available clinical data supporting tolerance over multiple treatment cycles. AEs that met DLT criteria or that led to dose modification in cycle 2 and beyond were considered when determining the RP2D. Treatment exposure data showed that the median relative dose intensity (RDI) of lenalidomide (defined as the dose received divided by the dose prescribed, as a percentage) was 73·3% and 97·4% in patients who received ixazomib 3·7 and 3·0 mg, respectively. The RDI of lenalidomide was impacted by the higher dose of ixazomib as a result of overlapping toxicities such as rash, thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal toxicities (
