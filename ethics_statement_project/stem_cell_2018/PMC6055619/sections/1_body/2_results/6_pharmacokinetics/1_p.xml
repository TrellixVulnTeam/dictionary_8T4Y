<p>Thirteen patients were evaluable for pharmacokinetics. Ixazomib was rapidly absorbed; the median first observed time of maximum plasma concentration (

 <sub>max</sub>) was 1 h after dosing on both days 1 and 11. At the RP2D, the geometric mean (%CV [coefficient of variation]) 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> was 33·5 (57) ng/ml and 58·7 (32) ng/ml on days 1 and 11, respectively. The corresponding values for the area under the plasma concentration 
 <italic>versus</italic> time curve from 0–72 h post‐dose (AUC
 <sub>0–72</sub>) were 315 (23) h*ng/ml and 1110 (39) h*ng/ml, respectively.
