<p>Patients received a median of 9 treatment cycles with twice‐weekly ixazomib‐Rd, with median treatment duration limited by one‐third of patients discontinuing to undergo ASCT. Nevertheless, 30% and 14% of patients remained on ixazomib therapy for approximately 1 and 2 years, respectively. Together with the lack of cumulative toxicity seen with long‐term administration, including the limited new‐onset toxicity in patients receiving single‐agent ixazomib maintenance, these data demonstrate the tolerability and support the feasibility of long‐term treatment with this regimen.
