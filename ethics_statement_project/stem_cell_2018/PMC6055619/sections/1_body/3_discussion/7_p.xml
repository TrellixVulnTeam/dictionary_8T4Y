<p>Drug‐related PN NEC was reported in 59% of patients but was grade 3 in 8%. These rates of drug‐related PN NEC are higher than reported with weekly ixazomib‐Rd in NDMM (all grades, 38%; grade ≥3, 6%) (Kumar 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="bjh15394-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2014b</xref>). PN is an AE of clinical interest with respect to some proteasome inhibitors, and these findings should be viewed in the context of available data for other agents. Phase 3 evaluation of bortezomib‐Rd in patients with NDMM without intent for immediate ASCT reported 33% of patients with treatment‐related grade ≥3 neurological events (Durie 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="bjh15394-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). In a phase 2 study of bortezomib‐Rd in patients with NDMM, grade 1/2 PN occurred in 55% of patients, and grade ≥3 neuropathy in 17% of patients (Kumar 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="bjh15394-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Phase 1/2 evaluation of bortezomib‐Rd in patients with NDMM reported sensory neuropathy in 80% of patients (2% grade 3) and motor neuropathy in 18% of patients (2% grade 3) (Richardson 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="bjh15394-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). A phase 1/2 study of KRd in NDMM reported treatment‐emergent PN (all grade ≤2) during induction (cycles 1–8) in 23% of patients; during maintenance, PN remained limited (11%; all grade ≤2); most neuropathic events were attributed to lenalidomide (Jakubowiak 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="bjh15394-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Limited additional PN was seen with ixazomib‐Rd 
 <italic>versus</italic> placebo‐Rd in the TOURMALINE‐MM1 study in RRMM, consistent with lenalidomide being associated with neuropathic events (Moreau 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="bjh15394-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>).
