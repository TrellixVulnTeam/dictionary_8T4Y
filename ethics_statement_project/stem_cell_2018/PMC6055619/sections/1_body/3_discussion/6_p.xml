<p>Rashes, eruptions and exanthems NEC were seen in a substantial number of patients, but were mainly low grade, were not reported as DLTs and proved manageable with dose modifications (including reductions or holding of either lenalidomide or ixazomib, whichever was the causative agent) and oral or topical antihistamines, as required. The occurrence of rash events probably represents an overlapping effect of lenalidomide (Tinsley

The rate of 47% for drug‐related, any‐grade rashes, eruptions and exanthems reported here is higher than the rate of 29% reported for this high‐level term in the parallel phase 1/2 study investigating weekly ixazomib‐Rd in patients with NDMM (Takeda, unpublished data, February 2017). It is difficult to put these data into context with safety findings for other proteasome inhibitors due to differences in how rash events have been reported (in aggregate, or as individual preferred terms). For example, a phase 1/2 study of bortezomib‐Rd in patients with NDMM reported the incidence of all‐grade and grade 3 rash/desquamation as 36% and 2%, respectively (Richardson
