<p>Drug‐related grade 3 AEs were experienced by 64% of all patients, with no grade 4 drug‐related AEs reported; only 28% of patients proceeding to maintenance reported new‐onset drug‐related grade 3 AEs during maintenance with single‐agent ixazomib. AEs led to dose reductions (of any agent) or discontinuation in 66% and 20% of patients, respectively. AE rates reported here appear similar to those seen in the parallel study of weekly ixazomib‐Rd in patients with NDMM, but dose reductions and discontinuations due to AEs were lower with weekly ixazomib dosing (57% and 8%, respectively) (Kumar

 <xref rid="bjh15394-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2014b</xref>). The AE profile reported here was largely expected based on clinical experience with each drug in this triplet regimen. The most common drug‐related AEs were PN NEC (high‐level term), fatigue, rashes, eruptions and exanthems NEC (high‐level term) and nausea; the majority of these AEs were grade 1 or 2.
