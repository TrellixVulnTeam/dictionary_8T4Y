<p>The RP2D of twice‐weekly oral ixazomib plus Rd in patients with NDMM was 3·0 mg. At this dose level the ORR was 95%, including 68% CR + VGPR and 27% CR. Responses were rapid, deep and durable, deepening over the course of treatment. Median PFS was 29·7 months. The combination had no deleterious effects on the ability to collect stem cells for transplant, and engraftment kinetics, where available, did not suggest any adverse effect. This was the first study to evaluate twice‐weekly ixazomib‐Rd for 16 cycles (48 weeks), followed by a period of single‐agent ixazomib maintenance. The regimen was generally well tolerated and long‐term therapy was feasible with 28% of patients continuing on therapy beyond 16 cycles and proceeding to maintenance. Among all 64 patients, 64% had grade 3 drug‐related AEs; there were no grade 4 drug‐related AEs. New‐onset drug‐related grade 3 AEs during maintenance therapy with single‐agent ixazomib were limited. Pharmacokinetic data were similar to other studies suggesting no pharmacokinetic interaction of ixazomib with Rd (
