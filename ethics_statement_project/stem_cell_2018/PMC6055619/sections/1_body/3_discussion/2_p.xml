<p>While the MTD for twice‐weekly ixazomib‐Rd in patients with NDMM was determined to be 3·7 mg, the RP2D was 3·0 mg based on overall tolerability across multiple cycles, including an elevated rate of rash with 3·7 mg (Kumar

 <xref rid="bjh15394-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2014d</xref>). Additionally, the RDI of lenalidomide was impacted by the higher 3·7 mg dose of ixazomib as a result of overlapping toxicities, such as rash, thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal toxicities (

 <xref rid="bjh15394-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2014d</xref>). This finding is similar to results from a parallel study investigating weekly ixazomib‐Rd in patients with NDMM in which the lenalidomide RDI was 96% and 84·6% in patients who received ixazomib at an approximate fixed dose of 4·0 mg and 5·5 mg, respectively (Kumar

 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="bjh15394-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2017b</xref>). Consequently, 4·0 mg ixazomib was the dose selected for phase 3 evaluation of weekly ixazomib‐Rd (Gupta

 <xref rid="bjh15394-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2017b</xref>). The RP2D of 3·0 mg determined here for twice‐weekly ixazomib‐Rd is lower than the RP2D of 4·0 mg reported in the parallel study investigating weekly ixazomib‐Rd in patients with NDMM (Kumar 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="bjh15394-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2014b</xref>). Although the twice‐weekly regimen represents a more intensive ixazomib dosing schedule compared with weekly dosing, the 21‐day cycle used in the present study represents a less intensive schedule for Rd, with lenalidomide dosed on days 1–14 compared with days 1–21 in the weekly ixazomib‐Rd study (Kumar
