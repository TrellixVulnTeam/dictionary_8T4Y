<p>The oral proteasome inhibitor ixazomib is approved in various countries, including the United States and in Europe, in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) for the treatment of patients with MM who have received at least one prior therapy. Ixazomib approval was based on the findings of the global, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled phase 3 TOURMALINE‐MM1 study (NCT01564537). In adult patients with RRMM, the combination of weekly ixazomib‐Rd demonstrated significantly longer PFS, with limited additional toxicity, compared with placebo‐Rd; responses to ixazomib‐Rd were rapid and durable, deepening with increasing duration of treatment (Moreau
