 <title>Summary</title>
 <p>Weekly ixazomib with lenalidomide‐dexamethasone (Rd) is feasible and has shown activity in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">NDMM</styled-content>) patients. This phase 1/2 study (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">NCT</styled-content>01383928) evaluated the recommended phase 2 dose (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">RP</styled-content>2D), pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of twice‐weekly ixazomib plus Rd in 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">NDMM</styled-content>; 64 patients were enrolled across both phases. Patients received twice‐weekly oral ixazomib 3·0 or 3·7 mg plus lenalidomide 25 mg and dexamethasone 20 mg (10 mg in cycles 9–16) for up to sixteen 21‐day cycles, followed by maintenance with twice‐weekly ixazomib alone. No dose‐limiting toxicities were reported in cycle 1; the 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">RP</styled-content>2D was 3·0 mg based on overall tolerability across multiple cycles. In 62 evaluable patients, the confirmed overall response rate was 94% (68% ≥very good partial response; 24% complete response). Median progression‐free survival was 24·9 months. Responses (median duration 36·9 months for patients receiving the 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">RP</styled-content>2D) deepened during treatment. Grade 3 drug‐related adverse events (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">AE</styled-content>s) occurred in 64% of patients, including: rash, 13%; peripheral neuropathy, 8%; hyperglycaemia, 8%. There were no grade 4 drug‐related 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">AE</styled-content>s. Thirteen patients discontinued due to 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">AE</styled-content>s. Twice‐weekly ixazomib‐Rd offers substantial activity with promising long‐term outcomes in 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">NDMM</styled-content> patients but may be associated with greater toxicity compared with weekly ixazomib‐Rd in this setting.
