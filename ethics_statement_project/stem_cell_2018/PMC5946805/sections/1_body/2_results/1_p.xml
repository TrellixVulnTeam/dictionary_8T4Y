<p id="para340">Between June 18, 2012, and Nov 16, 2016, we randomly assigned 87 patients to study treatment, 43 to CHOP and 44 to GEM-P (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Before the formal interim analysis, interim results from a planned unmasked independent review of efficacy data by the independent data monitoring committee in November, 2016, showed that fewer patients had achieved a complete response or unconfirmed complete response with GEM-P than with CHOP. The committee concluded there was a high likelihood that GEM-P would be inferior to CHOP at the end of the trial, as indicated by the one-sided 80% CI for difference. The trial was subsequently closed to recruitment and all patients treated in the GEM-P group were offered the option to change to CHOP off-study at the time of study closure as per the recommendations of the data monitoring committee and trial management group. The last dose of study treatment on trial was administered on Feb 23, 2017.
