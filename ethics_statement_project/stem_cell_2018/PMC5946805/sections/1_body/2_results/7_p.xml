<p id="para400">Survival was assessed in the ITT population (84 patients [97%] of 87). Three patients (two in the CHOP group, one in the GEM-P group) were excluded from the ITT population following treatment assignment, two because of a change in diagnosis from peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified to Hodgkin's lymphoma after randomisation and a third patient was deemed to be ineligible following treatment assignment because of cardiac impairment. 2-year progression-free survival was 38·0% (95% CI 22·9–52·9) in the GEM-P group and 36·6% (21·4–52·0) in the CHOP group (HR 1·07, 95% CI 0·61–1·85, p=0·82;

Two patients (2%) of 84 had CNS relapses (both isolated CNS recurrences); both patients had peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified, were treated with CHOP, and developed progression in the CNS after cycle 1 and cycle 5, respectively. 2-year overall survival was 63·9% (95% CI 45·7–77·4) in the GEM-P group and 51·0% (32·8–67·4) in the CHOP group (HR 0·69, 95% CI 0·35–1·38, p=0·30;
