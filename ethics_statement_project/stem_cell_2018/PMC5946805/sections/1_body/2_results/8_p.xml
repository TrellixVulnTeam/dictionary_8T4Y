<p id="para410">Significant risk factors associated with superior overall survival in univariable analysis (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 6</xref>) were a complete response or unconfirmed complete response on completion of treatment determined by CT, a complete response on completion of treatment determined by 
 <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT, and autologous stem-cell transplantation consolidation in first remission. No factor remained independently prognostic for overall survival in multivariable analysis (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p7</xref>). Presence of raised lactate dehydrogenase, an International Prognostic Index score of more than 1, and presence of more than one extranodal site was associated with inferior progression-free survival in univariable analysis (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 8</xref>), while patients with a complete response or unconfirmed complete response to induction determined by CT or a complete response to induction determined by 
 <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT or undergoing autologous stem-cell transplantation consolidation in first remission had superior progression-free survival. In multivariable analysis presence of raised lactate dehydrogenase concentrations at diagnosis was independently associated with inferior progression-free survival; by contrast, attainment of a complete response by 
 <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT to study treatment or presence of a low or low-intermediate risk international prognostic index score was independently associated with superior progression-free survival (
