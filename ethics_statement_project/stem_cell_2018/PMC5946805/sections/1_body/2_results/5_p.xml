<p id="para380">Investigator-assessed end of treatment response by contrast-enhanced CT was available for 74 patients (37 in each group; 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). At a median follow-up of 27·4 months (IQR 16·6–38·4), 23 patients (62%) of 37 assigned to CHOP had achieved a complete response or unconfirmed complete response compared with 17 (46%) of 37 assigned to GEM-P (OR 0·52, 95% CI 0·21–1·31; p=0·164; adjusted OR for stratification factors 0·53 (0·19–1·46, p=0·22). Given the higher proportion of patients with stage IV disease in the GEM-P group versus CHOP, the logistic regression was adjusted for stage as well as for stratification variables, but this did not make any difference to the complete response outcome by randomisation result (OR 0·50, 95% CI 0·18–1·40; p=0·19). Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint in both the ITT and per-protocol populations showed no differences between the treatment groups (
