 <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT substudy, 79 (91%) of 87 patients assessed had FDG-avid disease at baseline on central review of imaging. End-of-treatment response by 
 <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT or CT was assessable in 70 patients (89%) of 79 (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 10</xref>); although the incidence of complete response as determined by 
 <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT was lower in the GEM-P group than in the CHOP group, the difference between groups was less marked than between-group differences for complete response assessment by contrast-enhanced CT. The proportion of agreement between 
 <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT and contrast-enhanced CT for determining a complete response was 77Â·3%. For 40 patients with a complete response by 
 <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT on completion of study treatment, the corresponding contrast-enhanced CT data were: 24 (60%) with a complete response, seven (18%) with an unconfirmed complete response, five (13%) with a partial response, two (5%) with stable disease, and two (5%) with progressive disease.
