<p id="para200">Patients were assessed at baseline, at each attendance for treatment, 30 days after completion of treatment, and subsequently every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months until year 2, and every year thereafter for a maximum follow-up of 5 years. Laboratory monitoring with a full blood-cell count (haemoglobin, white cells, neutrophils, and platelets) and biochemistry (sodium, potassium, urea, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, lactate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, serum albumin, and blood glucose concentrations) were done at baseline, on each day of treatment, and at 30 days after completion of study treatment. At baseline all patients had a contrast enhanced CT scan of the neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvis and an 
 <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT scan done within 28 days of randomisation, and a bone marrow biopsy was required within 6 weeks of randomisation. CT scans were also required during treatment (after cycles 2 and 4 for patients on CHOP and after cycles 1 and 3 for patients on GEM-P). Both a contrast enhanced CT scan and an 
 <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT scan were done at the end of treatment. Any clinical suspicion of relapse or progression was confirmed radiologically or on bone marrow aspirate or trephine if disease was marrow-based only.
