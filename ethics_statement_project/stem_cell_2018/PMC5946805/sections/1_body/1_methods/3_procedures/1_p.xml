<p id="para160">Patients in the CHOP group received cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup>, doxorubicin 50 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup>, and vincristine 1·4 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> (up to a maximum of 2 mg) intravenously on day 1, and oral prednisolone 100 mg on days 1–5 every 21 days, for six cycles. Patients in the GEM-P group received intravenous gemcitabine 1000 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> on days 1, 8, and 15, intravenous cisplatin 100 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> on day 15, and oral or intravenous methylprednisolone 1000 mg on days 1–5 every 28 days, for four cycles. The rationale for administering four cycles of GEM-P (rather than six cycles) was that because GEM-P is a platinum-based regimen used mainly for patients with relapsed or refractory disease, we anticipated that most patients would have achieved a maximum response with this type of regimen by the fourth cycle.
