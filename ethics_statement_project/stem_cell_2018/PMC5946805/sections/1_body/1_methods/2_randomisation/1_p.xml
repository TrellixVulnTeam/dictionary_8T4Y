<p id="para150">We assigned patients (1:1) to either CHOP or GEM-P. Randomisation was done centrally by the clinical trials unit at the Institute for Cancer Research (ICR) independently of the trial team and investigators using a minimisation procedure from the beginning of the trial and first patient, without a burn-in period. The stratification variables of locally-determined histological subtype and International Prognostic Index risk group (low 0–1 
 <italic>vs</italic> intermediate 2–3 
 <italic>vs</italic> high 4–5) were used for computer-based minimisation. We factored in a probability component (ie, 80% chance of an incoming patient being allocated to an unbalanced group). Given the differences in the administration schedules between the chemotherapy regimens under assessment, it was not possible to mask patients to the treatment they were receiving.
