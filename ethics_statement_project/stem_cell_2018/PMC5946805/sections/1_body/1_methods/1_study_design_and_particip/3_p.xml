<p id="para130">For participation in the study, patients were required to have bulky stage I (tumour mass diameter &gt;10 cm) to stage IV disease; a WHO performance status of 0–3 (patients with a performance status of 3 were only eligible if this was deemed to be related to a lymphoma); adequate cardiac, renal, hepatic, and bone marrow function (absolute neutrophil count ≥1·0 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L, white blood cell count ≥3·0 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L, platelet count ≥100·0 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L, and haemoglobin concentration ≥9·0 g/dL unless related to disease). Patients with CNS or leptomeningeal involvement, positive serology for HIV-1, active hepatitis B or C, or a history of malignancy within the preceding 5 years (with the exception of curatively treated skin cancers or carcinoma in situ of the cervix) and poorly controlled diabetes or other comorbidities which would preclude the safe delivery of treatment within the trial, were ineligible, as were patients without at least one site of measurable disease at baseline (measurable in two perpendicular dimensions and ≥1 cm on the longest diameter on contrast-enhanced CT scan, except for patients with enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma following complete surgical resection). Corticosteroids, not exceeding a maximum of prednisolone 100 mg/day (or equivalent corticosteroid dose) for 7 days, for symptoms related to lymphoma before starting study treatment were permitted, but preferably not instituted before an 
 <sup>18</sup>F-fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) PET-CT scan at baseline. If corticosteroids were instituted before the baseline scan, they were required to be discontinued 24 h beforehand and patients were required to have a serum glucose concentration of 8·0 mmol/L or lower immediately before the scan.
