 </xref> A secondary endpoint assessing 
 <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT response specifically was deemed to be of particular importance at the time of study design, as the role of this outcome in peripheral T-cell lymphoma had not previously been assessed in a dedicated, prospective cohort of patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma. All patients receiving at least one dose of study medication were included in the safety analysis and analysed as treated. The severity of adverse events was defined according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. The worst toxicity per organ per patient was considered.
