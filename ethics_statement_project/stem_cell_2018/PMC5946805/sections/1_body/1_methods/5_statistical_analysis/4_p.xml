<p id="para300">In the planned subgroup analysis, we used logistic regression to assess treatment differences in responses within the predefined subgroups, with results displayed as ORs in a Forest plot. Progression events were defined as clinical or radiological documented disease progression or death from any cause. Patients recording no event were censored at the last follow-up date. Progression-free survival and overall survival were calculated from the date of randomisation until a progression or death event occurred, respectively, using Kaplan-Meier methods and compared between groups using a log-rank test. Additionally, a Cox proportional hazards model was fitted to adjust for the stratification variables and to calculate a hazard ratio (HR [95% CI]) for CHOP versus GEM-P. The ITT population was used for survival analyses.</p>
