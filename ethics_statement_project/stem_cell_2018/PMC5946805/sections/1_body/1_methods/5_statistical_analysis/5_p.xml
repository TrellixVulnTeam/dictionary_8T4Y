<p id="para310">We assessed the following factors affecting overall survival and progression-free survival using Cox regression analysis in the ITT population combining both treatment groups: age, sex, disease stage, WHO performance status, B symptoms, presence of raised lactate dehydrogenase, International Prognostic Index risk group, subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, number of extranodal sites, treatment arm, local CT response after study chemotherapy, central 
 <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT response after study chemotherapy, and autologous stem-cell transplantation following first-line treatment. For safety analyses, the proportion of patients reporting toxicities of grade 3 or worse was compared between groups using a Ï‡
