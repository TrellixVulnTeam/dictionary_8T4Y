<p id="para280">A planned formal interim analysis with 90% power to show non-inferiority for review by an independent data monitoring committee was due after the first 51 patients in each group had been assessed for end-of-treatment response; however, this milestone was not reached as the trial closed before accruing 51 patients per group. A lower 90% one-sided CI of difference in the number of patients achieving a confirmed or unconfirmed complete response between treatments was expected to be greater than 25% (ie, a non-inferiority margin of 25%).</p>
