<p id="para270">We calculated the patient sample size for this trial estimating that 50% of patients in the CHOP group and 70% of patients in the GEM-P group would achieve a complete response or unconfirmed complete response by CT, with an odds ratio of 2Â·33. We calculated that 93 patients per group were required to detect this difference with 5% significance (two-sided) and 80% power. Continuity correction was not used.</p>
