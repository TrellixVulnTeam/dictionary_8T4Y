<p id="para490">Although our study closed early to recruitment, this phase 2 trial is an important addition to the prospective evidence-base for this rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and is, to our knowledge, the third randomised trial reported with treatment-naive patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma. All participants had the diagnosis and subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma confirmed centrally by two expert lymphoma pathologists; for around 23% of patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma the subtype was revised, highlighting that there are challenges to accurately diagnosing peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Additionally, although extensive future work is necessary, our study reports, to our knowledge, the first dedicated prospective trial to assess 
 <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT responses in patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, all of which were done at accredited sites, underwent central quality control, and were centrally assessed by an expert 
 <sup>18</sup>F FDG PET-CT physician. Our study also adds important data from a prospective trial cohort on the incidence of CNS relapse in peripheral T-cell lymphoma, which at the time of writing has been reported in two patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified and occurred during study treatment.
