<p id="para540">Our study confirms the poor outcomes for patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma in the setting of a prospective randomised trial.
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Recruitment to the trial was closed early as there was strong evidence that the primary endpoint—to detect superiority of GEM-P over CHOP by a comparison of the CT-based complete responses and unconfirmed complete responses at end of treatment—would not be met, although this was not reflected in inferior progression-free survival or overall survival at 2 years in the GEM-P group. More patients also withdrew from the GEM-P group than from the CHOP group for reasons other than disease progression. The dose of cisplatin 100 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> administered in GEM-P was associated with more grade 1–2 tinnitus (compared with CHOP), which led three patients to withdraw early before completing study treatment; this dose therefore appears to be at the upper limit of what is tolerable in terms of ototoxicity, but further assessment of the dosing limit would be necessary to establish tolerability. Nevertheless, we have revised the dose of cisplatin administered with GEM-P at The Royal Marsden Hospital (London, UK) to a total dose of 75 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup>, in line with the dose used in other regimens containing gemcitabine and platinum,
