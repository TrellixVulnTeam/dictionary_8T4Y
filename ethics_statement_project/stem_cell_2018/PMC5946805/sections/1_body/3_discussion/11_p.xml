<p id="para550">Although our data show that GEM-P has efficacy in terms of response and survival in peripheral T-cell lymphoma, in our randomised study it was inferior to CHOP for treatment-naive patients with this disease. One possible exception for the use of this type of regimen upfront might be when front-line anthracycline-based chemotherapy is contraindicated to avoid cardiotoxicity. In conclusion, although further studies are warranted, our phase 2 randomised trial suggests that CHOP should, for the time being, remain the reference regimen for previously untreated patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma and that GEM-P is best reserved for the relapsed and refractory setting at present.</p>
