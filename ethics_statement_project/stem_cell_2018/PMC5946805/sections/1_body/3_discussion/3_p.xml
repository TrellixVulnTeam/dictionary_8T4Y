<p id="para470">Relative dose intensity was lower in the GEM-P group than in the CHOP group, although this might mainly reflect the dose modifications that were required with the GEM-P regimen according to blood results on the day of treatment. However, there were two separate instances where a day of GEM-P treatment was incorrectly omitted rather than delayed, resulting in two protocol violations, although it seems unlikely that this modification would have significantly negatively affected the primary endpoint assessment in the GEM-P arm. At the median follow-up of 27Â·4 months there was no difference in either 2-year progression-free survival or overall survival between the treatment groups. In a Cox regression analysis of the ITT population, significant risk factors associated with superior overall survival included a complete response at end of treatment determined either by CT or by 
 <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT, and autologous stem-cell transplantation consolidation in first remission in univariable analysis. However, no factors remained independently significant for overall survival in multivariable analysis. In multivariable analysis of the factors associated with progression-free survival, presence of a raised lactate dehydrogenase concentration at presentation was prognostic of inferior progression-free survival, whereas a low or low-intermediate risk international prognostic index score or a complete response to study treatment determined by 
 <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT was independently associated with superior progression-free survival.
