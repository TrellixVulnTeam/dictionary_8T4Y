<p id="para480">The number of patients who withdrew from the study for reasons other than disease progression was higher in the GEM-P group than in the CHOP group, and consequently more patients receiving GEM-P proceeded to second-line chemotherapy. This might explain the absence of a survival difference between arms at this time, as the numbers undergoing autologous stem-cell transplantation in first remission were similar between groups, although this remains to be further investigated. However, given that the inferior incidence of complete responses and unconfirmed complete responses in the GEM-P group was not associated with inferior progression-free survival or overall survival for these patients, complete response (particularly when assessed by contrast-enhanced CT) might not be an accurate surrogate endpoint in peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Future studies in this area should therefore better investigate this point, and perhaps should be designed with primary endpoints that incorporate survival. Indeed, measuring endpoints such as 24-month event-free survival in peripheral T-cell lymphoma might be an important predictor of overall survival; one study showed that patients achieving 24-month event-free survival had superior overall survival compared with those who did not reach this milestone.
