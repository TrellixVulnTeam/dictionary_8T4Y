<p id="para460">As part of a preplanned analysis, we also assessed the proportion of agreement between contrast-enhanced CT and 
 <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT for determining a complete response, and found it to be around 77%. This discrepancy was probably mainly due to the presence of persistent non-FDG-avid nodes discernible on contrast-enhanced CT after chemotherapy and 
 <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT might be better able to distinguish between a residual fibrotic mass following chemotherapy versus viable tumour in peripheral T-cell lymphoma. The rate of early withdrawal before completing study treatment for reasons other than disease progression was higher in the GEM-P group with more participants withdrawing for toxicity and by choice; there were also two deaths on treatment with GEM-P, both due to lung infections. Patients treated in the CHOP group had more febrile neutropenia than those in the GEM-P group; by contrast, patients treated with GEM-P had more thrombocytopenia of all grades and grade 3 or worse than those treated with CHOP, although this did not lead to a substantial increase in bleeding events. GEM-P was also associated with a significant increased risk of grade 1-2 tinnitus, which led two patients to withdraw early from the study.
