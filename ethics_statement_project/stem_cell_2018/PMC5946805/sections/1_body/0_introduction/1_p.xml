<p id="para10">Peripheral T-cell lymphoma is a rare and heterogeneous subgroup of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and comprises approximately 10% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas in Europe and America.

 </xref> Randomised prospective trials in patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma are scarce and hence there is no consensus on the optimal chemotherapy for previously untreated patients, although combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) is widely used, with consolidative autologous stem-cell transplantation considered in eligible patients. However, for most patients, outcomes with CHOP are poor, with only 33% to 43% achieving a complete response

 </xref> therefore, a superior upfront regimen for peripheral T-cell lymphoma is urgently required. Previous evidence suggested that the addition of etoposide to CHOP (CHOEP) might improve event-free survival for younger patients (aged ≤60 years) without increased lactate dehydrogenase,
