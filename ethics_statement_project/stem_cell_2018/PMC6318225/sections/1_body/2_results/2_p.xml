<p id="para380">The median follow-up after randomisation for this analysis was 31 months (IQR 18–50). For the primary analyses, 456 (40%) of 1137 patients in the lenalidomide group and 533 (64%) of 834 patients in the observation group had disease progression or died. Median progression-free survival was 39 months (95% CI 36–42) with lenalidomide and 20 months (18–22) with observation (HR 0·46 [95% CI 0·41–0·53]; p&lt;0·0001;

A sensitivity analysis including those patients who had disease progression before maintenance randomisation, in which events were defined at the time of maintenance randomisation rather than being censored at the time of maintenance randomisation, gave similar results (
