<p id="para410">At the time of analysis, the median duration of lenalidomide maintenance therapy was 18 cycles (IQR 6–30). Dose modifications were applied to 781 (69%) of 1137 patients allocated to lenalidomide treatment. Reasons for discontinuing in the 594 patients who had ceased lenalidomide maintenance were disease progression or death in 320 (54%) patients, adverse events in 167 (28%) patients, patient preference in 45 (8%) patients, other reasons for 43 (7%) patients, and unknown reasons for 19 (3%) patients. Adverse events were assessed in the 1097 patients who completed at least one dose of study drug (

The most common grade 3 or 4 haematological adverse reactions in the lenalidomide group were neutropenia in 362 (33%) patients, thrombocytopenia in 72 (7%) patients, and anaemia in 42 (4%) patients. Serious adverse events were reported in 494 (45%) of 1097 patients receiving lenalidomide compared with 150 (17%) of 874 patients on observation (

The overall incidence of second primary malignancies per 100 patient-years was 2·4 (95% CI 1·9–3·1) in the lenalidomide group and 1·4 (1·0–2·0) in the observation group. The 3-year cumulative incidence of deaths related to second primary malignancies was low in both groups (2·0% [95% CI 0·9–3·1] in the lenalidomide group
