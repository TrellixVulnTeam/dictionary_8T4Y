<p id="para460">In the subgroup analysis of overall survival (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5A</xref>), there was significant heterogeneity in outcomes based on pathway for previous induction treatment (p
 <sub>heterogeneity</sub>=0·0445) and age (p
 <sub>heterogeneity</sub>=0·0442), with age probably acting as a surrogate for transplantation pathway eligibility. A significant improvement in overall survival was seen in transplantation-eligible patients treated with lenalidomide compared with those assigned to observation (3-year overall survival in transplant-eligible patients 87·5% [95% Cl 84·3–90·7] with lenalidomide and 80·2% [76·0–84·4] with observation; HR 0·69 [95% CI 0·52–0·93]; p=0·014; 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5B</xref>). However, lenalidomide maintenance therapy did not improve overall survival in transplantation-ineligible patients (3-year overall survival 66·8% [61·6–72·1] with lenalidomide and 69·8% [64·4–75·2] with observation; HR 1·02 [95% CI 0·80–1·29]; p=0·88; 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5C</xref>). The benefit of lenalidomide maintenance therapy on overall survival in the transplantation-eligible patients was also confirmed across subgroups based on age, disease stage, induction therapy, and response at baseline (

 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 15–22</xref>). By cytogenetic risk group, in standard-risk patients, 3-year overall survival was 86·4% (95% CI 80·0–90·9) in the lenalidomide group compared with 81·3% (74·2–86·7] in the observation group, and in high-risk patients, it was 74·9% (65·8–81·9) in the lenalidomide group compared with 63·7% (52·8–72·7) in the observation group; and in ultra-high-risk patients it was 62·9% (46·0–75·8) compared with 43·5% (22·2–63·1).
