<p id="para470">A significant improvement in progression-free survival 2 was seen with lenalidomide maintenance in transplantation-eligible patients (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">figure 6A</xref>) and in transplantation-ineligible patients (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">figure 6B</xref>). In transplantation-eligible patients, median progression-free survival was not reached for the lenalidomide group and 59 months (95% CI 52–not reached) for the observation group (HR 0·57, 95% CI 0·44–0·73; p&lt;0·0001); and for transplant-ineligible patients it was 43 months (39–48) for the lenalidomide group and 35 months (31–39) for the observation group (HR 0·72, 0·58–0·88; p=0·0016). A post-hoc analysis of progression-free survival 2 with lenalidomide compared with observation in different patient groups is shown in
