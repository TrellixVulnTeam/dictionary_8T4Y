<p id="para450">For the prespecified subgroup analysis by cytogenetic risk group, the baseline characteristics between patients with (774 [39%] of 1971) and without (1197 [61%] of 1971) cytogenetic data available were balanced (

 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 9</xref>); the benefit of lenalidomide was also seen across these risk categories when the intention-to-treat population was divided into transplantation-eligible and transplantation-ineligible patients, with no significant heterogeneity between genetic subgroups (p
 <sub>heterogeneity</sub>=0·98 for transplantation-eligible patients, p
 <sub>heterogeneity</sub>=0·76 for transplantation-ineligible patients; 
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 10–11</xref>). Similar results for progression-free survival were seen if the definition of high risk was restricted to patients with t(4;14), t(4;14) and del(17p), or del(17p) compared with those without either t(4;14) or del(17p), independently of transplantation eligibility (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 12–14</xref>). Further subgroup analyses of progression-free survival by induction treatment and transplantation status also showed a benefit for lenalidomide maintenance compared with observation regardless of sex, age, disease stage, and response at baseline (
