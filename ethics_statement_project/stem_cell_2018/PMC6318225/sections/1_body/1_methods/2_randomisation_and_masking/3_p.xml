<p id="para200">Patients completing induction and intensification treatment (where applicable) and eligible were randomly assigned (1:1) to lenalidomide maintenance or observation. A minimisation algorithm was used to avoid chance imbalances in three variables: allocated induction treatment (CTD 
 <italic>vs</italic> CRD 
 <italic>vs</italic> attenuated CTD 
 <italic>vs</italic> attenuated CRD), allocated intensification treatment (no CVD 
 <italic>vs</italic> CVD 
 <italic>vs</italic> not randomised at intensification randomisation), and centre. Following a protocol amendment on Sept 14, 2011, and after accrual of 442 patients under protocol versions 2.0 to 4.0, patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to lenalidomide, lenalidomide plus vorinostat, or observation. A similar minimisation algorithm was used to avoid chance imbalances in the same three variables with the same categories. Following a protocol amendment on June 28, 2013, and after accrual of 615 further patients under protocol version 5.0, patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to lenalidomide or observation. A similar minimisation algorithm was used to avoid chance imbalances in the same three variables with the same categories but with the addition of KCRD to the induction treatment options. These changes were made to add and remove research questions in this adaptive design study.
