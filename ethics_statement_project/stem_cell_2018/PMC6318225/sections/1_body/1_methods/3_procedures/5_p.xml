<p id="para260">Cytogenetic risk profiling was performed by use of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and quantitative real-time PCR using DNA and RNA respectively, which was extracted from CD138-selected plasma cells from bone marrow biopsy samples taken before treatment initiation. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to assess the expression of translocation gene partners including t(4;14):
 <italic>MMSET, FGFR3</italic>, t(14;16):
 <italic>MAF</italic>, and t(14;20):
 <italic>MAFB</italic>. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification was used to assess copy number aberrations by including probe sets at sites of the commonly deleted or amplified regions in myeloma (eg, at genes 
 <italic>CKS1B</italic> on 1q21.3 and 
 <italic>TP53</italic> on 17p13). These techniques are validated and provide equivalent results to interphase fluorescence in-situ hybridisation.

 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Patients were classified into three cytogenetic risk groups for the preplanned analysis of outcomes: standard risk (no adverse cytogenetic abnormalities), high risk (one adverse cytogenetic abnormality), or ultra-high risk (two or more adverse cytogenetic abnormalities). Adverse cytogenetic abnormalities were defined as gain(1q), t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), or del(17p).
