 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). There were three potential randomisations in the study: at trial entry for all patients to allocate induction treatment separately for those considered eligible or ineligible for transplantation; after induction treatment for those patients with a suboptimal response to treatment (minimal or partial response) to allocate induction intensification; and at the completion of induction and intensification or autologous stem-cell transplantation (where applicable) to allocate maintenance treatment.

The trial was done at 110 National Health Service hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland (
