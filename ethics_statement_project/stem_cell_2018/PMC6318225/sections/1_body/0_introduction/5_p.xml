<p id="para110">Three previous studies have shown that lenalidomide maintenance can delay disease progression after autologous stem-cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma.

 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> showed no significant benefit. However, a recently published meta-analysis

 </xref> including these trials showed that lenalidomide maintenance can improve overall survival compared with observation in this setting, and it is now approved for use by both the European Medicines Agency and US Food and Drug Administration. For patients with multiple myeloma who are ineligible for transplantation, continuous therapy with lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone improved progression-free survival and overall survival compared with a combination of melphalan, prednisone, and thalidomide.
