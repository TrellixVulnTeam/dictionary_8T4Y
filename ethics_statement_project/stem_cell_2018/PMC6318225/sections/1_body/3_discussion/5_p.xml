<p id="para550">Our study has limitations. Although the Myeloma XI had a much larger sample size than that of previous studies, our subgroup analyses were not powered and therefore are not conclusive and warrant further investigation. Additionally, cytogenetic data were not available for all patients, further reducing the sample size, and should be interpreted with caution. However, baseline characteristics and outcomes were similar between patients with and without cytogenetic data available.</p>
