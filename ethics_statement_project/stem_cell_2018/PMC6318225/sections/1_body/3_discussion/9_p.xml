<p id="para590">For transplantation-ineligible patients with multiple myeloma, a significant improvement in progression-free survival has been reported when lenalidomide maintenance was given after a regimen of melphalan, prednisone, and lenalidomide (median progression-free survival from start of induction 31 months 
 <italic>vs</italic> 14 months); the 3-year overall survival in this study was 70% with maintenance and 62% without maintenance therapy.

 </xref> continuous treatment significantly improved progression-free survival (median 26 months 
 <italic>vs</italic> 21 months from start of induction, HR 0·70, 95% CI 0·60–0·81) but there was no difference in overall survival (median 59·1 months 
 <italic>vs</italic> 62·3 months, 1·02, 0·86–1·20). Taken together, these observations suggest that alternative approaches to improving overall survival in older patients who are not eligible for transplantation are warranted.
