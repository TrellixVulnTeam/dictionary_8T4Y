<p>Ninety-five newly diagnosed AML patients were screened for eligibility and 69 patients were enrolled onto the study between June 2011 and January 2013. Of the 26 patients ineligible for study participation, 18 were reclassified as having myelodysplastic syndrome and 8 patients chose to receive standard induction chemotherapy. Baseline characteristics are presented in 
 <xref rid="t1-1031308" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The baseline mutational profile of the cohort is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-1031308">Figure 2</xref>. The most frequently observed mutations were in 
 <italic>RUNX1</italic> (38%), 
 <italic>TET2</italic> (31%), 
 <italic>ASXL1</italic> (30%), 
 <italic>SRSF2</italic> (30%), 
 <italic>DNMT3A</italic> (28%), 
 <italic>BCOR</italic> (18%), and 
 <italic>TP53</italic> (18%). The median age at diagnosis was 73 years (range 56–87 years); 55% were male. Approximately 80% of the patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0–1 and the remainder had ECOG PS 2. Forty-four percent of patients had adverse cytogenetics, 44% had an antecedent hematologic disorder, and 45% had therapy-related AML. The median bone marrow blasts was 54% (range 6–99%) and 15% of patients had a baseline white blood cell count greater than 30×10
 <sup>9</sup>/L. Forty-five percent of patients had impaired hepatic or renal function at study entry. Twenty percent of patients had received prior treatment with azacitidine.
