<p>Of 69 evaluable patients, the overall response rate was 43% (35% CR, 7% CRi, 1% PR), with a median time to best response of 1.9 months (2 cycles, range 0.9–7.9 months). The median response duration was 4.5 months, with a median follow-up time for the entire study group (based on survivors) of 9.9 months (range 5.4–24.8 months). Median OS was 11.2 months (95%CI: 8.5 months, 13.9 months) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-1031308">Figure 3A</xref>). As expected, the median OS for responders was significantly longer (18 months; 95%CI: 10.5–25.4 months) than for non-responders (5.0 months; 95%CI: 1.4–8.6 months) (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001). Prior treatment with azacitidine was the strongest independent predictor of OS (adjusted hazard ratio 3.1, 95%CI: 1.3–7.3; 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.008) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-1031308">Figure 3B</xref>). The median survival of patients previously treated with azacitidine was also much shorter than for previously untreated patients (2.5 months, 95%CI: 1.1–3.8 months 
 <italic>vs</italic>. 12.6 months, 95%CI: 9.5–15.7 months; 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.001). In addition, whereas 52% of HMA treatment-naïve patients responded to treatment (46%/6% CR/CRi), only 14% of patients previously treated with an HMA achieved a response (0%/14% CR/CRi; 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.002). Finally, adverse karyotype did not predict overall response (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.31) and 53% of patients with adverse cytogenetics achieved responses (43% CR, 7% CRi, 3% PR). Median OS was 10.9 months in 59 patients without a TP53 mutation and 18.1 months in the 10 patients with TP53 mutation, but this result was not statistically significant, probably due to the small sample size. In multivariate analysis, however, adverse karyotype, as well as baseline bone marrow blasts more than 54%, were significant predictors of poor OS. Neither therapy-related AML nor the presence of an antecedent hematologic disorder was a significant predictor of response; 10 patients with therapy-related AML (32%) and 14 patients (45%) with an antecedent hematologic disorder achieved CR/CRi. There were no significant differences in ORR or OS based on plerixafor dose level (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.55 and 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.19, respectively) or treatment schedule (A 
 <italic>vs</italic>. B; 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.71 and 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.53, respectively), but the study was not powered for these comparisons.
