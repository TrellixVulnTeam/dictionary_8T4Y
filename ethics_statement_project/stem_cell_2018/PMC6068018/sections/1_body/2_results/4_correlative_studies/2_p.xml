<p>Phenotypically defined LSCs were evaluated in the bone marrow during treatment. It is clear that LSCs were shown to persist even after multiple cycles of decitabine (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-1031308">Figure 6B</xref>), suggesting the inability of decitabine to eliminate these cells. Furthermore, among responders, the absence of an increased population of LSCs after cycle 3 correlated with prolonged remission, with relapse in most patients only after 8 cycles of therapy. In contrast, all patients with a greater than two-fold increase in LSCs at cycle 3 relative to the previous bone marrow time point replapsed before completing 7 cycles of therapy (
