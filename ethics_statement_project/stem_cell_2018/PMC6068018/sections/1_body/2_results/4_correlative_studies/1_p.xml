<p>The primary goal of the correlative studies was to assess the ability of plerixafor to induce mobilization. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-1031308">Figure 4</xref>, treatment with plerixafor resulted in significant mobilization of leukemic stem and progenitor cells, but not as robustly and consistently as predicted. The mobilizing effect of plerixafor was highly significant (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.0221) among clinical responders (n=21) 
 <italic>versus</italic> non-responders (n=19) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-1031308">Figure 4B</xref>). Patients who received plerixafor combined with decitabine starting in their first cycle of treatment (B cohorts) were observed to have their most significant mobilizations during plerixafor-containing cycles (n=26; 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.0318) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-1031308">Figure 4C and D</xref>). As plerixafor is a CXCR4 antagonist that is expected to induce cell cycle entry of LSCs 
 <italic>via</italic> loss of CXCR4-SDF1 interaction, we evaluated CXCR4 expression prior to plerixafor (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-1031308">Figure 5A</xref>), as well as cell cycle status before and after exposure to plerixafor (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-1031308">Figure 5C</xref>). As expected, we found that, within the responder group, plerixafor was more likely to mobilize CXCR4
 <sup>+</sup> cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-1031308">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Interestingly, no significant differences were found for the non-responder group when evaluating mobilization with respect to CXCR4 expression (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S1A</italic>). In addition, we found that plerixafor was more likely to increase the cycling of stem/progenitor cells, as measured by Ki-67 staining (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-1031308">Figure 5C and D</xref>). However, even though we observed that mobilizers tended to have increased proportions of cycling cells, we did not find differences in the duration of response or time to relapse between patients with and without increased cycling (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S1B</italic>).
