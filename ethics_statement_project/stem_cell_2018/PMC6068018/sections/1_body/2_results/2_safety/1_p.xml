<p>Grade 3 and 4 adverse events were as expected for older AML patients and included myelosupression in all patients, febrile neutropenia (65%), bacteremia (30%), and respiratory infections (23%). While myelosuppression was common, there were no episodes of unexpectedly prolonged myelosuppression in the absence of residual AML. Grade 1 and 2 adverse events observed in more than 20% of patients included, in ascending order of frequency: depression (23%), anxiety (26%), limb-related pain (29%), anorexia (30%), fever (30%), peripheral edema (33%), infection (36%), elevated creatinine (46%), nausea (48%), fatigue (51%), constipation (52%), skin disorders (53%), diarrhea (58%), and elevated bilirubin (83%) (

There was no clinically significant hyperleukocytosis caused by plerixafor. There was one episode of dose-limiting toxicity, renal insufficiency, in the 810 μg/kg cohort, but this was not clearly related to plerixafor. Still, this event, combined with the clinical impression of increased insomnia and increased non-serious gastrointestinal complaints in the 810 μg/kg cohort, led us to recommend 675 μg/kg as the maximum tolerated dose of plerixafor for this regimen. The 30-day induction mortality was 5.8% (n=4) and 60-day induction mortality was 13.0% (n=9).
