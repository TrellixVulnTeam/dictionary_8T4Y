<p>The overall response rate of 43% and overall survival of 11 months are consistent with, but not significantly better, than the results from single-agent, 10-day schedules of decitabine reported by our center and others. Responses were seen in poor-prognosis, older patients with AML, including in those with particularly aggressive biological features, such as adverse karyotype, TP53 mutation, or therapy-related disease. Of interest, as has been previously reported with decitabine,

 </sup> OS was longer in patients with TP53 mutations, though the small sample size precluded statistical significance. While our data did not confirm a robust clinical benefit for the addition of plerixafor to decitabine in the doses and schedules investigated, the strong scientific rationale for the combination, the sugges tive correlative scientific data, and the safety and feasibility of the approach argue that the concept of CXCR4 blockade in AML therapy should not be abandoned. Strategies for further investigation could include mobilization with alternative CXCR4 antagonists, such as novel small molecule inhibitors and antibodies, as well as combination strategies with G-CSF, E-selectin antagonists, and/or BCL2-inhibitors.
