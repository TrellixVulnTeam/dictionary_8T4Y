<p>This investigator-initiated clinical trial was the first time a mobilizing agent has been combined with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor in newly diagnosed patients with AML. The study was based on the hypothesis that blockade of CXCR4/SDF-1 signaling with plerixafor would mobilize leukemic stem and progenitor cells out of their bone marrow microenvironment and make them more susceptible to the effects of decitabine. We found that adding plerixafor to decitabine was safe and tolerable. The toxicity profile was as expected for older patients with newly diagnosed AML treated with 10-day cycles of decitabine and included myelosuppression, febrile neutropenia, and infections. Importantly, the addition of plerixafor did not induce clinically significant hyperleukocytosis or tumor lysis syndrome. Grade 1 and 2 insomnia and gastrointestinal disturbances were more frequent with plerixafor, but there were no major, unexpected events. We established the maximum tolerated dose of plerixafor as 810 μg/kg and the recommended treatment dose for combination with decitabine as 675 μg/kg, based on an event of renal insufficiency, combined with increased episodes of gastrointestinal complaints and insomnia.</p>
