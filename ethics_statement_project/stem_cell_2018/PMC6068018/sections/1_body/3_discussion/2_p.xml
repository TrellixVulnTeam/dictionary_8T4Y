<p>We designed extensive correlative scientific studies in an effort to understand the effects of plerixafor on leukemic stem and progenitor populations. Treatment with plerixafor resulted in significant mobilization of leukemic stem and progenitor cells, but not as effectively as predicted. There are several possible reasons for this, including: a) suboptimal dose and/or schedule of plerixafor, leading to inadequate CXCR4 blockade; b) suboptimal CXCR4 blockade despite adequate dosing; c) adequate CXCR4 blockade, but presence of additional factors influencing the dependency of LSCs on their microenvironment, such as VLA-4 and/or E-selectin. Also, CXCR4-expressing LSCs were more effectively mobilized than those without CXCR4 expression and plerixafor effectively increased the cycling of stem/progenitor cells, but we did not measure the effect of increased cycling on the ability of decitabine to incorporate into these cells. Our data show that leukemia stem and progenitor cells persist after treatment with decitabine. Persistence of LSCs has been associated with disease progression in larger AML studies using chemotherapy,

 </sup> but the significance of phenotypically-defined LSCs in disease progression or clinical out comes for HMA-based therapies requires further investigation in larger studies. We did not observe consistent data indicating that CXCR4 blockade with plerixafor sensitizes LSCs and progenitors to decitabine, but depletion of LSC populations by cycle 3 among responders seemed to be predictive of longer remission duration.
