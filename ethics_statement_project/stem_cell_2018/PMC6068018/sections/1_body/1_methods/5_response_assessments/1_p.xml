 </sup> Complete remission (CR) was defined as a decrease in bone marrow blasts to less than 5% and absence of blasts in the peripheral blood, coupled with recovery of the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) to ≥1.0×10
 <sup>6</sup>/mL and platelet count to ≥100×10
 <sup>6</sup>/mL. Patients who met all criteria for CR except ANC or platelet recovery were defined as CR with incomplete peripheral blood count recovery (CRi). Partial response (PR) was defined as a ≥50% reduction in bone marrow blasts.
