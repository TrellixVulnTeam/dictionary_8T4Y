 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1031308">Figure 1</xref>. Ninety-three patients were screened and 69 were enrolled onto the trial. Prior to protocol treatment, patients were treated with hydroxyurea to reduce the total white blood cell count to &lt;30 ×10
 <sup>9</sup>/L. Up to 4 induction cycles of decitabine, with or without the addition of plerixafor, were permitted, with 28–56 days between the starting days of each cycle. Decitabine was administered as an intravenous infusion of 20 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> over 1 hour (h) on days 1–10 of every treatment cycle. Plerixafor was administered 4 h prior to decitabine, during alternating treatment cycles: schedule A patients received plerixafor during even-numbered cycles and schedule B patients received plerixafor during odd-numbered cycles. There were three dosing cohorts of plerixafor. Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 received 320, 540, and 810 μg/kg of plerixafor intravenously on days 1–5, respectively, during alternating treatment cycles. All patients in all groups were treated with decitabine at the same dose and schedule. Patients with evidence of clinical benefit from treatment, including improved blood counts, reduced transfusion requirements, and/or improved performance status were eligible for treatment with ongoing monthly maintenance cycles of five days of decitabine, with plerixafor administered during alternate cycles according to the same dose and schedule as during induction. Patients were treated with antibiotics, transfusions, and other supportive care measures as per institutional guidelines. The use of erythropoietic growth factors was not permitted. GSCF was permitted at the discretion of the investigator, but could not be administered on the same days as plerixafor. Plerixafor was provided by Genzyme Inc., which was later acquired by Sanofi Oncology.
