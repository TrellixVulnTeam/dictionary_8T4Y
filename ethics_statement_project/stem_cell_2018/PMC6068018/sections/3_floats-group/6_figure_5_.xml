  <p>Plerixafor is more likely to mobilize CXCR4
   <sup>+</sup> cells and increase the cycling of stem/progenitor cells. (A) Representative flow cytometry histograms for CXCR4 expression in diagnostic samples from a mobilizer and a non-mobilizer. Blue filled histogram represents control, red represents CXCR4-stained. (B) Scatter plots for the expression of CXCR4 at diagnosis comparing mobilizers and non-mobilizers within the responder group. (C) Representative flow cytometry dot plots to determine cell cycle status. Red squares show quiescent cells. (D) Scatter plots representing Ki-67
   <sup>+</sup> stem/progenitor cells in mobilizers and non-mobilizers during plerixafor-containing cycles (PD) and non-plerixafor cycles (D). Each symbol represents a patient, horizontal bar represents the mean, error bars represent the Standard Error of Mean.
