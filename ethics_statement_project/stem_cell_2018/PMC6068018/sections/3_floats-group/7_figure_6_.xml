  <p>Leukemia stem/progenitor cells persist after treatment with decitabine; absence of increase in leukemia stem cells (LSCs) at cycle 3 in responders correlates with longer remissions. (A) Scatter plots representing the fold change in LSCs (CD34
   <sup>+</sup>CD38
   <sup>−</sup>CD123
   <sup>+</sup>CD90
   <sup>−</sup>) in the bone marrow at the end of the cycle indicated, relative to the previous time point. (B) Fold change in LSCs in the bone marrow for a subset of responders from cohorts 3A and 3B comparing mobilizers and non-mobilizers. (C) Fold change in LSCs in the bone marrow at cycle 3 comparing patients who relapsed before cycle 7 (C &lt;7) to those who relapsed after cycle 8 (C &gt;8); patients who were transplanted or off trial are shown. Each symbol represents a patient, horizontal bar represents the mean, error bars represent the Standard Error of Mean.
