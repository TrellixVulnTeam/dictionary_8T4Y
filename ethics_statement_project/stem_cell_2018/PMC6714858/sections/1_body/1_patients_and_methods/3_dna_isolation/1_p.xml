<p>The EZ-10 Spin Column Genomic genomic DNA Minipreps isolation kits (Biobasic Inc, Markham, Ontario, Canada) were used to extract genomic DNA from blood samples. Overall, blood samples (0.4-5 mL) were drawn from 102 participants. For DNA extraction, 500 µL of complete blood sample was placed in the centrifugation tubes (2 mL) with addition of 800 µL tris borate phosphate buffer, which was then vortexed and kept for 1 minute at room temperature (The mixture should be bright red and red blood cells should be resolved). The mixture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 3 minutes, and the supernatant was removed. If the supernatant and blood pellet was still red, the second step and subsequent steps were repeated. Then, 500 µL Tris-borate magnesium buffer was added to tube, which was vortexed briefly. Again, 3 µL proteinase K was added to the tube, which was kept at 55°C for 30 minutes for incubation. If there was any unsolved material, the tube was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 2 minutes. The supernatant was transferred to another tube (2 mL), and 260 µL absolute ethanol was added, which was then transferred to column and centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 2 minutes. After adding 500 µL wash solution, the column was recentrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 1 minute. The collection tube was poured, and 500 µL wash solution was added for further centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 1 minute. Then, to remove residual wash solution, tube was recentrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 1 minute. Spin was continued until purification was achieved. The column (1.5 mL) was placed to an Eppendorf tube, and 50 µL elution buffer was applied to center of column. After incubation at 37°C for 2 minutes, the tube was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 1 minute to extract DNA. The purified DNA was stored at −20°C until PCR analysis.</p>
