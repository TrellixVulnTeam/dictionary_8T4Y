<p>The isolated DNA was used for PCR analysis. In each PCR tube, 22 µL of the mixture was placed and 3 µL DNA was added to this mixture, resulting in 25 µL of final volume. The samples were placed in the PCR device. Samples obtained from PCR device were run at 2% agarose gel at 90 V for 2 hours. Then, the PCR bands were imaged using Molecular Imager Gel Doc XR System device (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California). The PCR products with 290 base pair (bp) were assigned for PCR RFLP protocol. The PCR products were stored at 4°C until RFLP analysis.</p>
