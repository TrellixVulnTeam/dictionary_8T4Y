<p>This study included 51 patients diagnosed with VKDB at Pediatric Neurology and Pediatric Hematology departments of Erciyes University Medicine School between 1990 and 2016 and 51 volunteers with normal platelet count. Patients with congenital malformation, chromosome anomaly, cholestatic liver disease, congenital valve defects, prenatal diagnosis, and periventricular leukomalacia were excluded. Neurological sequels and coagulation disorders were taken into account while selecting control group. The data regarding birth parameters such as clinical age, gender, form of feeding, and treatment were tabulated by reviewing medical charts. Psychomotor and neurological assessments were performed. In both patient and control groups, blood samples (4 mL) were drawn into EDTA tubes in order to study 
 <italic>VKOR1-1639G&gt;A</italic> polymorphism and stored at −80°C until DNA isolation. The DNA isolation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) preparation, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) procedures were performed at Genome Unite of Genome and Stem Cell Center of Erciyes University.
