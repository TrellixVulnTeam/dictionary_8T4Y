<p>HpaII restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Massachusetts) was used for 
 <italic>VKORC1-1639G&gt;A</italic> polymorphism. RFLP was performed as follows. The PCR product (15 µL) was delivered to tubes according to patient number and then other substrates (10× Buffer Tango [33 mmol/L Tris-acetate, pH 7.9, 10 mmol/L magnesium acetate, 66 mmol/L potassium acetate, 0.1 mg/mL BSA], Hpa II restriction enzyme and water) were added at appropriate volumes. The mixture was incubated overnight at 37°C. The incubated samples were run on 3% agarose gel at 85 V for 2 hours. The PCR products and restriction enzymes were assessed by Molecular Imager Gel Doc XR System device. The products with 168 bp and 122 bp were considered as homozygous normal, while those with 290 to 168 bp and 122 bp were considered as heterozygous normal. The PCR products with 290 bp were considered as homozygous mutant.
