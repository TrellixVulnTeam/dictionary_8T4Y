 </sup> reported that there were neurological findings in 21% to 73% of patients with mortality rate of 19% to 57%. In the literature, in a study by McNinch et al,

 </sup> it was reported that 2 of 10 patients without vitamin K prophylaxis who received solely breast-feeding died in United Kingdom in 1991. When compared to the 1639 G-A distribution in the normal Turkish population. In our control group, we found the VKORC genotype as 19 (37.3%) for GG, 19 (37.3%) for GA, and 13 (25.5%) for AA alleles. Silan et al
