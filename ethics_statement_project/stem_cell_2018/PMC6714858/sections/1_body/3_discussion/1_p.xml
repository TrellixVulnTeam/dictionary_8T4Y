<p>There was significant difference in 
 <italic>VKOR1-1639G&gt;A</italic> polymorphism between patient and control groups. 
 <italic>VKOR1-1639G&gt;A</italic> mutant positivity was higher in the patient group when compared to controls. The rates of neurological sequels, epilepsy, and need for ICU care at neonatal period were higher than anticipated. No significant difference was found in the prognosis between mutant (heterozygous plus homozygous mutants) and normal group (no polymorphism).
