<p>In conclusion, it has proven that VKDB is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality in previous studies. It was reported that survivors of intracranial bleeding secondary to VKBD displayed severe psychomotor retardation, cerebral palsy, hydrocephaly, microcephaly, and convulsions. Given the burden of VKDB which is a preventable disease with poor prognosis, it is apparent that etiology, prognosis, and outcomes should have to be established in our country. In this study, we attempted to demonstrate VKDB and its prognosis in our country. We think that an additional dose of vitamin K in first months of life will considerably decrease intracranial bleeding secondary to VKDB in infants receiving breast-feeding solely.
