<p>In recent years, after discovery of 
 <italic>VKOR1-1639G&gt;A</italic> involved in VKE gene system, several studies have been conducted about this gene. Most of these studies focused on investigation of anticoagulant activity in human. In the study by Nowak-Gottle et al,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="bibr14-1076029618792302" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
 </sup> it was shown that VKORC polymorphism accounts for dose variation in vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants. In the study by Schreiner et al,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="bibr15-1076029618792302" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
 </sup> it was shown that infants with VKORC 1639A allele are at high risk of intraventricular hemorrhage. In a rat study by Spohn et al,

 </sup> VKORC homozygous rats which were healthy at birth died mainly due to intracerebral hemorrhage 2 to 20 days after birth. In our study, VKOR/1639G&gt;A polymorphism was found to be significantly higher in the patient group than controls, and there was significant relationship between 
 <italic>VKOR1-1639G&gt;A</italic> and VKDB.
