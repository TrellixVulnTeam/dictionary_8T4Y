<p>Time of presentation, presenting complaint, platelet count and PT, and aPTT values were extracted from medical records. We failed to access imaging studies in all patients, since hospital database was replaced with a newer version. Time at first presentation to hospital was available in 25 patients. It was found that 13 patients presented to hospital at 15 to 30 days of life, while remaining 12 patients presented beyond first month of life. The patients were screened for presence of underlying etiology. No known reason was found in these patients. Presenting complaint was irritability and difficulty in feeding in 10, convulsion in 9, fontanel bulging in 2, fadedness in 2, and jaundice in 1 patient.</p>
