<p>When genetic mutations were assessed, it was found that 8 (15.7%) patients had no mutation, while 29 (56.9%) patients were heterozygous carrier and 14 (27.5%) patients were homozygous mutant in the patient group. It was found that 19 (37.3%) patients were normal, while 19 (37.3%) patients were heterozygous carrier and 13 (25.5%) patients were homozygous mutant in the control group (
 <xref rid="table1-1076029618792302" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These findings indicate significant differences between patient and control groups. The 
 <italic>VKOR1-1639&gt;A</italic> mutant positivity (homozygous plus heterozygous mutant) was significantly higher in the patient group compared to controls (
 <italic>P</italic> = .037). There was significant difference between patient and control groups regarding no mutation and heterozygous mutation (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) but not homozygous mutation (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05).
