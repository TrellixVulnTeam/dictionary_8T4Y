<p>Vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) is one of the most common hemostatic disorders at neonatal period and leading preventable cause of mental retardation, epilepsy, and cerebral palsy.

 </sup> There are 3 types of VKDB. Early-onset VKDB is seen on the first day of life and associated with maternal use of drugs that disrupt vitamin K metabolism, while classical type results from insufficient vitamin K production that occurs between days 2 and 7 of life and has poor prognosis. Late-onset VKDB occurs due to insufficient vitamin K intake between 2 and 8 weeks of age.

 </sup> The late-onset VKDB in newborns is characterized by intracranial bleeding that may occur between week 1 and month 6.

 </sup> Vitamin K is a cofactor for gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX) that is involved in formation of tertiary structure and posttranslational modification of coagulation factors and some proteins. The reduced form of vitamin K (hydroquinone) is converted to vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) and vitamin K epoxide (VKE), while glutamate (glu-) residues are converted to Î³-carboxyglutamate in carboxylation process during hepatic synthesis of factors II, VII, IX, X and proteins S, C, and Z. To maintain this cycle, hydroquinone should be regenerated from VKE, which is controlled by an enzyme called vitamin K 2, 3 epoxide reductase complex (VKORC).
