<p>Bleeding predisposition develops due to inability to activate coagulation factors in case of vitamin K deficiency or VKOR polymorphism. γ-GK gene encoding VKOR was isolated on chromosome 16 in 2014.

 </sup> Currently, it is known that single-nucleotide polymorphism 1639G&gt;A at promoter region of VKOR gene causes up to 50% decrease in VKOR enzyme.

 </sup> This is implied in the variation in doses of warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist.

 </sup> Carboxylation is essential for normal activity of coagulation system. γ-carboxylation occurs in endoplasmic reticulum, and it is thought that carboxylation is catalyzed by GGCX. The carboxylated proteins are transferred to Golgi apparatus where they are secreted.
