 </sup> Gamma-glutamyl carboxylase and VKORC are involved in posttranslational modifications of proteins. In our study, it was aimed to investigate the molecular etiology in patients with late-onset VKDB who were followed in Pediatric Neurology and Pediatric Hematology departments of Erciyes University Medicine School and to identify 
 <italic>VKOR1-1639G&gt;A</italic> polymorphism encoding VKORC that is thought to cause VKDB in Turkish population.
