<p id="Par41">In addition, the incorporation of CD28 and TLR2 costimulatory domains in this study was different from the other third-generation CARs, which incorporate two costimulatory domains such as CD28 and 4-1BB or OX-40. These additional costimulatory signals could improve the expansion of CAR T cells. Most third-generation CAR T cells would improve cytokine secretion due to the productive T cell-stimulation and probably induce the severe CRS in patients. At present, most available CAR T cells usage in clinical were the second-generation ones and no direct comparison between these third generation CARs was reported. In this study, it was of note that the 1928zT2 T cells infusion just induced grade 2 or 3 CRS and these patients recovered spontaneously or after treatment with tocilizumab. Although we observed an onset of several cytokines elevations in parallel with robust T cell expansion in these patients, which was consistent with previous studies suggesting some degree of CRS is probably necessary for CAR T cells efficacy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], the rest 34 tested cytokines did not fluctuate, indicating that the limited cytokine secretion was possibly related with the low toxicity of 1928zT2 T cells.
