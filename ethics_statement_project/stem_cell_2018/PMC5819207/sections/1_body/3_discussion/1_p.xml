 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although chemotherapy, radiation, surgical resection, and allo-HSCT are all modalities that can be incorporated into the therapy of EM-ALL, the optimal treatment remains unclear and these regimens would induce substantial short-term and long-term toxicities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Until recently, there has been no define therapy for these patients who probably have poor outcomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We report three extramedullary relapse/refractory B-ALL patients achieved a complete remission by 1928zT2 T cells infusion, which implied the CAR T cells possess a potentially efficacy on EM-ALL relapsed or refractory. The three patients in this study had multiple relapses even though they had received chemotherapy, allo-HSCT, and/or radiation prior to CAR T cells infusion. Our results raise the prospect that 1928zT2 T cells infusion is able to rapidly eradicate extramedullary leukemia without any uncontrolled toxicities.
