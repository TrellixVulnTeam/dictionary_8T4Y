<p id="Par40">1928zT2 T cells infusion may overcome many limitations of conventional therapies. For instance, CNS is regarded as a pharmacological sanctuary for leukemia cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, 1928zT2 T cells could traffic to the CNS and eradicate leukemia here without any overt CNS toxicities. Although some studies reported that CAR T cells emerging in CSF are associated with development of neurotoxicity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], we did not find any evidence of neurotoxicity in patient 3. It was reported that the Phase II ROCKET trial of JCAR015 (19-28z CAR T cells) was halted for ALL due to the development of sever cerebral edema and subsequent death of several patients, which was associated with rapid expansion and exhaustion of CAR T-cells with CD28. Until now, there was no direct evidence of possible causal relationships of CD28 incorporation and neurotoxicity of CAR T-cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. It is speculated that CAR T cells incorporating 4-1BB are more persistent and less likely to undergo exhaustion than those incorporating CD28, contributing to improved tolerability [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, from the primary data of nine patients using 1928zT2 T cells with CD28 in our phase I clinical trial, no patients suffered from cerebral edema during the follow-up. Overall, the well tolerance and efficacy of 1928zT2 T cells in this study provides a promise for CNS-3 status leukemia patients, who were ineligible for CAR T cells before, though more patients are needed to be recruited in the clinical trial.
