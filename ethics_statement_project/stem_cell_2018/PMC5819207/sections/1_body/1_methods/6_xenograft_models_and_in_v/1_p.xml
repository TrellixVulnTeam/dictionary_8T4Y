<p id="Par26">To develop the mouse subcutaneous tumor xenograft model of human extramedullary ALL leukemia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], NSI mice of ages 6 to 10 weeks were used. All procedures were performed under approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Ethics Committee. NALM6-GL (2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells in 200 μl PBS) was injected subcutaneously, and 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> lentiviral transduced human T cells in 200 μl PBS were adoptively transferred to these mice systemically by tail vein injection 2 days later. In vivo whole body imaging of luciferase-labeled cells was performed by cooled CCD camera system (IVIS 100 Series Imaging System, Xenogen, Alameda, CA). D-Luciferin firefly, potassium salt (75 mg/kg) was injected, and the mice were imaged. Quantification of total and average emissions was performed using the Living Image software (Xenogen). The mice were killed at day 34, and their subcutaneous tumor masses were extracted and weighted.
