<p id="Par23">The 1928zT2 T cells were generated as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Briefly, the 19-28z-TLR2 lentiviral vector was established with 19-28z-TLR2, a CAR-linking FMC63-scFv, CD28 transmembrane and endodomain, the CD3ζ signaling domain, and the TIR domain (amino acid 639-784) of TLR2. Primary human T lymphocytes were isolated and collected, then stimulated with magnetic beads coated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies (Miltenyi Biotec) at cell to bead ratio of 1 to 2. Approximately 72 h after activation, T cells were transfected with 19-28z-TLR2 lentiviral vector. These T cells were fed every 2 days with fresh media and used within 14 days of expansion.
