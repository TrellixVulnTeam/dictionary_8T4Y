<p id="Par28">mRNA was extracted from cells with Trizol (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using the PrimeScript™ RT reagent Kit (Takara). All reactions were performed with TransStart Tip Green qPCR SuperMix (Transgene) on a Bio-Rad CFX96 real-time PCR machine. Delta CT calculations were relative to β-actin and were corrected for PCR efficiencies.</p>
