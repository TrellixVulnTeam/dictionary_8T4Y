<p id="Par22">Patients underwent an apheresis to obtain sufficient PBMCs for producing 1928zT2 T cells. The manufacture of 1928zT2 was completed in about 14 days. The cells were released for infusion after safety check. All patients received a lymphodepletion conditioning regimen which contained with fludarabine 25 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup>, cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup>, and/or plus other drugs. After 1-day rest, they received a split-dose infusion of 1928zT2 T cells (a total of 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>–1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/kg and 10% on day 1, 30% on day 2, and 60% on day 3). No post-infusion cytokines such as IL-2 were administered. These patients were evaluated for responses and toxic effects. The expansion and persistence of circulating 1928zT2 T cells were also monitored. Adverse events such as CRS after 1928zT2 T cell infusion were graded according to National Institutes of Health criteria (Common terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and clinical responses were evaluated and defined as complete remission (CR), CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD) according with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. MRD negative was defined as the absence of leukemia cells in BM determined by flow cytometry, and the absence of fusion gene in BM determined by qPCR.
