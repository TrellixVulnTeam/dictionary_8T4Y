<p id="Par19">Patient 1 was a 34-year-old female diagnosed as B-ALL (CD19+, BCR/ABL-) in April, 2015 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Although she had no response to chemotherapy regimen of VDLCP at first, the patient achieved CR after Hyper CVAD A therapy. She received four cycles of chemotherapy and underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) from her 10/10 HLA allele-matched sister in November, 2015. However, 9 months later, she had a relapse in extramedullary tissues including her left breast and multiple lymph nodes identified by Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The extramedullary leukemia in breast was confirmed histologically (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), and leukemia blast cells were detected as positive for TdT, CD19, CD20, CD79a, CD34, CD99, CD10, PAX5, and Ki67 (15%), and negative for CD3 and Cyclin D1. B-mode ultrasound was used to monitor the tumor mass in the left breast, and about 2.8 × 1.6 cm size of an inhomogeneous hypo-echoic mass was identified (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). No evidence of relapse in BM and CNS was observed with persisted complete donor chimerism or negative minimal residual disease.
