<p id="Par25">The target cells K562, K562-CD19, and NALM6 were tagged both GFP and luciferase (GL), specifically incubated with GFP T, 1928z T or 1928zT2 T cells at the indicated ratios in triplicate wells in U-bottomed 96-well plates. Viability of target cells was monitored 18 h later by adding 100 dl/well substrate D-luciferin firefly (Life Sciences) resolved at 150 μg/ml. Background luminescence was negligible (&lt; 1% than the signal from the wells with only target cells). The viability percentage was calculated as experimental signal/maximal signal × 100%, and killing percentage was equal to 100 − viability percentage.</p>
