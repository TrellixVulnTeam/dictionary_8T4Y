<p id="Par14">Despite great advances, relapsed and refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) shows unfavorable prognosis, especially for adult patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although newly diagnosed ALL patients co-occurring with extramedullary involvement are rare, ALL with extramedullary tissues (EM-ALL) occurs in about 15 to 20% of all the relapse patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The central nervous system (CNS) is a favorable site for ALL relapse, accounting for two thirds of extramedullary relapse [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Besides, the extramedullary leukemia appears in the skin, breasts, bones, muscle, abdominal organs, and eyes. The presence of extramedullary leukemia is often associated with significantly shorter progression-free survival and overall survival [
