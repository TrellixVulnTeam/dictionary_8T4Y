<p id="Par16">Recently, we generated 1928zT2 T cells targeting CD19 by introducing the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) to 1928z [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The activation of TLR2, a canonical costimulatory receptor, promotes the regression of established leukemia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, incorporation with TLR2 domain improves expansion of CAR-T cells and potentiates the killing capacity of CAR T cells against CD19
 <sup>+</sup> leukemic cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Actually, the leukemia cells with potent abilities for cell migration, proliferation, adhesion, and protease activity facilitated themselves extramedullary infiltration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In this context, it is highly warranted to find tumor-specific T cells with enhanced activity against the leukemic cells of high affinity for the extramedullary relapse. The advent of novel 1928zT2 T cells with improved expansion and enhanced anti-tumor function causes it hopeful to treat such a complicated and aggressive disorder.
