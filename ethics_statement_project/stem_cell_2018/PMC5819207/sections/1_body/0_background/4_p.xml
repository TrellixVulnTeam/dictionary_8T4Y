<p id="Par17">In this study, we report the remarkable ability of 1928zT2 T cells to induce complete remission (CR) in extramedullary tissues of three ALL patients, who had a relapse with resistant to available therapies. Our results provide evidences of extensive usage of CAR T cells in these adults, who have aggressive and often fatal relapsed ALL with extramedullary involvement.</p>
