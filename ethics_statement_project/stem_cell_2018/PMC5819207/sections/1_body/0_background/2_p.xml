<p id="Par15">Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are emerging as a powerful therapy for relapse or refractory ALL [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; however, the conventional CAR-T cells had shown little evidence of antitumor activity against extramedullary leukemia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Moreover, the efficacy of CAR T cells against solid tumors is substantially poorer than that against leukemia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], impelling us to improve the design of CAR T vectors. The leukemia infiltrated into extramedullary tissues is often associated with poor response to therapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. To our knowledge, most previous clinical trials of CAR T cells treatment did not enroll the patients with extramedullary leukemia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].
