<p id="Par34">In patient 3, the visible tumor mass below xiphoid receded gradually beginning on day 3 and disappeared identified by B-mode ultrasound on day 18, indicating the 1928zT2 T cells started to eradicate B-ALL cells rapidly (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Two months later, restaging PET-CT also showed complete remission in all extramedullary lesions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). The patient markedly achieved complete clearance of blasts in CSF and relief of symptoms on day 18 post 1928zT2 T cell infusion (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>) and obtained recovery of thrombocytopenia and was entitled to receive the lumbar puncture. No CD19
 <sup>+</sup>CD10
 <sup>+</sup> blasts were detected in CSF (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>), and X/Y FISH showed that the remaining recipient cells in CSF were 100%XX from the donor (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g</xref>), suggesting a complete replacement by donor cells and remission in CSF. Collectively, 1928zT2 T cells exhibited potent anti-leukemia effects in these three ALL patients with extramedullary involvement.
