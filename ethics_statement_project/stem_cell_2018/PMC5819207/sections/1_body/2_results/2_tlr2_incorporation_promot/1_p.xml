<p id="Par31">To further address the potential therapeutic application of 1928zT2 T cells in extramedullary leukemia, we next examined whether these cells harbored cytolytic activity against subcutaneous leukemia ex vivo
 <italic>.</italic> The cell line-derived xenografts were established in the immunodeficient NSI mice by subcutaneous injection of 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> NALM-6 cells that were tagged with GFP and luciferase. Two days later, these xenografts mice were administrated with one intravenous infusion of 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> GFP T, 1928z T cells or 1928zT2 T cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The BLI results revealed that tumors were significantly suppressed in mice treated with 1928zT2 T cells compared with those received GFP T cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), highlighting the potent efficacy of these novel 1928zT2 T cells against extramedullary leukemia. Conversely, there was no significant difference of tumor burden between 1928z T cells and GFP T cells. The tumors from mice that were treated with 1928zT2 T cells were smaller than that from control groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Collectively, 1928zT2 T cells significantly reduced tumor burden in subcutaneous leukemia-bearing xenografts.
