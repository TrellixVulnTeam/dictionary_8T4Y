<p id="Par36">The 1928zT2 T cells infusion was generally well tolerated in all these three patients. No immediate adverse side effects, episodes of tumor lysis syndrome, autoimmune disorder, and Graft-versus-host disease were observed. However, the patient 1 experienced grade 2 CRS on day 7 post infusion, with fever and left breast pain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6g</xref>). Her clinical presentation was resolved spontaneously on day 13. The level of IL-6, the main contributor of the CRS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], increased to a peak on day 11 and decreased sharply on day 12, before the CRS remised (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6g</xref>). We also found the level of C reactive protein (CRP), a common inflammation marker [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], followed a similar pattern of IL-6 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6g</xref>). She experienced a transient neutropenia on day 14 and day 15, and no other changes in hemogram were observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). Patient 2 also experienced CRS with grade 2 between day 9 and day 12, when the levels of IL-6, CRP, and PCT were significantly increased (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6h</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). The patient suffered fever and bone pain. This significant but transient toxicity resolved spontaneously. Patient 3 was diagnosed with grade 3 CRS. He started to have a persistent fever on day 7 and emerged refractory hypotension on day 9, which was alleviated after administrating two usages of tocilizumab (4 mg/kg/d), and was resolved on day 15 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6i</xref>). The level of IL-6 reached a peak on day 9 concurrently (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6i</xref>) and then declined along with the administration of tocilizumab. The variation tendency of CRP was also accompanied. This patient had an increase in absolute neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count, and platelets from the baseline due to the lymphodepletion regime (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). These elevations were also coincident with the expansion of 1928zT2 T cells, suggesting that CAR T cells play a role in the recovery of blood picture.
