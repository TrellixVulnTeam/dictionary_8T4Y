<p id="Par37">Several cell adhesion and inflammation genes of patient 1 were also monitored by qPCR, and the increased expression pattern is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>. The patient was in a relatively stable state without any additional support. The serum cytokines of patient 3 were monitored using luminex assays, and the levels of IL-22, MCP-1, IL-6, and HGF increased prominently from day 6 to day 17 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>), coincident with the expansion of 1928zT2 T cells in the blood. The concentrations of other 34 tested cytokines including IFN-Î³, IL-2, TNF-a, and IL-10 did not change much (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>). None of these three patients presented neurotoxicity evidence.
