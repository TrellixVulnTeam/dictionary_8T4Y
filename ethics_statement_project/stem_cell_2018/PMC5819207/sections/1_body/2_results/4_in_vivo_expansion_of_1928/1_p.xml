<p id="Par35">We used the flow-cytometry analysis to detect the GFP-positive 1928zT2 T cells in PBMCs in these three patients. In patient 1, the robust 1928zT2 T cells expansion occurred around day 12 and disappeared by day 92 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). In addition, CD19+ cells were reduced and became absent within 10 days post the 1928zT2 T cells infusion (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Then, a continuous rise of IgG level was detected (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>), suggesting a slow recovery of B cells in IgG level. For patient 2, 1928zT2 T cells in circulation appeared and began to increase on day 10 after infusion and disappeared on day 50 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). Similarly, 1928zT2 T cells in BM began to expand on day 10 and retreated on day 50 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). The flow cytometry analysis results of patient 3 revealed that 1928zT2 T cells in circulation became detectable on day 6 after infusion, and continued increasing to a peak that the percentage of 1928zT2 T cells was as high as 57% in PBMC on day 12, then decreased rapidly and became undetectable after day 17 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>). Since the ALL was relapsed in CNS and extramedullary without BM involvement, MRD- statue in BM was persistently observed. In addition, the 1928zT2 T cells were identified in CSF with 1.84%, indicating the potential ability of these cells traffic to blood-brain barrier (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>). No detection of blast cells in CSF also suggested that 1928zT2 T cells exhibited robust immunosurveillance effects in CNS (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>).
