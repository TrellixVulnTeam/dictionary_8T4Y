<p id="Par30">We firstly evaluated the in vitro cytotoxic responses of 1928zT2 T cells exposed to NALM-6 cells (a CD19+ human B-ALL cell line), K562-GL cells with or without CD19 expression. As showed in the Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the 1928zT2 T cells generated from PBMC of ALL patient lysed more than 75% CD19-expressing NALM-6 cells at all indicated E:T ratios from 1:1 to 1:16, whereas less than 50% NALM-6 target cells were killed by 1928z T cells at E:T ratio of 1:16, indicating that the cytotoxicity of 1928zT2 T cells against target cells is more potent than that of 1928z T cells. Consistently, the results of killing assay with K562 cells revealed that both 1928z T and 1928zT2 T cells specifically killed the K562-CD19 cells but not the K562 cells without CD19 expression. Notably, the killing percentages of 1928zT2 T cells were higher than those of 1928z T cells at low E:T ratios. Thus, the 1928zT2 T cells exhibited enhanced anti-leukemic effect in vitro.
