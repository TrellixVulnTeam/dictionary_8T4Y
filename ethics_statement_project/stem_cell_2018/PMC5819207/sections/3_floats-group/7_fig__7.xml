  <p>The change of routine blood test and serum cytokines in these patients before and after infusion of 1928zT2 T cells. 
   <bold>a–c</bold> The circulating white blood cells count (WBC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), and platelet count (PLT) increased after treatment, indicating the recovery of routine blood test results. These blood test maintained in a relatively stable level during the follow-up in these three patients. 
   <bold>d</bold> The qPCR data revealed the expression pattern of the cell adhesion and pro-inflammatory genes in patient 2. 
   <bold>e</bold> shows the cytokine levels in the serum from patient 3 at the indicated time points after1928zT2 T cells infusion. The expressions of IL-22, MCP-1, and HGF presented as the same pattern with IL-6. The IFN-α, IL-17A, GM-CSF, IL-1β, IL-12, IL-7, and IL-15 were below the limits of detection at indicated time points and the other 34 cytokines showed little changes
