  <p>Infusion of 1928zT2 T cells induced complete remission in BM and extramedullary relapse in patient 2. 
   <bold>a</bold> The 15-year-old male was diagnosed as B-ALL in October, 2014. He had the first recurrence (RE1) in CNS, and the leukemia recurred again with BM and extramedullary involvement (RE2). After 3-day usage of F and C, he received 1928zT2 T cells infusion (5 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> cells/kg) and got CR 1 month later. Particularly, he underwent allo-HSCT again in July, 2017 and maintained remission during the follow-up. 
   <bold>b</bold> The BM smear image revealed typical leukemia blasts at baseline disappeared 1 month after 1928zT2 T cells infusion. 
   <bold>c</bold> The PET/CT revealed that an abnormal low density area and corresponding intense high metabolic region beneath the kidney capsule (red arrow). Restage of PET/CT after cells infusion presented that no low density area in the kidney, whereas there were diffuse high metabolic distribution with increased SUV due to the metabolism of 18F-FDG in the kidney
