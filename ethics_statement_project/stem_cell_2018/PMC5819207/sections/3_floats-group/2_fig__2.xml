  <p>The 1928zT2 T cells promoted the regression of subcutaneous leukemia ex vivo. 
   <bold>a</bold> The cell line-derived xenografts were established in the immunodeficient NSI mice by subcutaneous injection of 2 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> NALM-6 cells. These mice received one infusion of 2 × 10
   <sup>6</sup> GFP T, 1928z T cells, or 1928zT2 T cells, respectively. 
   <bold>b</bold> BLI results revealed a marked tumor mass grew subcutaneously in the GFP-T group and similar signal was seen in the 1928z T cells group. However, the 1928zT2 T cells group exhibited significantly reduced signal compared to the other groups, indicating that tumors were significantly suppressed in these mice. 
   <bold>c</bold> The tumor was extracted, and the specimen were showed. The tumor mass was smallest in the mice treated with 1928zT2 T cells, presenting as the lowest specific weight of tumor mass
