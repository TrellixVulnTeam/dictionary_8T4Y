  <p>The 1928zT2 T cells presented elevated killing percentage of CD19+ cells compared with 1928zT cells in vitro. The killing assay with co-cultured 1928zT2 T cells and CD19-expressing NALM6 cells revealed that the 1928zT2 T cells lysed robustly the NALM6 cells at varied indicated ratios of E:T, in particular still eradicated more than 75% NALM6 cells at low ratios, whereas the 1928zT cells presented less than 50%. Similar data were observed in the K562 cells with CD19 expression, which were also utilized to evaluate the anti-CD19+ leukemia effect of 1928zT2 T cells. The K562 cells without CD19 expression were used as negative controls and virtually no killing effect was observed in 1928zT cells and GFP-control T cells</p>
