  <p>Small dose of 1928zT2 T cell infusion eradicated leukemia and induced CR in patient 1. 
   <bold>a</bold> The diagram shows the development and therapeutic process of this ALL patient with extramedullary involvement. The 34-year-old female patient was diagnosed as B-ALL (CD19+, BCR/ABL-) in April, 2015, received allo-HSCT in November, 2015, and had a relapse in extramedullary (EM) tissues in August, 2016. She received fludarabine (F) and cytarabine (C) before cells infusion. Forty-six days after 1928zT2 T cells infusion (as low as 5 × 10
   <sup>4</sup> cells/kg), the patient achieved CR and maintained remission in the follow-up. VDLCP, vincristine, daunomycin, cyclophosphamide, asparaginase, and dexamethasone; Hyper-CVAD A, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone; SC, systemic chemotherapy; 
   <bold>b</bold> PET/CT data showed obviously an abnormal intense high metabolic mass in the left breast. Restage of PET/CT on day 30 after cells infusion presented that the lesion became hypometabolic state and no abnormal signal was observed thereafter. 
   <bold>c</bold> The histological results showed the infiltration of megakaryocytes, erythroblasts, and myeloid cells in the tumor section, proven to be extramedullary relapse. 
   <bold>d</bold> B-mode ultrasound showed an inhomogeneous hypo-echoic mass about 2.8 × 1.6 cm in diameter before cells infusion and reduction of mass size with 2.3 × 1.1 cm on day 14. The abnormal hypo-echoic mass was disappeared on day 46 and thereafter
