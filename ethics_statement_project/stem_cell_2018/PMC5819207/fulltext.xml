However, its efficacy in B-ALL patients with extramedullary involvement is limited due to poor responses and neurotoxicity. Here, we utilized a third generation of CAR T cell vector, which contains the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (ITR) domain of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), to generate 1928zT2 T cells targeting CD19, and evaluated the efficacy of 1928zT2 T cells in relapse or refractory B-ALL patients with extramedullary involvement.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">1928zT2 T cells were generated by 19-28z-TLR2 lentiviral vector transfection into primary human T lymphocytes. The anti-leukemia effect of 1928zT2 T cells were determined by killing assays and in xenografts. Three patients diagnosed as relapse or refractory ALL with extramedullary involvement were infused with 1928zT2 T cells, and the clinical responses were evaluated by BM smear, B-ultrasonography, PET/CT, histology, flow cytometry, qPCR, ELISA, and luminex assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">1928zT2 T cells exhibited enhanced effector function against CD19+ leukemic cells in vitro and in a xenograft model of human extramedullary leukemia. Notably, the 1928zT2 T cells eradicated extramedullary leukemia and induced complete remission in the three relapse and refractory ALL patients without serious adverse effects. 1928zT2 T cells expanded robustly in the circulation of these three patients and were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of patient 3. These three patients experienced cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with grade 2 or 3, which remitted spontaneously or after tocilizumab treatment.

Although newly diagnosed ALL patients co-occurring with extramedullary involvement are rare, ALL with extramedullary tissues (EM-ALL) occurs in about 15 to 20% of all the relapse patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The central nervous system (CNS) is a favorable site for ALL relapse, accounting for two thirds of extramedullary relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Besides, the extramedullary leukemia appears in the skin, breasts, bones, muscle, abdominal organs, and eyes. The presence of extramedullary leukemia is often associated with significantly shorter progression-free survival and overall survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Worse yet, there is no standard management for these patients and they have to confront dismal outcomes.</p><p id="Par15">Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are emerging as a powerful therapy for relapse or refractory ALL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; however, the conventional CAR-T cells had shown little evidence of antitumor activity against extramedullary leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Moreover, the efficacy of CAR T cells against solid tumors is substantially poorer than that against leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], impelling us to improve the design of CAR T vectors. The leukemia infiltrated into extramedullary tissues is often associated with poor response to therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. To our knowledge, most previous clinical trials of CAR T cells treatment did not enroll the patients with extramedullary leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Recently, we generated 1928zT2 T cells targeting CD19 by introducing the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) to 1928z [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The activation of TLR2, a canonical costimulatory receptor, promotes the regression of established leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, incorporation with TLR2 domain improves expansion of CAR-T cells and potentiates the killing capacity of CAR T cells against CD19<sup>+</sup> leukemic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Actually, the leukemia cells with potent abilities for cell migration, proliferation, adhesion, and protease activity facilitated themselves extramedullary infiltration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In this context, it is highly warranted to find tumor-specific T cells with enhanced activity against the leukemic cells of high affinity for the extramedullary relapse. The advent of novel 1928zT2 T cells with improved expansion and enhanced anti-tumor function causes it hopeful to treat such a complicated and aggressive disorder.</p><p id="Par17">In this study, we report the remarkable ability of 1928zT2 T cells to induce complete remission (CR) in extramedullary tissues of three ALL patients, who had a relapse with resistant to available therapies.

Although she had no response to chemotherapy regimen of VDLCP at first, the patient achieved CR after Hyper CVAD A therapy. She received four cycles of chemotherapy and underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) from her 10/10 HLA allele-matched sister in November, 2015. However, 9&#x000a0;months later, she had a relapse in extramedullary tissues including her left breast and multiple lymph nodes identified by Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The extramedullary leukemia in breast was confirmed histologically (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), and leukemia blast cells were detected as positive for TdT, CD19, CD20, CD79a, CD34, CD99, CD10, PAX5, and Ki67 (15%), and negative for CD3 and Cyclin D1.

Despite he received IT for more than six courses, the patient suffered from second recurrence with CNS-ALL. He had a good response to IT and irradiation and achieved CR for a third time. However, the cancer recurred again 10&#x000a0;months later with CNS and extramedullary involvement in June, 2017. The bone marrow examination still showed signs of complete remission. The whole-body PET/CT showed that extensive extramedullary relapse involving almost the entire pleura, peritoneum, pelvic fascia, pancreas, and multiple lymph nodes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>).

In this study, we also found the obvious elevations of MCP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and HGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], the critical chemokines for directing migration of lymphocytes, in the patient 2 after 1928zT2 T cells infusion, indicating the possible involvement of TLR2 in adhesive signaling. In addition, the elevations of MCP-1 and HGF were coincident with the expansion and trafficking of 1928zT2 T cells, suggesting possible roles of MCP-1 and HGF in regulating the trafficking of 1928zT2 T cells. Further studies are required to investigate the mechanisms how TLR2 incorporation promote CAR T cells to infiltrate into tumors and disrupt tumor microenvironment, which are the major challenges for treating CNS and extramedullary leukemia.</p><p id="Par40">1928zT2 T cells infusion may overcome many limitations of conventional therapies. For instance, CNS is regarded as a pharmacological sanctuary for leukemia cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, 1928zT2 T cells could traffic to the CNS and eradicate leukemia here without any overt CNS toxicities. Although some studies reported that CAR T cells emerging in CSF are associated with development of neurotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], we did not find any evidence of neurotoxicity in patient 3. It was reported that the Phase II ROCKET trial of JCAR015 (19-28z CAR T cells) was halted for ALL due to the development of sever cerebral edema and subsequent death of several patients, which was associated with rapid expansion and exhaustion of CAR T-cells with CD28. Until now, there was no direct evidence of possible causal relationships of CD28 incorporation and neurotoxicity of CAR T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. It is speculated that CAR T cells incorporating 4-1BB are more persistent and less likely to undergo exhaustion than those incorporating CD28, contributing to improved tolerability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, from the primary data of nine patients using 1928zT2 T cells with CD28 in our phase I clinical trial, no patients suffered from cerebral edema during the follow-up. Overall, the well tolerance and efficacy of 1928zT2 T cells in this study provides a promise for CNS-3 status leukemia patients, who were ineligible for CAR T cells before, though more patients are needed to be recruited in the clinical trial.</p><p id="Par41">In addition, the incorporation of CD28 and TLR2 costimulatory domains in this study was different from the other third-generation CARs, which incorporate two costimulatory domains such as CD28 and 4-1BB or OX-40. These additional costimulatory signals could improve the expansion of CAR T cells. Most third-generation CAR T cells would improve cytokine secretion due to the productive T cell-stimulation and probably induce the severe CRS in patients. At present, most available CAR T cells usage in clinical were the second-generation ones and no direct comparison between these third generation CARs was reported. In this study, it was of note that the 1928zT2 T cells infusion just induced grade 2 or 3 CRS and these patients recovered spontaneously or after treatment with tocilizumab. Although we observed an onset of several cytokines elevations in parallel with robust T cell expansion in these patients, which was consistent with previous studies suggesting some degree of CRS is probably necessary for CAR T cells efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], the rest 34 tested cytokines did not fluctuate, indicating that the limited cytokine secretion was possibly related with the low toxicity of 1928zT2 T cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par42">Our study demonstrated that the 1928zT2 T cells rapidly and reliably eradicated extramedullary and CNS leukemia and were well tolerated in these three ALL patients. Our results therefore suggested that adoptive transfer of 1928zT2 T cells has great potential to be used to treated ALL patients with extramedullary and CNS leukemia in the future.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ALL</term><def><p id="Par6">Acute lymphoblastic leukemia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>allo-HSCT</term><def><p id="Par7">Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAR-T cells</term><def><p id="Par8">Chimeric antigen receptor T cells</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CNS</term><def><p id="Par9">Central nervous system</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRS</term><def><p id="Par10">Cytokine releasing syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IT</term><def><p id="Par11">Intrathecal chemotherapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SC</term><def><p id="Par12">Systemic chemotherapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TLR2</term><def><p id="Par13">Toll-like receptor 2</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par43">This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 81671585, 81300446, 81370665, and 81522002); the Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China (2013B021800201, 2014B020212009, 2014B020226002, 2015B020227003, and 2017B020230004); Guangdong Provincial Applied Science and Technology Research &#x00026; Development Program (2016B020237006 and 2016B030229006); and the Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangzhou, China (201400000003-4).
