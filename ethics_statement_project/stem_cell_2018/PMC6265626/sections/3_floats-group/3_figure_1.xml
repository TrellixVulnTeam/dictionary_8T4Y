  <p>Serial images of brain injury induced by intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Representative coronal‐view images of a serial cranial ultrasonogram obtained before, and 1, 2, and 3 months after the transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Representative brain magnetic resonance (MRI) images were obtained at 36–40 weeks CA. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The baseline brain ventricular index, assessing anterior horn width ratio, ventricular width ratio, and trans‐occipital distance ratio were measured using cranial ultrasonogram images, which were first obtained after the onset of severe IVH. The baseline brain ventricular index is according to shunt placement in the MSC‐transplanted group. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. Abbreviations: CA 36–40w, corrected age of 36–40 weeks; Pre, pre‐MSC transplantation; Post1mo, 1 month after MSC transplantation; Post2mo, 2 months after MSC transplantation; Post3mo, 3 months after MSC transplantation.
