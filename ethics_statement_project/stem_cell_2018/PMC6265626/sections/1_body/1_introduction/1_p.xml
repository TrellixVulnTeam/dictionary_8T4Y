<p>Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), a condition resulting from the rupture of the germinal matrix through the ependymal into the lateral ventricle, mainly occurs in premature infants 
 <xref rid="sct312351-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="sct312351-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>. The risk and severity of IVH directly correlate with degree of immaturity 
 <xref rid="sct312351-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, and the improved survival of extremely preterm infants, enabled by recent advances in neonatal intensive care, has resulted in an increased number of preterm infants at high risk of developing severe IVH 
 <xref rid="sct312351-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. More than 50% of preterm infants affected by severe (grade ≥3) IVH die or develop posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) ultimately requiring shunt surgery in up to 40%–70% of cases 
 <xref rid="sct312351-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="sct312351-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="sct312351-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>. Brain injuries induced by severe IVH and exacerbated by PHH result in increased mortality, and neurologic morbidities in survivors such as seizures, cerebral palsy, and developmental delay 
 <xref rid="sct312351-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="sct312351-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="sct312351-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="sct312351-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>. Currently, no effective treatment is available to attenuate brain injury or prevent the progress of PHH after severe IVH in preterm infants. Therefore, the development of new, safe, and effective therapeutic modalities to improve the prognosis of this intractable and devastating neonatal disorder is an urgent issue.
