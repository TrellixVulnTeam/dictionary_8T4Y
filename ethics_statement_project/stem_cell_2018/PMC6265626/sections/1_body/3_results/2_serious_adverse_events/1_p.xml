<p>Details of SAEs, recorded until first discharge from the NICU, are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="sct312351-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>. All nine infants who received MSC transplantation were discharged alive. Intraventricular transplantation of human UCB‐derived MSCs was performed aseptically under ultrasound guidance. All the patients tolerated the procedure well, without immediate complications such as anaphylaxis or death within 6 hours after transplantation. However, eight patients developed SAEs including severe BPD, sepsis, NEC, ROP requiring surgery, inguinal hernia requiring surgery, and seizures (Table 
 <xref rid="sct312351-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The most common SAE was inguinal hernia, which was surgically corrected in four of the nine patients (44%). All surgeries for hernia were performed at least 3–4 months after MSC transplantation. Two infants (A1 and A2) received laser treatment for stage 3 ROP, which was diagnosed 3 months after MSC transplantation. NEIIb was diagnosed at 16 and 115 days after MSC transplantation in infants B3 and B4, respectively. One patient (B5), in the high‐dose MSC‐transplantation group, developed late‐onset sepsis and meningitis, caused by 
 <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic>, and seizures requiring anticonvulsant medication, at postnatal day (P) 29 (Table 
 <xref rid="sct312351-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Because of the extended time interval of 20 days between the transplantation of MSCs at P9, and the onset of late‐onset sepsis and meningitis at P29, it seems likely that these SAEs are not directly related to the intraventricular transplantation of MSCs. Because seizures in this patient developed with the onset of meningitis, and because seizures were observed in the other four infants before enrollment, this SAE may not be attributable to MSC transplantation. Last, although there was no mortality, five out of the nine enrolled infants (56%) with grade 4 severe IVH received a ventriculoperitoneal shunt before first NICU discharge (P40–P127). Major SAEs including rates of shunt placement, late‐onset sepsis, NEC (≥stage 2), and seizures are displayed in Table 
 <xref rid="sct312351-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>. All infants who received shunt operations in the present study had the surgery within the first 6 months of life and before their first NICU discharge.
