<p>Temporal profiles of changes in the levels of CSF cytokines and growth factors measured before and after MSC transplantation are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="sct312351-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The average level of IL‐6 measured at 36–40 weeks corrected age was significantly decreased when compared to the baseline CSF level obtained before MSC transplantation (
 <italic>p</italic> = .008). Levels in CSF of TGF‐β1/2, TNF‐α, IL‐1β, and VEGF, measured at 36–40 weeks CA, showed a tendency to decrease. The exception was infant B5, who developed late‐onset sepsis and meningitis caused by 
 <italic>E. cloacae</italic>; this infant showed increased levels of TGF‐β1/2, TNF‐α, IL‐1β, VEGF, and BDNF compared with the respective baseline values measured in CSF before MSC transplantation. The infant B1, who developed prolonged severe acidosis and hypotension before the transfer to our NICU, and received shunt placement 1 month after MSC transplantation, showed the highest CSF levels of IL‐6, TGF‐ß1, and TNF‐α compared with baseline values (Fig. 
 <xref rid="sct312351-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Baseline CSF IL‐6 levels in infants with shunt placement were significantly higher compared with those of infants without shunt placement (
 <italic>p</italic> = .03) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="sct312351-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Baseline levels of other proinflammatory cytokines, such as TGF‐β1/2, TNF‐α, and IL‐1β, in the infants with shunt placement were elevated compared with those in infants without shunt placement. However, these differences were not statistically significant. Spearman rank correlation tests revealed significant correlations between baseline IL‐6 and TNF‐α levels in CSF and initial VI and AHW (Fig. 
 <xref rid="sct312351-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b).
