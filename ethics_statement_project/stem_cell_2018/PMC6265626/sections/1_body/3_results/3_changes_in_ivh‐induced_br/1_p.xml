<p>Representative cranial ultrasound images of the nine patients with MSC transplantation, acquired pretransplantation and at 1, 2, and 3 months posttransplantation, as well as MRI images acquired at 36–40 weeks of gestational age, are displayed in Figure 
 <xref rid="sct312351-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The infant designated A1 showed an initial improvement in hemorrhage area including attenuation of periventricular hemorrhagic infarct, for up to 2 months after transplantation with MSCs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="sct312351-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). However, delayed‐progressive ventriculomegaly developed at 3 months after MSC transplantation, requiring shunt surgery at 127 postnatal days (Fig. 
 <xref rid="sct312351-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). This infant was discharged home at 135 postnatal days. The infants A2, A3, B2, and B3 showed continual improvement and regression in hemorrhage area, throughout the observation period and were discharged without shunt placement (Fig. 
 <xref rid="sct312351-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). The infants B1, B4, B5, and B6 received shunt placement because of progressive ventriculomegaly before being discharged (Fig. 
 <xref rid="sct312351-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a).
