<p>Out of the total of nine premature infants with severe (grade 4) IVH enrolled in this trial, three received a low‐dose (5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/kg) of human UCB‐derived MSCs, and the remaining six received a high‐dose (1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> cells/kg), (Table 
 <xref rid="sct312351-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Gestational age, birth weight, and postnatal age of MSC transplant recipients were 26.1 ± 2.1 weeks (range 24–30 weeks), 767 ± 231 g (range 440–1,310 g), and 11.6 ± 2.6 days (range 7–15 days), respectively. Clinical variables, including gestational age, birth weight, sex, Apgar scores, and antenatal findings of low and high dose groups are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="sct312351-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>. In the low dose group, all enrolled infants were female, and only male infants were enrolled in the high dose group.
