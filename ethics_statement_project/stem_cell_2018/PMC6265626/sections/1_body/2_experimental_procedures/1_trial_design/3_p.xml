<p>The primary outcome was establishing the feasibility and safety of escalating doses of hUCB‐derived MSCs in preterm infants. This was assessed by monitoring for: (a) dose‐limiting toxicity (DLT), defined as sudden death within 6 hours of MSC transplantation for no other known reason; (b) anaphylactic shock occurring immediately after MSC transplantation; and (c) brain tumor lesions occurring after MSC transplantation. The secondary outcome was defined as incidence of adverse events resulting from hUCB‐derived MSC transplantation. These events were classified as shunt placement, death, culture‐confirmed late‐onset sepsis, surgery required to correct retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), necrotizing enterocolitis (&gt;Bell's stage 2b), or seizure.</p>
