<p>Stem cells were prepared in compliance with good manufacturing practices at a concentration of 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/ml in normal saline. A low dose of 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> MSCs (1 ml/kg), or a high dose of 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> MSCs (2 ml/kg), was transplanted intraventricularly, via an anterior fontanelle tap, using a 24‐gauge medicut catheter guided by cranial ultrasound. Briefly, after sedation with intravenous fentanyl, the anterior fontanelle skin area was prepared and draped for the aseptic procedure. The ultrasound probe was also covered with a sterile sheath. A neurosurgeon inserted a 22‐gauge medicut needle into the dilated lateral ventricle unilaterally via the fontanelle tap under direct ultrasound guidance. After withdrawing the needle stylet through the remaining catheter, we naturally drained a volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) approximately equivalent to that of the prepared MSCs. After obtaining CSF, a syringe containing the MSCs was connected to the catheter, and MSCs were slowly injected into the lateral ventricle. The catheter was then removed, after flushing with normal saline (0.5 ml). The site of needle puncture was manually compressed for 5 minutes and aseptic dressing was applied.
