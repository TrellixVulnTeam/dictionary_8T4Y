<p>Human UCB‐derived MSCs were obtained as described in our previous (first‐in‐human) phase I clinical trial for BPD in premature infants 
 <xref rid="sct312351-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>. PNEUMOSTEM consists of ex vivo cultured allogeneic, unrelated, human umbilical cord‐blood‐derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB‐MSCs). These cells are CD45‐, CD14‐, CD34‐, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)‐DR‐negative, and are also CD73‐, CD105‐, and CD90‐positive. This immunophenotype is confirmatory for hUCB‐MSCs and distinguishes them from hematopoietic stem cells. Processing of hUCB‐MSCs involves isolation steps to remove hematopoietic elements, followed by MSC expansion from the nucleated cells in culture medium (minimum essential medium: Gibco BRL, Grand Island, New York) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells are cryopreserved at −150°C or lower in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. Before administration, frozen hUCB‐MSCs were thawed and washed with culture medium and saline. The reconstituted hUCB‐MSCs for transplantation were stored at 2°C–8°C, with a shelf life of 24 hours from the time of manufacture. Pneumostem passage‐six human UCB‐derived MSCs were purchased from MEDIPOST Co., Ltd. (Seoul, Korea). The manufacturer confirms shelf‐life stability of 24 hours by process validation and stability data for each batch. The reconstituted hUCB‐MSCs were tested for viability, phenotype, and presence of endotoxins before infusion and this information was provided as a certificate of analysis by the manufacturer. For analysis of phenotype, viability, and endotoxins in reconstituted hUCB‐MSCs, immunophenotyping was performed using flow cytometry, trypan blue exclusion, and chromogenic assays. When dispatching cells from GMP facility, the viabilities of all cell lots were over than 75% and thus every cell lot passed the acceptance criteria of cell viability &gt;70%.
