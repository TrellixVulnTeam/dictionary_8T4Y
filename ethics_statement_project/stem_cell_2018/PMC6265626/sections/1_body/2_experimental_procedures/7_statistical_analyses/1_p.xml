<p>Data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean. To compare continuous variables, statistical comparisons between groups were performed using the Mann–Whitney test. The paired 
 <italic>t</italic> test was used for assessment of the temporal profile of growth factors and cytokines in the CSF. Correlation between the ventricular parameters measured in the baseline cranial ultrasound images and the initial levels of growth factors and cytokines in the CSF was evaluated using Spearman rank correlation. The 
 <italic>p</italic> values of &lt;.05 were considered statistically significant. The software package SPSS, version 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL), was used for all statistical analyses.
