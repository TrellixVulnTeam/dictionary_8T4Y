<p>While performing cranial ultrasonography, standard views were obtained in the coronal and sagittal planes, with the anterior fontanel used as an acoustic window. To assess baseline ventricular enlargement induced by IVH, the first ultrasound images, which detected severe IVH (≥grade 3), were used to measure the dimensions of the ventricles. Three ventricular parameters were used in the present study. The ventricular index (VI) was defined as the distance between the falx and the lateral wall of the anterior horn in the coronal plane; anterior horn width (AHW) was defined as the diagonal width of the anterior horn measured at its widest point in the coronal plane; and the thalamo‐occipital distance (TOD) was defined as the distance between the outermost point of the thalamus at its junction with the choroid plexus and the outermost part of the occipital horn in the parasagittal plane
