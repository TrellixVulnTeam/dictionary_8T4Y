<p>To assess changes in the levels of cytokines and growth factors associated with the extent of inflammation of the brain after severe IVH, CSF was collected via the anterior fontanelle tap immediately before MSC transplantation, and by lumbar puncture after MSC transplantation, at 36–40 weeks of corrected gestational age. Supernatant was frozen at −70°C after centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 minutes. The levels of the following cytokines and growth factors were measured according to the manufacturer's protocols: interleukin (IL)‐1β, IL‐6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‐α, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Measurements were performed using the Magnetic Luminex Performance Assay kit (R&amp;D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). Transforming growth factor (TGF)‐β1/2, brain‐derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) were assessed with a Quantikine ELISA kit (R&amp;D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). Cytokine analysis of CSF was performed by Seoul Clinical Laboratories (Yonginsi, Kyonggido, Korea), who also verified the inter‐assay and intraassay reliability of the cytokine profiles.</p>
