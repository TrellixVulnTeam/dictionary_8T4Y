 <xref rid="sct312351-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> and DLT. As part of routine NICU care, vital signs were continuously monitored with an electrocardiogram and recorded in an electronic medical record system. A cranial ultrasonogram was performed at baseline (screening point), then at the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th week after MSC transplantation. Cranial ultrasonogram was also used for additional reassessment as needed. Brain MRI was performed at 36–40 weeks of corrected gestational age. Collection of CSF was carried out via the fontanelle tap immediately before MSC transplantation and via spinal tap at 36–40 weeks of corrected gestational age.
