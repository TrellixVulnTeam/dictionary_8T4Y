  <p>The present phase I clinical trial is the first in human study of mesenchymal stem cells transplantation for severe intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants. No infant died or showed serious adverse effects related with stem cell transplantation in this study. Intraventricular transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells in preterm infants with severe intraventricular hemorrhage might be safe and feasible and warrants further phase II study.</p>
