<p>Determining the optimal route for MSC transplantation is an important issue that needs to be addressed for successful clinical translation. In newborn rats with severe IVH, we found that local intraventricular transplantation of MSCs was fivefold more effective for attenuating brain injury than systemic intravenous administration, although the two routes are not mutually exclusive 
 <xref rid="sct312351-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>. In this study, MSCs were administered intraventricularly under ultrasonography guidance via a bedside ventricular tap placed through the open anterior fontanel. This approach did not require further invasive surgery in our cohort of premature infants with severe IVH. The procedure was well tolerated even by the smallest infant weighing 400 g. No clinical instability, SAEs, DLT, or complications related to MSC transplantation were observed in any of the nine infants. Collectively, these findings suggest that local intraventricular transplantation of MSCs in preterm infants with severe IVH is safe and feasible, and may be a therapeutically more effective delivery route than systemic intravenous transplantation.
