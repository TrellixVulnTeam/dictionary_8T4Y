<p>Identifying the most vulnerable preterm infants, with the highest rates of mortality and morbidity, by cautious risk–benefit evaluation is important for clinical use of these potentially beneficial rescue therapies. As over 50% of preterm infants with severe (grade ≥ 3) IVH die or develop PHH, ultimately requiring shunt placement in 40%–70% of cases
