<p>Determining the optimal timing of MSC transplantation is another key issue that requires resolution. In our previous preclinical study, conducted to optimize the timing of MSC transplantation in severe IVH, early intraventricular transplantation of MSCs protected against IVH‐induced brain injuries and progressive PHH, when delivered 2 days after induction of severe IVH, but not at 7 days 
 <xref rid="sct312351-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref>. Based on these preclinical data showing a narrow therapeutic time window, this clinical trial was designed to transplant MSCs within 7 days following the first detection of severe IVH (≥3) with cranial ultrasonography, on average at postnatal day 12. Further studies are needed to clarify whether MSC transplantation close to the onset of severe IVH provides the best therapeutic outcomes.
