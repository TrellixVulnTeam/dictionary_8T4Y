<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial to test the safety and feasibility of MSC transplantation for severe IVH in premature infants. In this study, intraventricular transplantation with low‐dose (5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/kg) or high‐dose (1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> cells/kg) of allogeneic human UCB‐derived MSCs was not associated with immediate SAEs or DLT and showed no mortality in our cohort of extremely preterm infants with grade 4 IVH. These findings suggest that intraventricular transplantation of up to 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> cells/kg of human UCB‐derived MSCs into preterm infants with severe IVH may be safe and feasible.
