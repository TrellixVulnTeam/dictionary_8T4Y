<p>In the present study, there was no mortality in the MSC transplantation group. This finding may suggest that intracerebroventricular MSC transplantation might not be considered as an aggravating factor for mortality in preterm infants with severe IVH, who are at risk for mortality. However, due to the inevitable limitations of phase I study design, including small sample size, further well‚Äêdesigned controlled studies are necessary to confirm the safety and therapeutic efficacy of MSC transplantation.</p>
