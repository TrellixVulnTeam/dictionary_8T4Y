<p>The optimal dose of MSCs to be used for transplantation is also unclear. We previously demonstrated that local intraventricular transplantation of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> MSCs significantly attenuated brain injury and the progress of PHH after severe IVH in newborn rats

 <xref rid="sct312351-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>. These findings suggest that the site of injury and the delivery route of MSCs are the major determinants of optimal dose. Currently, no guidelines are available for the extrapolation of preclinical data 
 <xref rid="sct312351-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> into clinical trials. We extrapolated from the cell doses used in animal studies, based on body weight and ventricular volume; thus, in this study we performed an intraventricular transplantation of 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/kg for the low dose, and 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> cells/kg for the high dose. Further studies will be necessary to ascertain the optimal MSC doses for transplantation into preterm infants with severe IVH.
