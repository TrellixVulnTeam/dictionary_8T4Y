<p>There have been various interventions to prevent PHH in neonates with IVH, including repeated lumbar puncture, drug treatment to reduce CSF, and intraventricular fibrinolytic therapy, but no randomized trial has been conducted to investigate their efficacy and safety

A pioneering randomized trial for neonatal IVH using drainage, irrigation and fibrinolytic therapy showed severe cognitive disability in survivors and overall death or severe disability, when neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed at 2‐year follow‐up

Hence, to prove the safety and efficacy of MSCs as a therapeutic strategy, a double‐blind randomized controlled phase II clinical trial with follow‐up evaluation is necessary. A phase II trial to determine the therapeutic efficacy of MSC treatment of IVH in premature infants is currently underway (NCT02890953).
