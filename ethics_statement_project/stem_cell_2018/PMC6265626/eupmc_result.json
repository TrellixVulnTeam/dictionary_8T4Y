To assess the safety and feasibility of MSCs in preterm infants with severe IVH, we performed a phase I dose-escalation clinical trial. The first three patients received a low dose of MSCs (5 \u00d7 106 cells/kg), and the next six received a high dose (1 \u00d7 107 cells/kg). We assessed adverse outcomes, including mortality and the progress of posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Intraventricular transplantation of MSCs was performed in nine premature infants with mean gestational age of 26.1 \u00b1 0.7 weeks and birth weight of 808 \u00b1 85 g at 11.6 \u00b1 0.9 postnatal days. Treatment with MSCs was well tolerated, and no patients showed serious adverse effects or dose-limiting toxicities attributable to MSC transplantation. There was no mortality in IVH patients receiving MSCs. Infants who underwent shunt surgery showed a higher level of interleukin (IL)-6 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained before MSC transplantation in comparison with infants who did not receive a shunt. Levels of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 in initially obtained CSF correlated significantly with baseline ventricular index. Intraventricular transplantation of allogeneic human UCB-derived MSCs into preterm infants with severe IVH is safe and feasible, and warrants a larger, and controlled, phase II study.
