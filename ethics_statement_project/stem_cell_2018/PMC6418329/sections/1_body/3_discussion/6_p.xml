<p>In the study done by Bartonak et al. in 2013, cardiac EF and size improved significantly. Moreover, clinical parameters such as QoL and event-free survival also improved. The type of injected cells was cardiopoietic, with which a better therapeutic response is seen in treatment, considering their specificity. Their findings on QoL were similar to ours, despite the difference in the questionnaire type and the 6-month follow-up period [
