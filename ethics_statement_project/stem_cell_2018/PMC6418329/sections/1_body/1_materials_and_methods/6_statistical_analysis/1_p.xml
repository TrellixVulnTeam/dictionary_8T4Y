<p>The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Statistics 17.0) software was used to analyze the data. All continuous variables are expressed as mean Â± SD and for some categorical as numbers and percentages. All variables were tested for normal distribution. Paired samples t-test was used to compare quantitative variables before and after treatment in each group, and independent samples t-test was used for intergroup comparisons. Qualitative variables were compared with the chi-square test. A multivariate linear regression analysis using a simultaneous entry of predictors was performed to examine which variables were correlated independently to QoL scores. A p-value of 0.05 or lower was considered statistically significant.</p>
