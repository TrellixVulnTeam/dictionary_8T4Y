 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> summarizes the baseline and follow-up variables for the study and control groups. As shown in this table, the QoL in patients in the stem cell therapy group improved significantly three months after receiving the treatment. The questionnaire score increased from 41±7.6 before treatment to 53.13±5.33 three months after treatment (P=0.001). The LVEF also showed a meaningful difference in these patients rising from 24.77±6.35 (before treatment) to 31.3±5.09 three months after receiving the treatment (P=0.001). Moreover, the NYHA function class showed a significant improvement in reducing from 3±0.83 to 2.4±0.67 during the same period (P=0.002).
