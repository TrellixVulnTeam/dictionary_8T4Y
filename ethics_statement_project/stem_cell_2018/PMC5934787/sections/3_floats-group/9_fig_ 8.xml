   <bold>a</bold> Shows the arterial stiffness parameter, augmentation index adjusted for a heart rate of 75. Saxagliptin subjects remained stable across visit 1 through 3, whereas the control subjects had an increase in arterial stiffness (p = 0.04). 
   <bold>b</bold> Shows radial systolic blood pressure in saxagliptin, compared to Placebo, across the three visits. Saxagliptin blood pressure remains stable across visits 1 and 2, but then drops in visit 3. In the placebo group, blood pressure drops at visit 2, but then rises dramatically by visit 3 (p = 0.009)
