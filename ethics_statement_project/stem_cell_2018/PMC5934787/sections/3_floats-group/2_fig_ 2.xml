  <p>Migration of CD34+ cells in response to SDF-1α (100 ng/mL). Results are expressed as fluorescence ratio between cells exposed to the chemotactic factor and cells exposed to chemoattractant-free media (control) followed by lysis in presence of CyQuant GR dye. Experiments were performed in duplicate and results are given as mean ± SD (p &lt; 0.05)</p>
