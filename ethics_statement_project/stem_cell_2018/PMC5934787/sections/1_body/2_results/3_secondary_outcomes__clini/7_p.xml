<p id="Par86">When analyzing the arterial stiffness, augmentation index that was adjusted for a heart rate of 75 (AI-75), was found to be statistically significant (p = 0.04), with the values for the control group increasing across visit 1 through 3. Saxagliptin subjects have a slight decline across the three visits (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a). Systolic blood pressure, measured radially, was found to be statistically significant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b; p = 0.009). There was a trend level significant reduction for systolic blood pressure, measured arterially (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>; p = 0.061), however not all subjects had PWV measured, therefore lack of statistical difference (though there was a trend) between the groups may not be a true reflection.
