<p id="Par84">Venous blood biochemistries were gathered both through Labcorp of America and through serum ELISA. Both standard of care, and research values were collected. In the Labcorp values, only adiponectin (p = 0.01) was statistically significant across the saxagliptin and placebo groups. The placebo group had a steady increase across visit 1 through 3, but the saxagliptin saw an overall stable value of adiponectin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a). Serum creatinine remained relatively stable throughout the study in the saxagliptin group, but showed a drastic decrease after visit 1 in the placebo group, before the values leveled out (p = 0.12, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b). There was no correlating significant or trend level significant noticed in eGFR (p = 0.36), or BUN. There were no statistically significant changes between groups in either GLP1 or SDF-1α, performed by ELISA.
