<p id="Par83">Body composition measures showed no statistically significant changes. A high correlative effect was seen in the Tanita body composition scale measures for fat free mass (FFM, p = 0.07) and percent body fat, (p = 0.08). Mean FFM, by visit, drops more from visit 1 to visit 2 in the saxagliptin group, than the control group at a trend level significance (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a). Percent body fat, while being higher on average in the saxagliptin group than the placebo group, showed a decline after visit 2. Conversely, the placebo group had an increase after visit 2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). A trend was also noticed in total body water (TBW, p = 0.1), which was seen to decline from visit 1 to visit 2, and then a rise again at visit 3 in the saxagliptin group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c). In the control group, however, TBW remains stable until visit 2, when it begins to fall for visit 3.
