<p id="Par78">The number of CD34+ cells present in the MNCs pool is relatively low in patients with diabetes. Thus, in this study the number of CD34+ cells obtained for isolation of mRNA was not always sufficient or adequate in order to obtain confident gene expression analysis. As an alternative we looked at mRNA gene expression from CD34− cells (Mononuclear cell population (MNC) minus CD34+ cells). CD34− cell population is largely reflective of the MNC population (minus approx. 1% CD34+ cells).</p>
