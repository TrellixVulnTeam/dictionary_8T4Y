<p id="Par76">The percentage of CD34+ cells purified from the MNCs population did not show any significant difference neither at baseline nor along the study between treatment and control groups. Although EPCs (CD34+) number did not differ by treatment group (2.8% ± 0.5 for saxagliptin group vs 2.0% ± 0.3 for placebo group), the migratory response of CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells to the chemotactic factor SDF-1α (100 ng/mL) was significantly greater (p = 0.04). This functional improvement can be better appreciated at visit 2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). For lower concentration of SDF-1α (10 ng/mL) there was no significant difference between the groups.
