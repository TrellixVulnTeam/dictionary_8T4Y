<p id="Par77">The functional improvement of CD34+ cells described above (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) reflects the higher percentage of CD34+ CXCR4+ expression (visit 1 = 5.6% ± 1.0; visit 2 = 8.5% ± 1.1; visit 3 = 7.1% ± 1.2) present in the MNCs after saxagliptin treatment. Therefore, a 12-week trial of saxagliptin therapy led to a significant increase in circulating EPCs expressing CXCR4 (measured by flow cytometry; p &lt; 0.01) facilitating the migration process promoted by SDF-1α (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Remarkably, there was a dramatic increase in CD34+ CXCR4+ cell numbers particularly at visit 2 (at 6 weeks of treatment), in spite of lower levels in saxagliptin group at the onset or visit 1. Similarly, in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, we noted increased number of circulating endothelial cells, identified as CD31+ cells on flow-cytometry, across visits 2 and 3.
