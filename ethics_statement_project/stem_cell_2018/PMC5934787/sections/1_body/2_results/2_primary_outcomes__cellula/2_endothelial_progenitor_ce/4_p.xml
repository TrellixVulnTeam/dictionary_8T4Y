<p id="Par79">Gene expression analysis was performed for antioxidants (SOD1, SOD2, GPX1, CAT), apoptosis (BCL-2, CDKN1A, TP53, CASP-3), endothelial function (VEGFA, VEGFR2, EDN-1, eNOS, IGF1), cell chemotaxis (SDF-1α, CXCR4), inflammation (IL-6, TNFα), progenitor marker (CD34) and endothelial lineage cell surface markers (PECAM1). For CD34+ cells, upregulation (2.1-fold) was observed for SOD1 (p &lt; 0.05); while for CD34− cells, downregulation was observed for IL-6 (approximately 40%) and IGF-1 (approximately 60%) (p &lt; 0.01) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). There was also a trend for upregulation (p = 0.1893) for GPX1 expression for CD34+ cells. Both GPX1 and SOD1 are cytosolic anti-oxidants, which appear to increase in expression post saxagliptin therapy. For CD34− cells a trend for downregulation was noted for caspase 3 (p = 0.08) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), a well-known pro-apoptotic gene.
