<p id="Par56">Since poor viability and impaired function of EPCs in early diabetes will ultimately affect the repair and regeneration of the endothelium, a prompt intervention may help to reduce or reverse cardiovascular risk by improving EPCs survival and function above and beyond adequate glucose metabolism control. In this 12Â week placebo-controlled clinical trial, we investigated the effect of saxagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, in addition to metformin and exercise, on endothelial dysfunction in early type 2 diabetes patients who do not have any established macro-vascular complications.</p>
