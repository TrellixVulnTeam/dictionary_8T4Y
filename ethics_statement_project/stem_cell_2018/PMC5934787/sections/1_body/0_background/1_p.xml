<p id="Par52">Type 2 diabetes is a national epidemic, affecting 11% of adults in the United States [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Both diabetes and prediabetes are associated with significant macro and microvascular complications, including endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, endothelial cell inflammation, cardiovascular pro-thrombotic states, and kidney disease [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs, defined here as CD34+ cells), which are specialized cells responsible for endothelial repair and neo-angiogenesis, play an important role in diabetes. It has been shown that EPCs are impaired in number, function and gene expression in hyperglycemia and diabetes related complications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Moreover, it has been reported that EPCs (CD34+) from diabetic patients failed to incorporate and repair damaged vessels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. EPCs can act as a cellular biomarker that is more reliable than serum based markers for estimating and following endothelial dysfunction in early type 2 diabetes patients. Thus, investigating EPCs could help develop a cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk estimation [
