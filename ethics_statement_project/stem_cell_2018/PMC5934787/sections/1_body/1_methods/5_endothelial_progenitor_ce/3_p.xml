<p id="Par63">CD34+ gene expression analysis was performed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). CD34+ total mRNA was extracted and purified using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). mRNA was then converted into cDNA by using the high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Possible gene expression changes promoted by Saxagliptin were assessed by a CFX96 real-time qPCR system (Bio-Rad) using TaqMan Universal Master Mix II (Applied Biosystems) and inventoried probes. The gene expression analysis included antioxidants, apoptosis, endothelial function, chemotaxis, inflammation, and endothelial lineage cell surface markers. The expression of individual gene was normalized to either housekeeping 18S or GAPDH and calculated by using the 2
 <sup>−∆∆Ct</sup> method considering the difference in cycle threshold between visit 2 or visit 3 and baseline (visit 1). Gene expression of CD34− cell population was also analyzed along with CD34+ cells.
