<p id="Par62">To isolate EPCs (CD34+), MNCs were magnetically sorted through a column after cells were stained with CD34 microbeads antibody (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). According to the manufacturer and based on flow cytometry analysis, the purity of CD34+ cells post sorting is 67% (before gating on white blood cells). An aliquot of CD34+ cells were then stained with trypan blue and counted using an Auto Cellometer Mini (Nexcelom Bioscience, Lawrence, MA).</p>
