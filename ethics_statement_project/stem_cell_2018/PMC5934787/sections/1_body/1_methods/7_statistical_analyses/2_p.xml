<p id="Par72">For each dependent variable (dv), we used a random effects mixed model with robust standard errors to estimate the group (saxagliptin/placebo) main effect, the visit (1, 2, 3) main effect, and the group x visit interaction. The main effect of group tells whether the saxagliptin patients vs controls differed on the dv independently of visit. The visit main effect tells us whether the dv mean changed across visits, independently of treatment group. The treatment x visit interaction was of primary interest, since this tells us whether the treatment and control groups had different slopes over visits, i.e. whether the pattern of scores over time differed based on treatment. Because there was a slight change in the laboratory procedure for CFU and migration outcome measurements after subject 20, we also considered this variation and included 3-way interaction tests (group x visit x early/late) in the model for these parameters. Since subjects were randomized to treatment, baseline subject variables that differed between treatments could not act as confounds (i.e. could not cause a spurious association between treatment and outcome, because they could not affect treatment assignment). Therefore, randomized controlled trials do not usually adjust for baseline differences. However, as a sensitivity analysis, for dependent variables with significant effects, we included as a covariate in the mixed model, any baseline variable that differed between treatment groups with p &lt; 0.10.</p>
