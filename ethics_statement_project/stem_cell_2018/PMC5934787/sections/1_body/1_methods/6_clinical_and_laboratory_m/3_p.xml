<p id="Par67">Body composition parameters were gathered both manually and using a Tanita BF-350 body composition scale. Manual measurements include: height, weight, BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference. The Tanita scale works via bio-impedance, and provides measures on: weight, BMI, percent body fat, fat mass (kg), fat free mass (kg), percent body water, water mass (kg), basal metabolic rate (kcal), daily calorie intake (kcal), and impedance.</p>
