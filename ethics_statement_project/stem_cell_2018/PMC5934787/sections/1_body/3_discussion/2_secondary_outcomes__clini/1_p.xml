<p id="Par95">All subjects were on a stable dose of metformin (1–2 grams/day) for 3 months or greater prior to enrollment. Subjects were instructed to engage in 150 min of moderate intensity physical activity per week, as per the American Diabetes Association guidelines, prior to being randomized into either the saxagliptin or placebo group. The Actigraph energy monitor data analysis showed no difference in activity across all exercise intensity levels between saxagliptin and placebo. This indicates that no changes for any outcome measure in the saxagliptin group can be attributed to exercise alone.</p>
