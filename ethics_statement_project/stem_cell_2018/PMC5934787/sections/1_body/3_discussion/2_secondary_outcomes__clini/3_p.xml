<p id="Par97">Previous studies investigating DPP-IV inhibitor therapy, mainly sitagliptin and vildagliptin, in a type 2 diabetes population found that there was no significant reduction in HbA1C values with treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. This is consistent with our results, upon comparing the saxagliptin and placebo groups. In the saxagliptin group HbA1c decreased by 0.3% (less than expected), and the baseline HbA1c value was higher than placebo group. The difference in the baseline HbA1c value between groups and the little HbA1c reduction on the saxagliptin group is unlikely to explain the positive effect of saxagliptin on CD34+ EPC primarily based on HbA1C changes. Therefore, the positive changes that we see such as in migration response of EPCs to SDF1a and flow cytometry is unlikely to be secondary to improvement in glycemic indices. One study conducted by Li et al. found a significant improvement in HbA1C with saxagliptin therapy over 12 weeks, but these subjects were naïve to anti-diabetic therapy prior to entering the study [

While the meta-analysis conducted by Liu et al. found that treatment with DPP-4 inhibitors resulted in an increase in adiponectin, as compared to control, our results showed the opposite [
