<p id="Par96">Saxagliptin is a weight neutral medication, and thus it was not expected that we would find a difference between groups in the weight [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. There also was no change in waist or hip circumference measurements, which is consistent with other studies involving saxagliptin and linagliptin, although these studies did not have concomitant metformin therapy [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Previous studies involving mice have shown that treatment with DPP-4 inhibitors in hyperglycemic, obese mice resulted in reductions in adiposity, both in body fat percentage, and abdominal fat mass [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. This was attributed to an increase in energy expenditure, which was measured via monitoring metabolic rate and food intake. Our research subjects taking saxagliptin had reductions in both fat free mass (kg) and percent fat as compared to placebo, however, there was no difference between groups in resting energy expenditure values or exercise levels. The changes in fat mass, therefore, could likely be attributed to saxagliptin. The reduction in fat mass could be secondary to increased fat oxidation in lean and obese conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Total body water showed a rise from visit 2 to 3 in the saxagliptin group, whereas the control group remained steady. One reason might be related to the increase of heart failure rate noticed in the SAVOR-TIMI trial, however this trial, unlike ours, involved a population with pre-existing CVD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Interestingly, reduction in fat mass and increase in TBW would keep the weight of the subjects neutral as seen in most trials with DPP4 inhibitors, however this may not be clinically relevant in subjects with no overt heart failure [
