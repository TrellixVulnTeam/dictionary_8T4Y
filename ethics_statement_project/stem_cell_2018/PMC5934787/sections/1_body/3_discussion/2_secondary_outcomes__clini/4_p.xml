<p id="Par98">We noted a stable serum creatinine in the saxagliptin group compared to the placebo group. The eGFR was not statistically significant (p = 0.36), which may be because the eGFRs for the placebo group were initially lower and remained stable throughout the study. On the other hand, despite creatinine starting higher, it improved significantly in the 1st phase of the study. Therefore, improvement in plasma creatinine may be an acute effect rather than persistent or chronic effect. This maybe an interesting finding considering the fact that diabetes related kidney disease is a progressive disease. This could be explained by the fact that saxagliptin most likely has a renal protective effect. A higher percentage of CD34+ CXCR4+ cells may which help by homing-in on the kidney vasculature to repair the endothelial dysfunction present and thereby help prevent progressive kidney damage [
