<p id="Par101">ELISA was performed on patient serum samples to check for the presence of GLP1, and SDF-1α, in order to confirm that the saxagliptin was effectively blocking DPP-4 in the body. We were anticipating an increase in serum GLP1and SDF-1α in the saxagliptin group, indicating that DPP-4 was successfully inhibited. However, our results found no statistical significance between saxagliptin and placebo groups. It is likely that metformin leads to a significant increase of GLP-1 as seen in obese non diabetic and type 2 diabetes subjects, therefore the addition of saxagliptin would not show any further appreciable changes [
