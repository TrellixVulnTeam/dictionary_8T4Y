<p id="Par102">Limitations of our study may include the relatively short duration of 12Â week saxagliptin therapy, which may have been inadequate to see significant changes in certain clinical and cellular parameters. This may have been because of the small sample size, and due to the difficulty in obtaining all measures, in some patients. Further studies with a larger population and longer duration would be helpful to further explore and consolidate the mechanisms behind our findings.</p>
