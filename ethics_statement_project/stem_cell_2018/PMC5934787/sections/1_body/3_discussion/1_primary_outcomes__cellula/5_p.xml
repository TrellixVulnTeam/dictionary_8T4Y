<p id="Par92">Although we did not observe a statistically significant increase in CD34+ cells, the higher percentage of CD34+ CXCR4+ (double positive cell) for patients undergoing saxagliptin treatment was confirmed by our flow cytometry results (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). We also noted increased CD31 positive cells that were CXCR4 positive (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). CXCR4 is the receptor to SDF1α ligand. Similarly, other investigators have shown increase in the number of CD31+ cells as a positive outcome marker for cardiovascular risk assessment [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. It was noted that both CD34+ cells (a progenitor endothelial cell pool) and CD31+ cells (a mature circulating endothelial cell pool) had increased in double positivity with SDF1α receptor CXCR4 indicating positive effect of saxagliptin on endothelial lineage cells both immature and mature. It has been reported that CD34+ cells from patients with type 2 diabetes have defective chemotaxis to SDF-1α resulting in reduced vasculogenic potential [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Here, we showed that migratory response to SDF-1α of CD34+ cells is improved by saxagliptin. These results corroborate with the fact that CD34+ cells expressed more CXCR4 receptor and thereby facilitating the responsiveness to the SDF-1α ligand. Altogether, these results indicate that colony formation ability and mobilization of EPCs can be improved in patients with type 2 diabetes subjected to saxagliptin treatment. Similarly CD31+/CXCR4+ cell number also increased post saxagliptin therapy. While saxagliptin and metformin promoted similar beneficial effects on endothelial function when used separately, our results indicate a synergistic positive effect of saxagliptin to the entire endothelial lineage [
