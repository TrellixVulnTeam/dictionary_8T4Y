<p id="Par93">Effects of sitagliptin, another DPP-4 inhibitor, on EPCs have been previously reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In type 2 diabetic patients, sitagliptin promoted increase in circulating EPCs followed by upregulation of SDF-1α [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In a mouse model, SDF-1α was also increased and in addition to increased EPCs number those results indicated that sitagliptin has a great potential as a promoter of neovascularization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However in our study, saxagliptin therapy did not show an increase in SDF-1α plasma levels (measured by ELISA). There are still no data showing the minimum period of time for administration of saxagliptin in order to demonstrate an increase in SDF-1α levels. Therefore, our results could be secondary to a short-term intervention of 12 weeks and it is likely that plasma levels did not show increase as optimal time for detecting a statistical difference between placebo and saxagliptin. Interestingly, SDF-1α mRNA expression of EPCs was also not upregulated, in spite of increased CXCR4− expressing CD34+ cell number. In fact, there was a trend towards down-regulation of SDF-1α in the mRNA expression from cells that were exposed to saxagliptin, which may indicate that saxagliptin is rescuing the cells from damage and dysfunction, as SDF-1α is a factor that is primarily produced from damaged cells rather than healthy cells. Therefore the gene expression of SDF-1α ligand in healthy EPCs may actually decrease [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The lack of effects of saxagliptin on SDF-1α plasma levels needs to be confirmed in larger and longer outcome studies.
