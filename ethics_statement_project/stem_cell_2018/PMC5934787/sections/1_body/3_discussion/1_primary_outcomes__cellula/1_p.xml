<p id="Par88">We have defined EPCs as CD34+ cells. Werner et al. defined EPCs as CD34/KDR positive cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, if an investigator uses two markers to isolate EPCs from mononuclear cells (MNCs) rather than one, the percentage of positive cells drops by almost 10-fold. In this study, only 60–80 mls of whole blood such a drop makes a cell based clinical trial difficult to interpret. Therefore, we have used only one marker, CD34+ve, so that we get consistently close to 1% population of MNC, as EPCs.
