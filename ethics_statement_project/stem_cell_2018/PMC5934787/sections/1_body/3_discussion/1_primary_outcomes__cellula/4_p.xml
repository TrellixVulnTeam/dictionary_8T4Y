<p id="Par91">Our data also indicated a trend for an increase of CD34+ cell number for the saxagliptin group. On the other hand, other results recently published showed a significant increase of EPCs number (CD34+ CD133+ KDR+) when patients were subjected to either saxagliptin or metformin alone [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. These results indicate that the combination of these two drugs may not promote additional increase in number of CD34+ cells in the periphery blood. It is possible that the subjects may have reached the maximum threshold already by using metformin. Metformin has a dual effect by simultaneously increasing VEGFA and reducing both CXCL10 and TIMP1 in CD34+ cells in a model of the diabetic state combined with hypoxia, and also shows a proangiogenic activity [
