<p id="Par89">In this study we show for the first time that saxagliptin, in addition to metformin, positively modulates CD34+ EPCs, as a marker of vascular endothelial function, in early onset type 2 diabetes subjects who have no overt cardiovascular complications. Vascular complications are common in subjects with diabetes and a reduced number of EPCs in these subjects can predict early onset of vascular complications [

Therefore, in order to assess cardiovascular risk using a cell as a biomarker rather than serum biochemistry, it is important to investigate the number and functionality of endothelial progenitors and whether these cells can adequately promote or help with endothelial repair and angiogenesis [
