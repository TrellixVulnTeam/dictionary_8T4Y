<p id="Par94">Regarding gene expression, we looked at pathways involving inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, EPC chemotaxis pathways and endothelial function markers, in both CD34+ and CD34− cells obtained post magnetic column separation of MNCs. The mRNA expression results that stand out (statistically significant) are the antioxidants such as SOD1 (superoxide dismutase) and GPX1 (glutathione peroxidase) with clear upregulation, post Saxagliptin exposure, compared to placebo. This is concurrent with reduced inflammatory and apoptosis cascade markers such as IL6 and Caspase-3 mRNA expressions in CD34− cells indicating an overall reduction in inflammation and apoptosis pathway, which could be secondary to upregulation in antioxidants. This is particularly interesting as there is sufficient evidence from our previous work, to suggest significant patho-physiological role of ROS (anti-oxidant expression may increase in response to increased intracellular ROS presence) in not only EPCs but also in MSCs in a setting of hyperglycemia, as seen in diabetes [
