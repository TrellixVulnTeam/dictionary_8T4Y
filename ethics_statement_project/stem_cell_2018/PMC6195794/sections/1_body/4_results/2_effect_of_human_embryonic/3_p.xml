<p id="p0095">Focal preretinal pigmentation (on the inner surface of the retina) developed in 2 participants (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). In 1 participant (patient 1), preretinal pigmentation was associated with limited adherence to advice to maintain a supine position after surgery; in this instance, the area of preretinal pigmentation increased progressively during the 12-month period, but subsequently stabilized (data not shown). One participant (patient 12) demonstrated a nonpigmented and noncontractile epiretinal membrane over the injection site at month 6; this subsequently stabilized in extent with no measurable effect on visual function. Focal pigmented deposits were evident in the vitreous cavity in 2 participants (patients 6 and 7), both of whom reported visual floaters.
