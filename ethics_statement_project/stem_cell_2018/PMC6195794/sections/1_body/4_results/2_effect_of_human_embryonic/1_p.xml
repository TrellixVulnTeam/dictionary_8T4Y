<p id="p0085">Within 4 weeks of administration of hESC-derived RPE cells, subretinal hyperpigmentation developed within the area of injection of the cell suspension in all 12 participants (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The mean area of subretinal hyperpigmentation increased progressively, at a rate that seemed to be dose dependent during the first 3 months, and subsequently slowed (

A subsequent modest reduction in area of subretinal hyperpigmentation was evident in 2 participants (patients 4 and 9). The mean area of subretinal pigmentation at 12 months was correlated directly with the dose of hESC-derived RPE cells administered (
