<p id="p0075">We administered hESC-derived RPE cells to 12 participants (age range, 34–53 years) with molecularly proven advanced STGD1 (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The hESC-derived RPE cells were reconstituted and administered subretinally by 2 of the authors—patients 1 through 11 by J.W.B.B. and patient 12 by D.S.—to the predefined target regions, which were inferior to the inferotemporal vascular arcade in 10 eyes and superior to the superotemporal arcade in 2 eyes (patients 5 and 11; 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). We performed intraoperative prophylactic retinopexy for pre-existing pigmented retinal breaks in 2 participants (patients 3 and 5) and for atrophic retinal holes in 2 participants (patients 10 and 11). In 1 participant (patient 12), cryoretinopexy and injection of sulphahexafluouride gas were performed for 2 small superonasal retinal tears and a small inferotemporal retinal dialysis with localized avulsion of pars plana epithelium. In all eyes, the bleb of subretinal fluid resorbed clinically within 24 hours, with no persistent or unplanned retinal detachment. Small subretinal hemorrhages at the injection sites were evident in 2 participants (patients 1 and 12). Mild postoperative vitreous cavity hemorrhage in 1 participant (patient 5), arising from a pars plana entry site, cleared spontaneously within 4 weeks. A mild asymptomatic posterior subcapsular lens opacity was evident in 1 participant (patient 6) at month 9. Adverse events related to immunosuppression in 5 participants (patients 5, 6, 7, 10, and 12) included lethargy, headache, nausea, and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) reactivation. All participants completed 12 weeks of immunosuppression after transplantation.
