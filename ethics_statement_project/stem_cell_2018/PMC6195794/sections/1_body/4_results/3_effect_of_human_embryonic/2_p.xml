<p id="p0105">We investigated retinal sensitivity in detail using mesopic microperimetry (Nidek MP-1). We measured retinal sensitivity at loci in the macular area (central 20°) in both the study eye (including a variable portion of the transplanted area) and contralateral eye (in all except patient 12) and calculated the change in sensitivity from baseline (

A borderline improvement in retinal sensitivity of the study eye in 1 participant (patient 7) was evident at 3 months only. The mean retinal sensitivity in all 4 dose groups remained within the limits of the test–retest variability.
