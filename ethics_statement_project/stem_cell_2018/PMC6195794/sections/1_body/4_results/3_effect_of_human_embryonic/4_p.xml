<p id="p0115">We calculated the mean full-field retinal sensitivity in both the study eyes and control eyes of each dose cohort (in all participants except patients 6 and 12) by full-field static perimetry (Octopus 900). Deterioration in full-field sensitivity was evident in both the study and control eyes of 2 participants (patients 2 and 4), and an associated reduction in both the study and control eyes of the 100 000-cell dose cohort to the lower limit of test–retest variability (
