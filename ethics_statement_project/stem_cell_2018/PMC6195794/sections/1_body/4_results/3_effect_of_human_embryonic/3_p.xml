<p id="p0110">For the study eyes of 8 participants (all except patients 1, 6, 7, and 12, for whom the assessment was unavailable or unreliable) we measured in greater detail, using a stimulus grid of high density, the sensitivity of the area of retina specifically targeted with the hESC-derived RPE cell suspension. The total retinal sensitivities of each eye and the mean sensitivities of each dose group remained within the limits of testâ€“retest variability during the 12-month period (

To quantify the spatial correlation of retinal sensitivity with hyperpigmentation, we measured the change in retinal sensitivity at 12 months at hyperpigmented and nonhyperpigmented loci (

To demonstrate highly localized changes in retinal sensitivity, we derived corresponding topographic contour maps using Visual Field Modelling and Analysis software
