<p id="p0030">We enrolled 12 participants with clinical features of STGD1, electroretinographic evidence of generalized rod and cone photoreceptor cell dysfunction, and molecular characterization of mutations in 
 <italic>ABCA4</italic>. We excluded candidates in whom the visual acuity (VA) of their poorer-seeing eye was 20/400 or better, those with any history of malignant neoplasia or significant ocular pathologic features other than STGD1, any contraindication to systemic immunosuppression or surgery under general anaesthesia, and women who were pregnant or lactating. We enrolled participants sequentially into escalating dose groups of 50 000, 100 000, 150 000, and 200 000 hESC-derived RPE cells. Each dose group included 3 participants. For each participant, we selected the poorer-seeing eye (according to dominance and VA) as the study eye for intervention; the better-seeing contralateral eye served as an untreated control for intraindividual natural history and performance variability.
