<p id="p0045">Human embryonic stem cell-derived RPE cells were delivered into a preselected transition region of the retina, defined for each participant as a region extending from an area of relatively preserved structural integrity and function to an area of atrophic nonfunctional retina. The rationale was to investigate the safety of hESC-derived RPE cell administration in areas of relatively well-preserved retina and the potential benefit in areas of retinal dysfunction and atrophy. The target region was defined before surgery for the study eye of each participant with regard to the distribution of the disease severity and preferred locus of fixation using spectral-domain (SD) OCT, fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging, and microperimetry. We defined target regions close to the preferred locus of fixation to optimize the quality of structural and functional assessment.</p>
