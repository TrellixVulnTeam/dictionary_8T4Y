<p id="p0035">Retinal pigment epithelial cells were generated from the hESC line MA09 in accordance with good manufacturing practice. The hESC bank was thawed and expanded on mitomycin Câ€“treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts for 3 passages. Human embryonic stem cells were dissociated and seeded to allow embryoid body formation. Pigmented RPE patches then were isolated with collagenase from cellular outgrowths. After purification and trypsinization, the RPE cells were expanded and cryopreserved at passage 2 for clinical application. We characterized RPE cells in process and after freezing and formulation, including karyotyping, pathogen and phagocytosis assay testing, and differentiation and purity evaluation by morphologic assessment, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and quantitative immunohistochemistry for RPE and hESC markers. On the day of transplantation, cells were thawed from cryopreserved hESC-derived RPE cell banks, formulated at the appropriate concentration, stained to exclude bacterial contamination, and delivered to the operating room for administration.
