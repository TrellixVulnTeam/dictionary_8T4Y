<p id="p0050">To manage the risk of immune rejection of the transplanted hESC-derived RPE cells, participants were prescribed oral immunosuppression in the perioperative period. Low-dose tacrolimus (0.1 mg/kg) was divided into 2 daily doses from 1 week before transplantation, titrated to achieve trough serum levels of 3 to 7 ng/ml, and maintained until week 6 after transplantation, when it was discontinued. Mycophenolate was commenced on the day of surgery (day 0) in an escalating dose regimen: 0.25 g twice daily (day 0 to day 1); 0.5 g twice daily (day 2 to day 3), and 1 g twice daily from day 4 until 12 weeks after transplantation, when it was discontinued. Participants also were prescribed a standard postvitrectomy regimen of topical antibiotics (chloramphenicol 0.5% 4 times daily for 7 days) and topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ketorolac 0.5% 4 times daily for 4 weeks).</p>
