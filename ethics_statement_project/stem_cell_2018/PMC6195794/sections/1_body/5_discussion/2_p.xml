<p id="p0130">The development of subretinal hyperpigmentation within the injected area in all 12 participants was dose dependent and associated in many instances with a hyperreflective signal on OCT, suggesting survival of injected donor hESC-derived RPE cells. The high density of pigmentation in these areas may reflect a greater melanin content, higher density, hypertrophy,

We found no definitive evidence of local accumulation of lipofuscin on FAF imaging to demonstrate physiologic activity, and hence viability, of the cells, although FAF may take longer than 12 months to develop. Preferential engraftment of RPE cell transplants to areas devoid of host RPE is plausible given the anchorage-dependent properties of RPE cells

 </xref> The progressive local extension of hyperpigmentation during the first 3 months and the predilection for areas of atrophy in the recipient retina are consistent with local migration of surviving donor cells, but may reflect subretinal migration of released pigment.
