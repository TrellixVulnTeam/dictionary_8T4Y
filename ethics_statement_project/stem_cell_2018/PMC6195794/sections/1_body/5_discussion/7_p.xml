<p id="p0155">The evidence of safety broadly supports the rationale for further studies to explore the impact of intervention at an earlier stage of degeneration when surviving photoreceptors cells may stand to benefit with improved function and survival. However, instances of focally reduced sensitivity and thinning in hyperpigmented retina at higher doses of hESC-derived RPE cells suggest the potential for harm and indicate that intervention at earlier stages of degeneration should be approached with caution.</p>
