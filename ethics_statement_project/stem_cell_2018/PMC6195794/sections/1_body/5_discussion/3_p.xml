<p id="p0135">To mitigate the risk of immune rejection of injected allogenic hESC-derived RPE cells, we administered systemic immunosuppressive medications to all participants for 13 weeks. We identified no overt clinical signs to suggest acute or delayed rejection. Specifically, we noted no vitreitis, retinal exudation or retinitis, vascular leakage, choroiditis, or cystoid macular edema, although features of rejection may not always be readily evident.

 </xref> We identified no change on clinical examination or imaging after withdrawal of immunosuppression, 12 weeks after the injection procedure. A reduction in the pigmentation density at the site of transplantation, evident in 2 participants (at month 6 in patient 9 and at month 12 in patient 4) may reflect rejection of pigmented donor hESC-derived RPE cells, although no associated change in retinal function was apparent. The risk of immune rejection may be reduced by use of autologous RPE cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, although such cells nonetheless may be subject to rejection, and the process of cell derivation specific to an individual presents considerable logistical challenges.
