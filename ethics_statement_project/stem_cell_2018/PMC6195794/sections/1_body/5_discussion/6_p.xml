<p id="p0150">We also sought to determine whether the function of photoreceptor cells that are surviving but compromised may improve after the provision of healthy supporting RPE cells. In a previous trial of up to 150 000 hESC-derived RPE cells in STGD1, variable improvements in VA were measured in 3 of 8 eyes without secondary cataract, although the mean difference in VA between the recipient and contralateral eyes was not statistically significant.

 </xref> In the present trial, we administered up to 200 000 hESC-derived RPE cells and measured retinal structure and function in detail using microperimetry and SD OCT. Our findings demonstrate the value of detailed analysis of spatial correlation of retinal structure and function in determining with appropriate sensitivity the impact of cell transplantation. We found no significant benefit to retinal function at 12 months in the 12 participants. Although RPE cell transplantation theoretically may improve the function of overlying photoreceptor cells, the potential for improvement is limited in this particular population of participants by the severity of established retinal degeneration.
