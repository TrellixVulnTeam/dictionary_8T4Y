<p id="p0145">The aim of intervention is to protect or improve aspects of sight. In the current trial, all participants showed advanced disease before intervention, with established retinal degeneration and severe impairment of visual function. We measured no consistent progression of disease during the 12-month trial; deterioration in the visual fields of both eyes of 2 participants (patients 2 and 4) was apparent on full-field perimetry, but was not evident on microperimetry. Given the slow rate of progressive degeneration at this advanced stage of disease, any protection against further deterioration may be evident only after a more extended period of observation.</p>
