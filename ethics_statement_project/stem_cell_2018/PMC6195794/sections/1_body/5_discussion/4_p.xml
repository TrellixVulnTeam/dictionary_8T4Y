 </xref> In our study, intraocular administration of carefully obtained hESC-derived RPE cells resulted in the development of pigmented foci in the vitreous cavity in 2 participants and on the surface of the inner retina in 2 participants, suggesting reflux of donor hESC-derived RPE cells from the subretinal compartment into the vitreous cavity. Despite the presence of preretinal or intravitreal pigmentation, no associated adverse effect was evident.
