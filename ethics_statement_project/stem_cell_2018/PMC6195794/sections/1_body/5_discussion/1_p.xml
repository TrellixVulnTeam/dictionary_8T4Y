 </xref> Repair of the compromised or degenerate RPE by transplantation of healthy RPE cells offers the possibility of protecting or improving sight by supporting the function or survival of overlying photoreceptor cells. The results of the trial satisfied its primary end point for safety, with no evidence of inflammatory responses or uncontrolled intraocular or systemic proliferation, after subretinal administration of up to 200â€‰000 hESC-derived RPE cells. There were no serious adverse events related to the surgical procedure; intraoperative adverse events resulted in no harm to visual function beyond the immediate postoperative period. A brief decline in BCVA in the operated eye after administration of hESC-derived RPE cells was a predictable temporary consequence of intraocular surgery. The development of pigmented epiretinal membranes after injection of hESC-derived RPE cells has been reported previously

 </xref> and is consistent with reflux of cell suspension from the subretinal space. Although we measured no associated adverse impact on visual function at 12 months, the longer-term significance has yet to be determined. Adverse events related to the immunosuppressive medications occurred during the period of their administration, but had no impact subsequently.
