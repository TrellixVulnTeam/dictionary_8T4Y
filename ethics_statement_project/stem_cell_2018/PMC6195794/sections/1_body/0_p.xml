<p id="p0010">Embryonic stem cells are a potentially valuable source of donor cells for therapeutic repair and regeneration. Their pluripotency and innate capacity for self-renewal offer a virtually unlimited supply of highly specialized cells for therapeutic transplantation, but also present a potential risk of harm from uncontrolled proliferation and unintended differentiation. Their impact in experimental models has been investigated extensively, but evidence of their safety and potential efficacy in humans is limited. Embryonic stem cells have attracted attention for their potential value in a broad range of degenerative conditions, including those affecting the brain and eye. The eye has unique advantages as a target organ for cell transplantation. The retina is an extension of the brain that is readily accessible to surgical intervention under direct observation; its laminar structure lends itself to the targeted delivery of cellular therapies. TheÂ highly compartmentalized structure of the globe restricts potential dissemination locally and systemically. The intraocular environment is relatively protected against systemic immune responses that threaten allograft survival. Retinal microstructure can be observed in detail in the living eye noninvasively owing to the optical transparency of ocular media, and retinal function can be mapped topographically with exquisite sensitivity. The impact of intervention within a defined target region of the retina can be determined with confidence by comparison with untreated regions within the same eye and in the contralateral eye, which offer invaluable intraocular and intraindividual controls for the natural history of the condition and variability in performance.</p>
