The impact of early-onset cardiotoxicity on treatment outcomes is less well understood. Thus, we evaluated the risk factors for incident early cardiotoxicity and the impacts of cardiotoxicity on event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS).<h4>Methods</h4>Cardiotoxicity was ascertained through adverse event monitoring over the course of follow-up among 1,022 pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia treated in the Children's Oncology Group trial AAML0531. It was defined as grade 2 or higher left ventricular systolic dysfunction on the basis of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3) definitions.<h4>Results</h4>Approximately 12% of patients experienced cardiotoxicity over a 5-year follow-up, with more than 70% of incident events occurring during on-protocol therapy. Documented cardiotoxicity during on-protocol therapy was significantly associated with subsequent off-protocol toxicity. Overall, the incidence was higher among noninfants and black patients, and in the setting of a bloodstream infection. Both EFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.1; P = .004) and OS (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.2, P = .005) were significantly worse in patients with documented cardiotoxicity. Impacts on EFS were equivalent whether the incident cardiotoxicity event occurred in the absence (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.2; P = .017) or presence of infection (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.7; P = .069) compared with patients without documented cardiotoxicity. However, the reduction in OS was more pronounced for cardiotoxicity not associated with infection (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.5; P = .004) than for infection-associated cardiotoxicity (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.7 to 2.4; P = .387).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Early treatment-related cardiotoxicity may be associated with decreased EFS and OS.
