  <p>Clinical parameters and γδ T cell numbers in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients receiving DAA therapy. Graphs represent 
   <bold>(A)</bold> HCV RNA levels in IU/mL and 
   <bold>(B)</bold> alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in IU/mL, statistical analysis for both parameters with Wilcoxon test, as well as 
   <bold>(C)</bold> fibroscan values in kPa, statistical analysis with paired 
   <italic>t</italic>-test. 
   <bold>(A–C)</bold> Median values with interquartile range from 10 chronic HCV patients before, during, and after DAA therapy are summarized. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Absolute lymphocyte counts were assessed for 10 chronic HCV patients at given time points. 
   <bold>(E–G)</bold> The number of total 
   <bold>(E)</bold>, Vγ9
   <sup>+</sup>
   <bold>(F)</bold>, or Vγ9
   <sup>−</sup>
   <bold>(G)</bold> γδ T cells per μL blood were determined from FACS data and lymphocyte counts shown for each of the 10 HCV patients individually. Gray shaded areas highlight the 8 weeks of DAA treatment. The number of total 
   <bold>(E)</bold>, Vγ9
   <sup>+</sup>
   <bold>(F)</bold>, or Vγ9
   <sup>−</sup>
   <bold>(G)</bold> γδ T cells per μL blood were separated based on the ALT levels (red shows patients who have ALT levels &gt;2 times ULON, blue indicates patients who have ALT levels &lt;2 times ULON). Gray shaded areas highlight the 8-week DAA treatment.
