<p>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of TCR repertoires has the advantage to monitor γδ T cell populations at the clonal level and to identify disease-related TRG (γ-chain) and TRD (δ-chain) sequences (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). To understand the clonal distribution of γδ T cells in patients with chronic HCV and to investigate in the influence of DAA on γδ T cell repertoires, we used flow cytometric cell sorting and NGS to profile γδ TCRs from total as well as Vγ9
 <sup>+</sup> and Vγ9
 <sup>−</sup> isolated γδ T cell populations from peripheral blood.
