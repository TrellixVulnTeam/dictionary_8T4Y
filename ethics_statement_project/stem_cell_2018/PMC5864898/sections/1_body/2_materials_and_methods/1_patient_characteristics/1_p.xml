<p>All 23 patients chronically infected with HCV as well as 9 HC were recruited at the Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology at Hannover Medical School, Germany. In addition, five HC were recruited at the Institute of Immunology/Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation at Hannover Medical School, Germany. The chronic HCV patients were analyzed over time before, during, and after novel DAA therapy for 8 weeks with a combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir. From 10 patients, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected at treatment start (TS), therapy week 1 (w1), therapy week 4 (w4), follow-up week 12 (fu12), and 1 year after treatment cessation (fu48), isolated and cryopreserved for deferred analysis. Further, 13 chronic HCV patients who were treated for 8 or 12 weeks with a combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir were included in the study with only one time-point during or after treatment to determine their TRD repertoires.</p>
