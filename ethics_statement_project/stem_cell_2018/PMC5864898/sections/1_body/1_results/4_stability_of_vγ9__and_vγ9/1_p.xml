<p>Finally, we asked whether chronic HCV infection and DAA-driven viral clearance would affect γδ T cell repertoires, which otherwise stay relatively stable over time (

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). For this, we analyzed γδ TCR repertoires at TS, during DAA treatment and up to 1 year after therapy (illustrated in Figure S1A in Supplementary Material). We studied the TRD repertoires of sorted Vγ9
 <sup>+</sup> or Vγ9
 <sup>−</sup> cells as well as TRG and TRD repertoires of total γδ T cells. First, no significant changes in median frequencies of the top 20 clones and Shannon diversity indices of the analyzed cell subsets reflected that γδ TCR repertoires retained the overall complexity during the course of DAA drug therapy (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A,B; Figures S3A,B in Supplementary Material). Plotting the most expanded 20 TRD clones of either Vγ9
 <sup>+</sup> or Vγ9
 <sup>−</sup> sorted cells (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C) and the top 20 TRG and TRD clones of total γδ T cells (Figure S3C in Supplementary Material) over time, it turned out that only one patient (patient 3) showed notable changes in the distribution of expanded clones after TS. Importantly, this instability was caused by changes in Vδ2
 <sup>+</sup> sequences of Vγ9
 <sup>+</sup> sorted cells (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C). These might have been associated with increased γδ T cell counts starting from w1, but no other clinical parameters. Furthermore, γδTCR repertoire stability can be described in similarities between two given time points as calculated by Morisita–Horn indices. Notably, the Morisita–Horn index considers all clones of the given repertoire, while zero means no overlap and one represents complete overlap between all clones of given samples. Median values of calculated Morisita–Horn similarity indices revealed only minor changes of γδ T cell repertoires before, during, and after DAA drug therapy (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D; Figure S3D in Supplementary Material). In summary, γδ TCR repertoires of total, Vγ9
 <sup>+</sup> or Vγ9
 <sup>−</sup> γδ T cells retained their overall complexity during DAA therapy and were highly stable up to 1 year after viral clearance and normalization of liver enzymes.
