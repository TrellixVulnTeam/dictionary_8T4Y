<p>Next, we investigated Vγ9
 <sup>+</sup> and Vγ9
 <sup>−</sup> cells separately. Flow cytometric profiling of γδ T cells specified a fraction of Vγ9
 <sup>−</sup>Vδ2
 <sup>+</sup> cells in the peripheral blood of adults and chronic HCV patients (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A), which is in line with the identification of expanded Vγ9
 <sup>−</sup>Vδ2
 <sup>+</sup> clones in HC and transplant recipients (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In adults, TRD repertoires are highly individual, while all TRG repertoires comprise public Vγ9JP rearrangements shared between all persons (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Here, we analyzed TRD repertoires of sorted Vγ9
 <sup>+</sup> and Vγ9
 <sup>−</sup> γδ T cells from 11 HC and 20 chronic HCV patients receiving DAA therapy (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>; Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). First, we studied the distribution of δ-chains within the Vγ9
 <sup>+</sup> and Vγ9
 <sup>−</sup> subsets in HC and chronic HCV patients. As depicted by boxplots (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B,C), Vγ9
 <sup>+</sup> cells paired mainly with Vδ2
 <sup>+</sup> sequences, while Vγ9
 <sup>−</sup> cells paired with Vδ1, Vδ2, and Vδ3 sequences. In addition, the proportion of Vγ9
 <sup>−</sup>Vδ3
 <sup>+</sup> cells was on average slightly increased in chronic HCV patients when compared with HC (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C) and could be associated with the identification of some expanded Vγ9
 <sup>−</sup>Vδ3
 <sup>+</sup> clones (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D). Next, we analyzed the clonal distribution of the 20 most expanded TRD clones of Vγ9
 <sup>+</sup> and Vγ9
 <sup>−</sup> sorted cells from three representative HC (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>E) and three chronic HCV patients (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>F). Similar to total γδ T cell populations, TRD repertoires of Vγ9
 <sup>+</sup> and Vγ9
 <sup>−</sup> cell subsets were diverse and depicted an oligoclonal expansion of particular Vγ9
 <sup>+</sup>Vδ2
 <sup>+</sup>, Vγ9
 <sup>−</sup>Vδ2
 <sup>−</sup>, and Vγ9
 <sup>−</sup>Vδ2
 <sup>+</sup> clones (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>E,F). Comparison of the combined median frequency of the top 20 Vγ9
 <sup>+</sup> and Vγ9
 <sup>−</sup> TRD clones between HC and chronic HCV patients pointed to lower frequencies of top 20 clones in Vγ9
 <sup>+</sup> cells of the HC group (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>G). However, individual TRD repertoires were very diverse in the analyzed groups and thus differences in top 20 frequencies (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>G) and TRD repertoire diversities as measured by Shannon indices (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>H) were not statistically significant. Still, separate analyses of Vγ9
 <sup>+</sup> and Vγ9
 <sup>−</sup> sorted γδ T cells revealed that Vγ9
 <sup>−</sup> TRD repertoires displayed a high Vδ-chain diversity and that expanded Vγ9
 <sup>−</sup>Vδ3
 <sup>+</sup> clones existed in some chronic HCV patients, while the overall clonal composition of Vγ9
 <sup>+</sup> and Vγ9
 <sup>−</sup> TRD repertoires was comparable between healthy persons and chronic HCV patients. Further studies, preferably also including patients with more severe HCV disease, will be required to support or refute the hypothesis that Vγ9
 <sup>−</sup>Vδ3
 <sup>+</sup> clones selectively expand in response to HCV infection.
