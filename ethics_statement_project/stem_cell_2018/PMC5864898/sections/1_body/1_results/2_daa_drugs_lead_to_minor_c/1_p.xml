<p>Next, we investigated the effect of DAA-induced viral clearance on peripheral γδ T cell lymphocytes. Patients were treated for 8 weeks with a combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir. All patients achieved a sustained virological response (Figure S1A in Supplementary Material). Six of ten patients were virus-negative at therapy week 4 (w4); HCV RNA levels of the other four patients were already very low at this time point (&lt;20 IU/mL) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). Some patients had mild liver fibrosis indicated by fibroscan values ranging from 5.4 to 12.3 kPa, which decreased significantly from therapy start (TS) to follow-up week 12 (fu12) (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>; Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). Some parameters for liver inflammation, such as ALT and AST levels, were slightly increased at TS (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>; Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C), while bilirubin values were ranging in the normal level below 17 µmol/L (3.0–14.0 µmol/L) (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). During DAA therapy, ALT levels decreased significantly within the first therapy week and reached normal levels at week 4 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C). After initiation of DAA therapy, a slight increase of absolute lymphocyte numbers and γδ T cells/μL blood was observed (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D,E), which declined then until follow-up week 12 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D). Furthermore, small changes in the number of Vγ9
 <sup>+</sup> and Vγ9
 <sup>−</sup> γδ T cells/μL blood were detected during the first therapy weeks while staying stable during the follow-up year (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>F,G). Of note, patients with ALT values higher than twofold ULON had very low numbers of Vγ9
 <sup>−</sup> γδ T cells/μL blood (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>G), whereas the number of Vγ9
 <sup>+</sup> γδ T cells/μL blood and their progression was similar to patients with ALT values lower than twofold ULON (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>F). Altogether, patients improved with regard to liver inflammation and stiffness following successful eradication of HCV infection, while total numbers of Vγ9
 <sup>+</sup> and Vγ9
 <sup>−</sup> γδ T cells remained highly stable after viral clearance. This suggests that potential alterations in γδ T cell numbers and repertoire composition in response to HCV infection were sustained for the observation period of 48 weeks.
