<p>The ProCID study will also evaluate whether different maintenance doses of IVIg may result in changes in treatment response in patients with definite or probable CIDP, and whether this efficacy will differ compared with that observed in the ICE

While maintenance doses of IVIg vary considerably, most patients start with a standard maintenance dose of 1 g/kg every 3 weeks (or equivalent), with subsequent dose adjustments being made as needed. This study will evaluate whether a higher or lower starting dose to the maintenance phase is better than the widely used standard dose of 1 g/kg every 3 weeks and will assess the safety and tolerability of these additional doses to provide clinicians further data in choosing IVIg maintenance doses for patients with CIDP.
