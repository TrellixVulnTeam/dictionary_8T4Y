<p>The only other randomised‐controlled study to have prospectively evaluated the efficacy of different IVIg doses observed a dose‐response relationship following a single dose of IVIg 0.25, 1.0 or 2.0 g/kg over 5 days.
 <xref rid="jns12267-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> Among 60 patients with CIDP or multi‐focal motor neuropathy who received treatment, high‐dose IVIg therapy (2.0 g/kg) was associated with a higher initial response rate compared with the 0.25 and 1.0 g/kg doses (response rates of 60% vs 15% and 21%, respectively) at 5 weeks; 24‐week data were not presented in this study.

 <xref rid="jns12267-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> Although the difference in relapse rates between SCIg doses was not significant, relapse rates with both SCIg doses were significantly lower than with placebo (56%;
