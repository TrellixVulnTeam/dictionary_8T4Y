<p>The ProCID study is a randomised, multi‐centre, phase III trial of IVIg in patients with CIDP that will compare the efficacy and safety of 3 different maintenance doses (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g/kg) of IVIg (panzyga) administered every 3 weeks over 24 weeks, following an induction dose of 2 g/kg. Data from the ProCID study will provide important new information on the best maintenance dose of IVIg to use when treating patients with CIDP. Here, we report the design and protocol of the ProCID study.</p>
