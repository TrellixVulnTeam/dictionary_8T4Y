<p>Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is an acquired peripheral neuropathy, for which first‐line therapy options include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), corticosteroids, and plasma exchange.
 <xref rid="jns12267-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> The degree of treatment response to immunoglobulin differs between patients with CIDP, and the time to and duration of maximum effect can vary from weeks to months.
 <xref rid="jns12267-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> In the IVIg in CIDP Efficacy (ICE) study of 117 patients with CIDP, maintenance treatment with IVIg 1 g/kg every 3 weeks over 24 weeks was shown to be effective
 <xref rid="jns12267-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>; however, the European Federation of Neurological Sciences (EFNS)/Peripheral Nerve Society (PNS) 2010 guidelines recommend that the appropriate IVIg maintenance dose and frequency needs to be individualised based on the patient's treatment response, typically at 0.4 to 1.2 g/kg every 2 to 6 weeks.
