<p>Patients who do not experience deterioration of CIDP during the 12‐week washout phase (ie, those with inactive disease during the 12 weeks) will not continue in the study. During the study, the investigator may decide to withdraw patients in cases of adverse events (AEs), poor compliance, withdrawal of patient consent, pregnancy, risk of severe harm due to continued study treatment or protocol procedures, disease development that interferes with study treatment or meets an exclusion criterion, or administration of an immunoglobulin product other than panzyga. Additional patients will be enrolled when the proportion of patients who withdraw exceeds 10% (unless the planned number of patients in the dose group has already been achieved). Replacement patients will be assigned to the same dose group as the withdrawn patients; however, patients who withdraw from the study because of safety issues will not be replaced.</p>
