<p>The following secondary efficacy endpoints will also be assessed: proportion of patients in the IVIg 0.5 and 2.0 g/kg groups vs the IVIg 1.0 g/kg group with response to treatment at week 24 based on the adjusted INCAT disability score, grip strength (assessed by Martin Handheld Vigorimeter, Gebrüder Martin GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Tuttlingen, Germany) using the MCID cut‐off of 8 kPa, and I‐RODS score using the MCID‐SE cut‐off of −1.96 or less
 <xref rid="jns12267-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>; the time to first confirmed worsening (ie, increase from baseline by ≥1 point) in the adjusted INCAT disability score; the time to improvement (ie, 1 point decrease from baseline) in adjusted INCAT disability score; the time to first confirmed worsening from baseline in I‐RODS score; the time to decrease in I‐RODS score; mean change from baseline to end‐of‐study assessment visit in grip strength of both hands, I‐RODS score, Pain Intensity Numeric Rating Scale (PI‐NRS), and sum of the distal evoked amplitude of 4 right‐sided and 4 left‐sided motor nerves (peroneal, tibial, ulnar, and median); and the absolute number of improvers in grip strength and I‐RODS during the study.
