<p>The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients in the IVIg 1.0 g/kg group with response to treatment at week 24 (defined as a decrease in adjusted INCAT disability score of â‰¥1 point). The adjusted INCAT disability score differs from the standard score by exclusion of changes in upper limb function from 0 (normal) to 1 (minor symptoms) or from 1 to 0, as these changes are not considered to be clinically relevant in all patients.
