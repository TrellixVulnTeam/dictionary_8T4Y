<p>All patients who worsen in the washout phase will receive an initial loading dose of IVIg 2.0 g/kg. Patients will then be centrally randomised to maintenance treatment using an interactive web response system and stratified by previous immunoglobulin or corticosteroid treatment using a stratified block design. Patients will be assigned in a 1:2:1 ratio to receive double‐blind maintenance IVIg (panzyga) doses of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 g/kg, respectively, administered every 3 weeks (±4 days) for 24 weeks (dose‐evaluation phase).</p>
