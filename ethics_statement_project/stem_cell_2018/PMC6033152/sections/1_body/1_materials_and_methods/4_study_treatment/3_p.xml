<p>To maintain blinding during the dose‚Äêevaluation phase, all patients will receive the same infusion volume as in the 2.0 g/kg treatment arm, using saline solution to match the volume in the 0.5 and 1.0 g/kg treatment arms. Each infusion will be administered over 2 consecutive days, and the content of each infusion bag will be concealed with an overpouch (normally used for light protection) and new identical labels on both IVIg and saline bags. The IVIg and saline solutions will not be mixed prior to administration (ie, no dilution of IVIg will occur).</p>
