<p>The statistical analysis will consider the safety set (SAF), full analysis set (FAS), and per‚Äêprotocol set (PPS) patient populations (Table 
 <xref rid="jns12267-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The primary endpoint analysis will be conducted for the FAS and PPS, the secondary endpoints will be evaluated in the FAS and in the PPS (in case the 2 populations differ by &gt;5%), and the safety analysis will be conducted in the SAF. All efficacy and safety analyses will be summarised using descriptive statistics.
