<p>Calculation of the sample size is based on the proportion of patients with treatment response in the IVIg 1.0 g/kg group. Based on previous trials,
 <xref rid="jns12267-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="jns12267-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> a threshold of 42% responders was chosen for the evaluation of the primary endpoint. To achieve a power of â‰¥80%, a minimum of 62 evaluable patients in the IVIg 1.0 g/kg group is needed. Therefore, the study plans to enrol 70 patients in this group to account for possible dropouts. For the comparison between doses, half of the eligible patients will be enrolled in the standard dose group (1.0 g/kg) and the other half in the lower (0.5 g/kg) and higher (2.0 g/kg) dose groups. The total target enrolment is 140 patients.
