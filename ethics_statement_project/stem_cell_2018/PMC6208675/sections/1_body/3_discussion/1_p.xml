<p id="Par18">The findings from this analysis of PRO data from the Connect MM patient registry showed no deterioration in HRQoL, despite continued active therapy in the maintenance therapy groups. Patient-reported HRQoL using the FACT-MM, EQ-5D Index, and BPI improved after transplant in all three groups and numerically deteriorated on progression. Deterioration of HRQoL scores was significant when assessed with the FACT-MM total score and specific subscales (TOI and MM-Scale). Interestingly, HRQoL was measured before patients being informed of disease progression; thus, HRQoL deterioration was observed independently. A trend towards greater improvement in HRQoL was observed in the groups receiving any maintenance therapy and lenalidomide-only maintenance therapy, as compared with the group receiving no maintenance therapy. Results were consistent across all HRQoL measures.</p>
