<p id="Par22">In conclusion, these results show that post-ASCT maintenance therapy, including lenalidomide-only maintenance therapy, did not negatively affect HRQoL in patients in the Connect MM Registry. Patients had generally similar scores on measures assessing overall HRQoL, myeloma-specific concerns, pain severity, and health utilities, regardless of maintenance or no maintenance therapy after ASCT. These findings suggest that continued, active, post-ASCT maintenance therapy does not decrease HRQoL while improving clinical outcomes, thus supporting a favorable benefitâ€“risk profile. Confirmation of these outcomes with a longer follow-up and in the Connect MM registry Cohort 2 is warranted.</p>
