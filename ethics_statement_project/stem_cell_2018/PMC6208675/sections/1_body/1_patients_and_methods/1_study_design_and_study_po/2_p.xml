<p id="Par7">The registry comprises two cohorts: Cohort 1 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1493) includes patients enrolled from September 2009 to December 2011, and Cohort 2 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1518) includes patients enrolled from December 2012 to April 2016. Using available site screening information, 92% of all screened patients were enrolled. Patients were followed for treatment and outcomes for as many as 8 years or until discontinuation from the study. The analysis population for the present study comprised Cohort 1 patients who completed induction therapy and first-line ASCT and had or had not received maintenance therapy post-ASCT (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). To reduce potential sources of bias, patients who received allogeneic, tandem, or unknown types of transplant were excluded. Also, patients who received consolidation (defined as treatment received for &lt; 60 days following transplant) before maintenance therapy were excluded from this analysis. The analysis population was categorized into three groups: (1) any type of maintenance therapy, including lenalidomide-only; (2) lenalidomide-only maintenance therapy; or (3) no maintenance therapy.
