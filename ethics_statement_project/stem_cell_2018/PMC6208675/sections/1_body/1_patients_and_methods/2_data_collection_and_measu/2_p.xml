<p id="Par9">The FACT-MM questionnaire consists of the four core FACT HRQoL subscales measuring physical, functional, social, and emotional well-being (FACT-G; 27 items) and an additional subscale (MM subscale) measuring MM-specific concerns (14 items). Following standard FACT instructions, items were rated using a 0- to 4-point scale based on the past 7 days, with higher scores indicating better HRQoL and fewer MM-related symptoms. Three scores were calculated for analysis: the FACT-MM total score (all domains; scale, 0–164), the trial outcome index (TOI; physical, functional, and MM-specific domains; scale, 0–112), and an MM subscale score (scale, 0–56). The EQ-5D is a general, nondisease measure of health utilities and assesses five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Summary assessments for EQ-5D use the visual analog scale and an index score (scale, − 0.109 to 1), with higher scores indicating better health states. The BPI short form assesses the existence and intensity of pain on a scale of 0 to 10 (none to worst) and categorizes pain as mild (1–4), moderate (5–6), and severe (7–10).</p>
