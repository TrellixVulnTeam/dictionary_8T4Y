<p id="Par3">Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is a standard of care for eligible patients with newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Despite improvements in treatment, ASCT is not curative for most patients, with more than half of patients relapsing within 2 to 3 years after ASCT if they did not receive post-ASCT treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, a key treatment goal for transplant-eligible patients with NDMM is to extend post-ASCT remission. Results of analyses examining survival outcomes and tolerability associated with interferon, corticosteroid, and thalidomide maintenance therapy have been inconsistent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Bortezomib maintenance has also been tested, with increased progression-free survival (PFS) noted [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].
