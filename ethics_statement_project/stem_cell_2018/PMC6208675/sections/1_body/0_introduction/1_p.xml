<p id="Par2">Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematologic malignancy of plasma cells that has an age-adjusted incidence of 6.5 per 100,000 persons per year in the USA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In 2017, an estimated 30,280 living in the USA will be diagnosed with MM, and 12,590 will die of the disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although the rates of new MM diagnoses have been increasing at an average of 0.8% per year during the past decade, advances in the development of anti-myeloma therapies have expanded treatment options and resulted in a parallel decrease of death rates by an average of 0.8% per year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, despite the introduction of novel therapies, MM continues to be incurable and patients ultimately relapse.
