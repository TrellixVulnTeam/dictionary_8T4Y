<p id="Par14">Median follow-up time was 39.3 months (range, 0.0–87.1 months) at the time of data cutoff (July 2016). The median duration of maintenance treatment was 23.5 months (range, 0.6–69.6 months) in the group receiving any maintenance therapy and 24.9 months (range, 0.6–69.6 months) in the group receiving lenalidomide-only maintenance therapy (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). During the analysis period, the completion rate for the FACT-MM was higher in the non-maintenance group (odds ratio 1.4; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>); results were similar for the other tools. Increased completion rates may be due to closer follow-up and thus more frequent clinic visits in patients not receiving maintenance. However, among high completers (&gt; 75% of forms) and low completers (&lt; 25% of expected forms), there were no differences in baseline characteristics (e.g. age, race, sex, disease stage, performance status, renal insufficiency); slight differences in completion were seen between academic and community settings (data not shown). Mean analysis baseline scores for the EQ-5D, FACT-MM (total, TOI, and MM subscale), and BPI were similar across groups (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
