<p id="Par13">Between September 2009 and December 2011, 1493 patients had enrolled in Cohort 1 of the Connect MM registry from community (81%), academic (18%), or government (1%) centers. The mean time from initial diagnosis to enrollment in this registry was 25 days. Of the 1493 patients enrolled, 548 patients received ASCT; of these, 244 met the analysis criteria for any maintenance, 169 for lenalidomide-only maintenance, and 137 for no maintenance (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). At study entry, the median age was 60 years (range, 24–78 years), 61% were men, and 85% were white. Most patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 (64%) and were International Staging System stage I or II (57%). A higher percentage of patients in the groups receiving maintenance therapy had received triplet therapy as induction therapy (63 and 65% for any maintenance or lenalidomide-only maintenance therapies, respectively), compared with the group receiving no maintenance therapy (50%). Table 6 (Online Resource 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) provides the breakdown of types of maintenance therapies administered in the group receiving any maintenance therapy.
