<p id="Par15">No statistically significant differences in change from pre-ASCT baseline values were observed between the groups receiving any maintenance therapy and lenalidomide-only maintenance therapy versus the group receiving no maintenance therapy for the FACT-MM total score (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, b), TOI score (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, b), and myeloma subscale score (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, b; Table 7 [Online Resource 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>]). Across the treatment groups, FACT-MM total score, TOI score, and MM subscale score increased significantly from pre-ASCT to the follow-up period (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 for all groups) and decreased significantly at progression (
 <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.01, all groups; Figs.
