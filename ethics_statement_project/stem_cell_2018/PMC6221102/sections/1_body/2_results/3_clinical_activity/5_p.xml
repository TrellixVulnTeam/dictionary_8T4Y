<p>In patients with AML vs. MDS, the estimated median OS (80% CI) was 16.3 (13.4‐19.4) months vs. 13.0 (11.0‐15.6) months (Supporting Information 
 <xref rid="ajh25238-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S5</xref>). In patients with AML who were aged ≥55 years, median OS (80% CI) was 14.7 (13.1‐19.3) months. Although patient numbers were small, OS in patients aged ≥55 years, as well as in patients aged &gt;60 years, compared favorably with estimated OS according to ELN risk criteria
 <sup>32</sup>: median OS (80% CI) in patients with AML aged ≥55 years was NE (NE‐NE) in those with favorable risk, 19.3 (13.1‐NE) months in those with intermediate‐I risk, 13.4 (9.0‐14.7) months in those with intermediate‐II risk and 8.5 (5.8‐12.3) months in patients categorized with adverse risk (Table
