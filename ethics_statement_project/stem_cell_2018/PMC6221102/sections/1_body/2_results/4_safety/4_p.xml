<p>Over the course of the study, 41 (59.4%) deaths were reported; 5 (7.2%) treatment‐emergent deaths occurred within 28 days of the last dose: disease progression (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2) and sepsis, pneumonia and septic shock (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1 each). One case of sepsis was considered by the investigator to be treatment‐related to combination glasdegib plus cytarabine/daunorubicin. One (1.4%) and four (5.8%) patients (all aged ≥55 years) died ≤30 and ≤60 days, respectively, from the first dose of study treatments. No patients with CR died while on active treatment. Thirty‐six (52.2%) deaths occurred during the follow‐up period (&gt;28 days after the last dose); the main cause among all 69 patients was progression of the disease under study (
 <italic>n</italic> = 30; 43.5%).
