<p>AEs of special interests for glasdegib, including muscle spasms, dysgeusia, alopecia, acute kidney injury, or electrocardiogram prolonged QTc, were nonserious; the majority were grades 1 or 2, except for one case of serious acute kidney injury that was considered not treatment‐related. The grade 3 acute kidney injury (creatinine 2.47 mg/dL) occurred after a hypotensive episode that resolved without intervention and was considered to be related to analgesics and dehydration. On the same day, the patient was diagnosed with grade 3 acute myocardial infarction (MI); thus, the investigator considered the acute kidney injury to be related to the non‐ST‐elevation MI event together with severe hypotension. Muscle spasms led to permanent discontinuation of glasdegib in one patient. No clinically significant glasdegib‐related QTc prolongation was observed.</p>
