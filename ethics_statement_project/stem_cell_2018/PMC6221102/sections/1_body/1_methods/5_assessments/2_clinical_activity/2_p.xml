<p>Efficacy endpoints were based on investigator assessment, using the modified International Working Group criteria.

 <xref rid="ajh25238-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref> Bone marrow evaluations were performed on day 21 of induction cycle 1, and thereafter at the investigator's discretion prior to the next cycle of chemotherapy. If a second cycle of induction therapy was required, a bone marrow evaluation was performed on day 21 of induction cycle 2. Patients underwent bone marrow evaluations on day 21 of the consolidation final cycle, day 1 of maintenance cycles 3 and 6. A bone marrow aspirate was required at end of treatment regardless of when the patient discontinued the trial, unless the end of treatment was within 14 days of a prior evaluation. All aspirate collections were mandatory unless deemed inappropriate by the investigator and agreed by the sponsor. For the purposes of calculating response duration, bone marrow collection dates were used as the start/stop dates. Patients still in CR/CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi)/morphologic leukemia‐free state (MLFS) at the most recent bone marrow assessment were censored at the end of treatment.
