<p>The planned sample size was approximately 70 patients. The focus of the primary analysis was patients aged ≥55 years, with 60 patients ≥55 years old providing ≥82% power to reject the null hypothesis of CR rate of 54% (cytarabine/daunorubicin alone) if the true CR rate of the combination with glasdegib is 68%. This allowed a one‐sided type I error rate of 10% under a binomial distribution and one futility analysis at 2 months after the enrollment of the 30th patient. Up to 10 patients &lt;55 years old were to be enrolled for exploratory purposes.</p>
