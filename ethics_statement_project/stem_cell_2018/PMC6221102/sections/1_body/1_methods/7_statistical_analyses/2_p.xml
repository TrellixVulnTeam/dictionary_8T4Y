<p>The primary endpoint analyses for this study were based on patients who were ≥55 years old. The primary endpoint was CR, with the final analysis timing defined as deaths in at least 40 of 60 patients ≥55 years old. However, due to a lower than anticipated death rate, a decision was made to declare the primary completion date and data cut‐off date as January 3, 2017, wherein 38 deaths were reported.</p>
