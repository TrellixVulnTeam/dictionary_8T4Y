<p>Study treatment continued until the patient withdrew consent, developed unacceptable toxicity, or demonstrated either resistant disease during induction or disease progression/relapse after induction. Patients could proceed to allogeneic stem cell transplant; those who did were removed from study treatment and followed for survival. The 100 mg glasdegib daily dose could be temporarily interrupted or reduced to 50 mg to manage toxicity. After cycle 1, if a toxicity was attributed to the backbone chemotherapy and not to glasdegib, chemotherapeutics could be delayed or reduced, with continuation of glasdegib. If a patient had a dose reduction for a study drug‐related toxicity, the dose was not to be re‐escalated.</p>
