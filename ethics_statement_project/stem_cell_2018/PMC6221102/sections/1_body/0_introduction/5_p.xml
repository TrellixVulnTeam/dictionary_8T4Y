<p>In an open‐label, phase 1 study (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>, NCT00953758) of glasdegib in adult patients with myeloid malignancies who were refractory, resistant, or intolerant to previous agents, treatment was generally well tolerated and some preliminary clinical activity was observed.
 <xref rid="ajh25238-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> The most common treatment‐related adverse events (AEs) included dysgeusia (28%), decreased appetite (19%) and alopecia (15%).
 <xref rid="ajh25238-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> None of the 15 deaths reported were considered to be treatment‐related.
 <xref rid="ajh25238-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> In an open‐label, phase 1B study (NCT01546038), glasdegib was well tolerated in combination with low‐dose cytarabine (LDAC) or decitabine, or in combination with cytarabine/daunorubicin, in patients with AML or high‐risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
 <xref rid="ajh25238-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> The most common treatment‐related nonhematologic AEs were mostly grade 1‐2. The recommended phase 2 dose was established as 100 mg daily in combination with standard chemotherapy.
 <xref rid="ajh25238-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> In the phase 2 portion of the study (NCT01546038) in previously untreated patients with AML or high‐risk MDS, glasdegib plus LDAC improved OS compared with LDAC alone; the improvement was consistent among subgroups.
 <xref rid="ajh25238-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> Glasdegib plus LDAC was associated with an acceptable safety profile.
