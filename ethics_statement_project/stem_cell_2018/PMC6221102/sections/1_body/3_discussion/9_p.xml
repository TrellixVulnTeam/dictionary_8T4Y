<p>Although this phase 2 study is limited by small patient numbers and will require validation in a larger prospective trial, the results from this study are encouraging. Glasdegib in combination with cytarabine/daunorubicin was well tolerated and was associated with clinical activity in untreated patients with AML or high‐risk MDS, as reflected by potential prolongation of OS in the context of historical controls across all risk groups. CR rates matched historical controls; however, low rate of relapse and a suggestion of a favorable OS observed in the current study suggest that the antileukemia effect of glasdegib may be primarily mediated through the elimination of AML stem cells. To confirm this mechanism, future studies should evaluate the effect of glasdegib on MRD‐positive disease in the post‐remission setting. A randomized phase 3 trial of glasdegib in combination with chemotherapy on a 7 + 3 schedule is ongoing.</p>
