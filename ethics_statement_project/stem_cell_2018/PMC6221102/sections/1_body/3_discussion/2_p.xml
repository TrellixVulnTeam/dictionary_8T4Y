<p>This was a phase 2, open‐label, international, multicenter, safety and efficacy study wherein glasdegib was administered in combination with cytarabine/daunorubicin in previously untreated patients with AML or high‐risk MDS. Although the primary objective of demonstrating a ≥54% CR rate in patients aged ≥55 years was not achieved, the response rate of 46.4% (80% CI 38.7‐54.1) for all patients was within the range of those reported for other AML therapies (19‐76%, with most values ~40‐50%).
