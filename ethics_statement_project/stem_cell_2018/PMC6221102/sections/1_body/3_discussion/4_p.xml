<p>Around 24 months, the OS curve for patients 55 years or older began to plateau and extended to 36 months. These results suggest that patients who reached this time point (~40% of patients) had a low risk of death thereafter, which may indicate that a subpopulation of patients in particular derived a survival benefit from glasdegib treatment. The survival benefit does not appear to be influenced by transplantation, given that OS results with and without censoring for patients who underwent transplant were similar. Longer follow‐up and, particularly, randomized trials are required to better assess the possible effect glasdegib may have in improving OS. Responses were observed across diverse mutational profiles, suggesting the potential for broad efficacy of glasdegib in combination with cytarabine/daunorubicin.</p>
