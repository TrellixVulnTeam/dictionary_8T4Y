<p>The primary endpoint, CR rate 54%, was based on the CR rate of cytarabine/daunorubicin alone, adapted from Burnett et al.
 <xref rid="ajh25238-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">44</xref> Given the unique mechanism of action of glasdegib as an inhibitor of SMO, traditional endpoints such as CR or CR/CRi rate may underestimate its clinical benefit. For example, preclinical studies have shown that SMO inhibitors have little direct cytotoxicity on bulk AML blasts and would therefore not be expected to have a large effect on CR rates.

 <xref rid="ajh25238-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">46</xref> If glasdegib eliminated AML stem cells, one would expect the effect to be primarily on relapse rate and OS. Indeed, despite the small patient numbers in this trial, there was encouraging evidence of potentially prolonged OS with glasdegib compared with historical data. Although the response duration was short in this analysis, it was impacted by patients who discontinued treatment due to transplant and, because disease status was not collected during survival follow‚Äêup, it was also derived by censoring patients at the end of treatment (even those in CR, CRi, MLFS); therefore, the most conservative calculations were used.
