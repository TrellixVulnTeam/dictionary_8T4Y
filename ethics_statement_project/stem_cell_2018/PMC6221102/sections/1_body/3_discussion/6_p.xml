<p>Skin has been typically used to measure the pharmacodynamics of SMO inhibitors and glasdegib 100 mg once daily as monotherapy was previously associated with Hh pathway knockdown of &gt;80% in skin.
 <xref rid="ajh25238-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">47</xref> In the current study, assessment of the effects of glasdegib on Hh pathway‐dependent transcripts such as GLI1 and GLI2 in blood was attempted, but proved infeasible because baseline expression was undetectable in most patients (data not shown). Hence, a limitation of this study is the lack of specific data demonstrating modulation of Hh target genes in AML blasts or AML stem cells. Hh ligands are secreted proteins; therefore, any combination of autocrine and/or paracrine signaling between tumor and stroma would be susceptible to modulation by glasdegib.
 <xref rid="ajh25238-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">48</xref> Recent reports have implicated Hh signaling in the bone marrow stem cell niche as a primary mediator of chemoresistance, suggesting an alternative mechanism of action for glasdegib in AML.
