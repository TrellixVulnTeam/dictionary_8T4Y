<p>The Medical Research Council (MRC) series of randomised controlled trials of treatment in previously untreated patients with MM up to MRC Myeloma IX provided only limited data on performance status. Myeloma IX included intensive and non‐intensive pathways and enrolled patients of all ages. Patient‐reported HR‐QoL was a secondary endpoint in the trial protocol, with the aim of obtaining QoL data during the induction, consolidation and maintenance phases of treatment to assess the impact of the different regimens and components of treatment. Here, we present the results of the longitudinal analyses.</p>
