<p>In the longer‐term, at 2, 3, 4 and 5 years post‐randomisation, the pre‐specified subscales of Pain, Fatigue, Global Health Status/Quality of Life and Physical Functioning show few differences between the allocated treatments in the intensive pathway, non‐intensive pathway or maintenance phase. In the intensive pathway (Fig 
 <xref rid="bjh15459-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A) there is a relatively short‐term negative effect on both Fatigue and Physical Functioning that could be attributable to high‐dose therapy and ASCT. However, these negative effects do not persist beyond 1 year of follow‐up and do not translate to Global Health Status/Quality of Life, which has a general increasing trend, or to any of the other subscales. There are no clear temporal trends in the subscales of special interest for either the non‐intensive pathway or maintenance phase (Fig 
 <xref rid="bjh15459-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B and C respectively).
