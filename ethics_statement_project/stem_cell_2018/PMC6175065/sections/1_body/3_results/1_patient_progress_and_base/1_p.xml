<p>Overall 1970 patients were recruited to Myeloma IX; 1822 (92·49%) of these were included in the QoL sub‐study. The progress of patients through the sub‐study is shown for the 1819 participants at first randomisation (
 <italic>N</italic> = 1061 intensive pathway, 
 <italic>N</italic> = 758 non‐intensive pathway) and for the 751 patients at maintenance randomisation in the CONSORT diagrams (Fig 
 <xref rid="bjh15459-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In each population intensive and non‐intensive pathways [Table 
 <xref rid="bjh15459-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref> (key demographics and subscales of special interest), Table SI (haematological characteristics and remaining subscales)] and maintenance phase (Table SII) the distributions of age, gender, ISS and baseline QoL were similar by allocated treatment. The average ages of patients in the intensive pathway, non‐intensive pathway and maintenance phase were 58, 73 and 63 years respectively, the latter figure reflecting the inclusion of patients from the two pathways.
