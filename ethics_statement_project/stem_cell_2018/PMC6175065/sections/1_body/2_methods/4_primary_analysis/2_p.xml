<p>Multiple linear regression was used to regress the subscale of interest at each time point on the variable of interest. For the first randomisation, this was the allocated induction treatment (intensive: CTD 
 <italic>versus</italic> CVAD, non‐intensive: CTDa 
 <italic>versus</italic> MP) adjusting for the baseline value of the subscale, the bisphosphonate allocation (sodium clodronate or zoledronic acid), ISS (I‐III), age, sex, haemoglobin at baseline (&lt;115, ≥115 g/l for males; &lt;95, ≥95 g/l for females), corrected serum calcium at baseline (&lt;2·6, ≥2·6 mmol/l), serum creatinine at baseline (&lt;140, ≥140 μmol/l) and platelet count at baseline (&lt;150, ≥150 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/l). Similarly, for the maintenance randomisation, the variable of interest was the randomised treatment allocation (thalidomide 
 <italic>versus</italic> observation only) adjusting for the baseline value of the subscale, the treatment group allocated by the first randomisation, ISS (I–III), age and sex. The assumptions of the linear regression models were investigated for each comparison. All statistical tests were two‐sided and assessed at the 5% level of significance. As a guide for interpretation, an arbitrary difference of ≥10 points in a subscale was pre‐defined as the minimal important difference (MID) required to suggest clinical relevance (Osoba
