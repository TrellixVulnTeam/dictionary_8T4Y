<p>To collect patient‐reported QoL information, two patient‐completed European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) questionnaires were used: the EORTC QLQ‐C30 and QLQ‐MY24. The QLQ‐C30 is a fully validated tool used for assessing the QoL of cancer patients (Aaronson

 <xref rid="bjh15459-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>). When scored, the 30 questions produce 15 subscales relating to HR‐QoL. The QLQ‐MY24 is a specific questionnaire module for patients with MM (Stead 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="bjh15459-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>). The QLQ‐MY24 was validated throughout the original study period and consists of 24 questions, which when scored results in 5 subscales. As a result of the validation process the QLQ‐MY24 has been refined to the QLQ‐MY20 (removing the Social Support subscale) (Cocks 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="bjh15459-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). However, as it was administered, the original QLQ‐MY24 is used here.
