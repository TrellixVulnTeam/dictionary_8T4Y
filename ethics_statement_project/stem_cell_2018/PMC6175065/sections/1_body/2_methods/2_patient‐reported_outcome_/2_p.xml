<p>The over‐arching QoL population was defined as any patient in the intention to treat (ITT) population, who returned a questionnaire at any time point. The protocol stated that consenting patients should complete questionnaires at baseline, 3, 6, 12 months and then annually up to 5 years post‐randomisation, unless the patient participated in the maintenance randomisation when they should complete a pre‐maintenance randomisation questionnaire and then at the same intervals as above. For the primary analysis three separate QoL populations were considered; intensive, non‐intensive and maintenance. The intensive population was defined as any individual who returned a questionnaire during their induction treatment (pre‐second randomisation) and was randomised to receive CTD or CVAD. Similarly, the non‐intensive population was defined as any individual who returned a questionnaire during their induction treatment (pre‐second randomisation) and was randomised to receive CTDa or MP. Finally, the maintenance population was defined as any individual who was randomised to receive maintenance therapy (thalidomide or observation only) and returned a questionnaire during their treatment. In all three populations, questionnaire compliance was calculated as the proportion of those in the population who returned a questionnaire out of those expected to return a questionnaire (alive on study treatment and not withdrawn). An alternative population to the non‐intensive and intensive populations was defined for some of the exploratory analysis. This considered the two populations together as a first randomisation population; specifically, any individual who returned a questionnaire during their induction treatment (pre‐second randomisation) was included in this population.</p>
