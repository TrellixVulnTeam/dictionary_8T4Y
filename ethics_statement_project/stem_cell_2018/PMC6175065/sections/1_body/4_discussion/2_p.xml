<p>For the primary analysis, the only factor to demonstrate a clear and highly statistically significant difference between treatments was the Pain result at 3 months, in favour of CTDa (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0·0002), this result being supported by a persistent trend in benefit at 6 and 12 months. Although there were statistically significant differences at the 5% level in Fatigue at 3 months and Physical Functioning at 12 months, in favour of CTD, and in Global Health Status/Quality of Life at 3 months in the maintenance phase in favour of observation only compared with thalidomide maintenance, these differences were all slight, and should be interpreted with caution given the number of tests performed.
