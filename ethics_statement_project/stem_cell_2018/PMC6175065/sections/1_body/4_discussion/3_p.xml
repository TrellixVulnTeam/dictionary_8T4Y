<p>It is interesting that pain was reduced with CTDa compared with MP, especially in the short term. It is apparent that the treatment that is more active against the myeloma is also the most effective at relieving pain, despite potentially having greater toxicity. Although the therapies used in Myeloma IX have been largely superseded by more active agents, this finding is still highly relevant to current studies, and is important to explain to the patient, given that, although they are receiving potentially more toxic drugs, the greater activity of these drugs will render them more effective, both in terms of treating the myeloma itself, but also potentially in terms of relieving pain. The same applies to the other HR‚ÄêQoL measures, namely fatigue and physical functioning, which appeared to be improved with CTD/CTDa.</p>
