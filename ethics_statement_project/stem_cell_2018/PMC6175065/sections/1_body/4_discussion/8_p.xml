<p>These findings are broadly similar to the few published reports of comparable approaches to treatment. The VISTA trial (Delforge 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="bjh15459-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) reported that QoL was comparable between the two arms (bortezomib and MP (VMP) 
 <italic>versus</italic> MP) after approximately 1 year in a population similar to the non‐intensive pathway. The finding that thalidomide maintenance therapy has little impact on QoL is consistent with an earlier study (Verelst 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="bjh15459-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) and the combination of lenalidomide and low‐dose dexamethasone (RD) 
 <italic>versus</italic> MPT has been reported to improve OS without having a negative effect to QoL (Delforge 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="bjh15459-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>).
