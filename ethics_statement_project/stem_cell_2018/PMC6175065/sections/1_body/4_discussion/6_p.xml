<p>In our study, absence of significant differences at each time point during follow up indicates that there is little perturbation of HR‐QoL in the intensive pathway, when comparing the influence of CTD and CVAD, in the non‐intensive pathway, when investigating the difference between CTDa and MP, or in the maintenance phase when examining the impact of thalidomide maintenance therapy compared to observation only. Also, so far as the two bisphosphonates are concerned, the informal comparisons suggest little difference in HR‐QoL between patients taking clodronate and those receiving zoledronic acid.</p>
