<p>However, if these results are considered temporally and in the long‐term, most of the subscales are in favour of the experimental treatment. For example, Global Health Status/Quality of Life in the intensive pathway increases in favour of CTD as time passes, despite the difference not attaining statistical or clinical significance according to our pre‐determined MID. This raises the question, what is more important: a large change in an individual scale, or multiple small changes across key subscales that are maintained over time? Alternative definitions of a MID, whether it be ≥5 points (Kvam
