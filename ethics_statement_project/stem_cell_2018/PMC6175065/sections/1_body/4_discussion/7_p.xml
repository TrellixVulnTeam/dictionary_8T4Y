<p>These results are reassuring and supportive of our conclusions concerning the improved responses and survival outcomes following treatment in Myeloma IX. In the intensive pathway, CTD improved the overall response rate compared to CVAD and CTD was shown to be non‐inferior to CVAD in terms of PFS and OS (Morgan

 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="bjh15459-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2012c</xref>). Zoledronic acid reduced the risk of skeletal‐related events (Morgan

 <xref rid="bjh15459-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2012b</xref>) and significantly improved OS compared to sodium clodronate (Morgan 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="bjh15459-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). These gains in response and outcome were accompanied by some improvements rather than impairment of QoL, as determined by current HR‐QoL measurement. However, the trial setting and the relatively short periods of maintenance thalidomide delivered, median treatment duration was 7 months (range, 0–50 months) overall and 9 (range, 0–50 months) and 6 (range, 0–46 months) months in the intensive and non‐intensive pathways, respectively (Morgan 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="bjh15459-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2012c</xref>), preclude any firm conclusions about the longer term impact of cumulative neuropathic and other side effects on HR‐QoL.
