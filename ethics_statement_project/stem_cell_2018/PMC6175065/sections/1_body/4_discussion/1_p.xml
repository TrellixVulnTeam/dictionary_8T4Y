<p>The Myeloma IX study evaluated the use of an immunomodulatory agent (as both induction and maintenance treatment), zoledronic acid (a newer bisphosphonate agent that required parenteral treatment) and high dose therapy with ASCT (without entry criteria explicitly connected to patient age) and showed a number of positive clinical outcomes with improved overall response, progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The analysis in this report has shown that these improvements have not come at the cost of clinically relevant decreases in patient‐reported HR‐QoL over the short‐term (during initial treatment) or in the long‐term (during maintenance treatment and subsequent follow‐up).</p>
