  <p>Table of patients: 80 patients subdivided into 8 groups. In every patient we studied the effect of the aphthae on the quality of life. In every aphthae event we studied pain, difficulty in eating, difficulty in swallowing, and difficulty in producing sounds or speech. With each group we considered the number of relapses that each patient had, the type of aphtha on each patient, and where these aphthae were found in the oral cavity. We formed the following groups: placebo group (P), anaesthetic group (A), pharmaceutical drugs group (M), vitamin group (V), vitamin + local anaesthetic + pharmaceutical drugs (VAM), vitamin + pharmaceutical drugs (VM), anaesthetic + pharmaceutical drugs (AM), and anaesthetic vitamin group (AV).</p>
