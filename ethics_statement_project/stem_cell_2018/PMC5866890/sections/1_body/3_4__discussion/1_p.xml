<p>In the treatment of aphthous lesions, anaesthetics such as Lidocaine and Diclofenac have been used for some time. However the length of time these anaesthetics bring relief is brief [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Due to this defect we decided to test the use of Ropivacaine which is an anaesthetic drug used in aphthous lesions. Ropivacaine is an amide local anaesthetic that gives anaesthetic and analgesic relief over a long period. High dosages produce anaesthetic pain blockage which is used in surgery, while low dosages, through topical application, cause a sensitive blockage with a limited motor block; thus all the essential movements of the involved muscles are saved. The topical application acts mainly by inhibiting sodium influx through sodium-specific ion channels in the neuronal cell membrane.
