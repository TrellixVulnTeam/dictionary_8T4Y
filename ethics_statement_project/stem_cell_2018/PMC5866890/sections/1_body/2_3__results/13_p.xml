 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">Table 4</xref> shows the results of the multivariate analysis regarding the difficulty in swallowing. It shows that the use of anaesthetics significantly reduced the values by 1,8 pts on the analogical scale of 1 to 5 (IC 95%: 2,0–1,6, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0,001). The presence of multiple lesions and the male sex bring about a significant raise in the values, respectively, by 0,4 pts (IC 95%: 0,2–0,6, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0,001) and 0,3 pts (IC 95%: 0,1–0,4, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0,010).
