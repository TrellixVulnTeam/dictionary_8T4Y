<p>For people who are prone to getting aphthae, there are many situations that can cause them. For example, accidental bites of the mucosal tissue, too hard brushing of the mucosal tissue, or little lesions provoked by food can cause this problem. Often the original lesion has an abundance of floral bacteria in it that causes the involvement of the lymph nodes, which is a sign that often accompanies aphthae in the mouth. Aphthous lesions are very painful and are often associated with a general sickly feeling, and in some cases fever accompanies this feeling. When there are multiple aphthae, it is often difficult to eat due to the impossibility of chewing food and the pain that comes from the scraping of the food against the lesion. When the aphthae are located near the soft palate or esophagus, it becomes difficult to swallow due to odynophagia. The lip or tongue aphthae make it difficult to talk, but this is not due to mechanical problems caused by the aphthae, but it is the fear and the pain that cause the patients to limit their speech. In order to reduce the pain from this disorder, we wanted to add an anaesthetic drug to the normal therapy for aphthous lesions in order to observe if the satisfaction of the patient improved and also to see if the length of the disease's appearance can be shortened.</p>
