 <p>The use of anaesthetic drugs in the treatment of oral aphthosis is one of the pharmaceutical possibilities that a doctor can use for the most painful forms. Normally, Lidocaine or Diclofenac is used to treat this disease, but they can be used for a very limited time and so they are of little practical use. In this study, the authors have used Ropivacaine whose pharmaceutical kinetics allows the analgesic effect to be active for 60 to 90 minutes. In our research, we compared 8 groups of patients who have been given 3 principal pharmaceutical products: one group was given an anaesthetic drug, one had a topical medication administered which is often used for the treatment of aphthous lesions, and the last group was given a multivitamin. These pharmaceutical products were used alone and in various possible combinations in the 8 groups. The results of this study are very interesting and show that in all the groups that used anaesthetics there was more satisfaction on the patients' part because their pain level became more manageable right after the first application of the drug and the patients could carry on with their normal lives. </p>
