<p>The DMC will have two members, an experienced biostatistician and a clinician with considerable experience of clinical trials. The CRO will provide the DMC with a first interim analysis when 100 patients have been treated. Based on the results, the DMC will recommend the sponsor to continue or terminate the trial without communicating any results. The DMC will decide about further interim analyses. Before the DMC recommends early termination of the trial, it will try to get advice from the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
