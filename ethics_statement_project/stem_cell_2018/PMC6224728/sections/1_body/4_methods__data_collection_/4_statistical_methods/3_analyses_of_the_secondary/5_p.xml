<p>Quantitative data such as number of days with TPN, number of hospital days, total dose of opioids and CRP are analysed with independent t-test or with Mann-Whitney U test if the observed data material shows a significant skew. Descriptive statistics and explorative analysis will be used to study any differences between centres.</p>
