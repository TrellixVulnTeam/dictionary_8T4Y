<p>The PheedIt system will be used for data capture of clinical data and this will serve as the clinical database for the study. UCR will be responsible for set-up of the clinical database, support, programming of logical computerised checks, data management plan and management of the PheedIt system. Data from the checklist will be entered, cleaned and validated by the sponsor-appointed person. This appointed person should have signed a secrecy agreement with each study site and have the task delegated to enter/edit data into the database. The completed patient questionnaires (online 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1 SP2 SP3">supplementary files 1–3</xref>) will also be entered into the clinical database by the sponsor-appointed person. The entered data will be subject to logical computerised checks, and the output from these checks will be sent to the sponsor-appointed person for review and action. Actions to be taken by study staff as a result of the review of the check output should be documented, for example, on a data clarification form (DCF). The DCF must be signed and dated by the investigator, thereafter the clinical database can be updated. Any corrections made to entered data will be audited.
