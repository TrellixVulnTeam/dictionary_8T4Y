<p>Prior to treatment, the patient receives clear oral instructions and a demonstration on the use of Cooral by the nurse responsible for the patient. When the patient him/herself is able to administer the intraoral component until it feels comfortable, the responsible nurse will check to ensure that it has good contact with the oral mucous membrane. Cooling begins 30 min before the start of chemotherapy and continues until 30 min after the termination of the cytostatic infusion. During treatment, the patient may if necessary take out the component, for a maximum of 5  min, and replace it again. Food and drink should, whenever possible, be consumed either before or after the cooling session. Cooling continues throughout conditioning with cytostatics in the treatment schema melphalan (myeloma) and BEAM/BEAC (lymphoma). In lymphoma conditioning cures with a 12-hour infusion time (e.g., cytarabine), the cooling starts initially 30 min before the start of cytostatic treatment and continues 30 min after the start of the 12-hour cytostatic infusion. Then the patient is provided with Cooral for 30 min every 4 hours during the infusion. It is important to end with 30 min cooling of the oral mucous membrane after each completed cytostatic administration.</p>
