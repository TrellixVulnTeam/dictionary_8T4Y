<p>Patients will be provided with ice cubes/crushed ice or ice pop 30 min prior to the start of chemotherapy. Once the ice melts, the liquid is rinsed around the mouth to cool as large surface as possible of the oral mucosa. In addition, to achieve cooling of the hindmost part of the throat, the liquid is gurgled for a few seconds before it is swallowed or spat out. The procedure is repeated until 30 min after the termination of the cytostatic infusion. During treatment the patient may if necessary rest for a maximum of 5 min. Food and drink should, whenever possible, be consumed either before or after the cooling session. Cooling continues throughout conditioning with cytostatics in the treatment schema melphalan (myeloma) and BEAM/BEAC (lymphoma). In lymphoma conditioning cures with a 12-hour infusion time (e.g., cytarabine), the cooling starts initially 30 min prior to the start of cytostatic treatment and continues 30 min after the start of the 12-hour cytostatic infusion. Then the patient is provided with ice cubes/crushed ice or ice pop for 30 min every 4 hours during the infusion. It is important to end with 30 min cooling of the oral mucous membrane after each completed cytostatic administration.</p>
