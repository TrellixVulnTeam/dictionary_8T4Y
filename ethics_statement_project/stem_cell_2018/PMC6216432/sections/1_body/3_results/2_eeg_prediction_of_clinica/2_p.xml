<p>In light of the finding that posterior beta 2 power was significantly correlated with our primary endpoint across both the toys and social conditions, we next examined whether posterior beta 2 power, recorded in these two conditions, improved our ability to predict clinical outcomes at the 12‐month visit beyond prediction based on nonverbal NVIQ at the 12‐month visit. Baseline NVIQ was found to be strongly correlated with clinical outcomes, as reported in our previous paper. In this subsample of children who had EEG data for this study, baseline NVIQ was again found to be associated with improvement on the VABS socialization subscale (

 <sup>2</sup> = .21, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .06) at 12 months follow‐up. Children with higher baseline NVIQ were predicted to show more improvement in the clinical outcome, with NVIQ explaining 21% of the variance in the social communication outcome. However, adding EEG in a regression model using Type I SS (i.e., where each parameter is adjusted only for the preceding effects in the model) demonstrated that beta 2 power significantly improved model predictions. NVIQ and baseline posterior absolute beta 2 power from the toys condition together explain 64% of the variance in VABS socialization subscale score (

The red lines and red shading are the final regression plot that included the addition of beta 2 power (order‐dependent or hierarchical) and illustrate the improvement in prediction achieved by including this information.
