<p>Baseline relative EEG alpha, theta, and beta power and baseline absolute alpha and theta baseline power measures recorded over the frontal, central, and posterior regions were not found to be predictive of clinical outcomes (all 
 <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .05). However, consistent correlations between baseline absolute beta EEG power and the VABS socialization subscale score (the primary endpoint) were found. Correlations between the primary endpoint (Vineland social communication standard score) and baseline beta 2 absolute power are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="sct312347-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>. These significant associations were driven primarily by baseline absolute posterior beta 2 power (21–30 Hz) as can be seen in Table 
 <xref rid="sct312347-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>. Specifically, higher posterior beta 2 power was associated with increases in social abilities on the VABS across all three video conditions. Correlations between posterior beta 2 power and the EOWPVT and CGI‐I outcomes were only marginally significant or nonsignificant.
