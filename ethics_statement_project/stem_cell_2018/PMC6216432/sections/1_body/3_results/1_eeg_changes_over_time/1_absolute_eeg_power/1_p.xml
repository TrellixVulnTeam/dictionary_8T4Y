<p>Mean and standard deviations for baseline EEG absolute power variables are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="sct312347-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>. A significant reduction in absolute posterior theta power during the bubbles condition was found at 12 months (
 <italic>F</italic>(1, 32) = 4.81, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .04). Significant increases in absolute frontal alpha power during the social and bubbles conditions were found at 6 months (
 <italic>F</italic>(1, 33) = 4.13, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .05 and 
 <italic>F</italic>(1, 32) = 4.41, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .04, respectively). No significant changes in absolute beta power were found.
