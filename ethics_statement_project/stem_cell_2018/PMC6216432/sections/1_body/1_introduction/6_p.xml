<p>This study is an analysis of secondary outcomes in an exploratory, open‐label, phase I clinical trial designed to test the safety of an intravenous infusion of autologous umbilical cord blood as a treatment for social communication impairments in ASD (
 <italic>N</italic> = 25). In addition to the primary purpose of assessing safety, this open‐label trial was designed to identify potential clinical outcomes and biomarkers that showed initial evidence of usefulness for a planned randomized, double‐blind clinical trial (
 <italic>N</italic> = 180), currently underway. The safety and primary clinical outcome data have previously been published 
 <xref rid="sct312347-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref>. The purpose of this analysis was to explore whether EEG biomarkers show evidence of change after treatment and/or are useful in predicting response to treatment. Specifically, we explore whether (a) measures of EEG theta, alpha, and beta power change over a 12‐month period following treatment and (b) whether baseline EEG characteristics predict positive changes in social communication and language clinical outcomes.
