<p>Evaluating the efficacy of novel treatments is challenging due to the heterogeneity of the disorder and lack of well‐validated brain‐based measures that can predict response to treatment and/or assess changes in neural functioning. Candidates for brain‐based ASD biomarkers include electroencephalography (EEG)

EEG is of particular interest because it offers a feasible and relatively inexpensive way to assess changes in brain function with high temporal resolution, allowing for the characterization of aberrant brain networks with millisecond precision.
