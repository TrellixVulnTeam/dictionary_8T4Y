 <xref rid="sct312347-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref> we hypothesized that indices of beta band power may be sensitive to change over the course of the clinical trial. Not only were changes in relative beta power statistically significant at 12 months post‐infusion in posterior brain regions (toys, social, and bubbles conditions), but baseline beta power was also predictive of improved social communication skills, as measured via parent report on the VABS. Higher baseline beta power was associated with more improvement in the social communication clinical outcome. Baseline NVIQ alone explained 21% of the variance in the social communication outcome, while baseline NVIQ and beta power during the toys condition together explained 64% of the variance in the outcome. This indicates that a large percentage of variance can be explained using only two explanatory variables, which is advantageous because there is a reduced chance of overfitting and explaining random noise that is unique to the current sample. These exploratory findings will allow predictions in our larger placebo‐controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of umbilical cord blood in young children with ASD, which is underway.
