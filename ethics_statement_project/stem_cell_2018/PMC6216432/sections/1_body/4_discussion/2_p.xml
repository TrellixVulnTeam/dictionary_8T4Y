<p>Changes in EEG spectral characteristics were more frequently observed 12 months post‐infusion than 6 months post‐infusion, possibly because EEG changes are related to more long‐term restructuring of neural circuitry. Distinct changes were observed for videos with high social content and low social content. The different stimulus conditions may represent conditions of varying reward value which dictate engagement states. The differential results by stimulus type suggest that the EEG changes over time are caused by differential changes in reward value. This aligns with Stavropoulos and Carver

The authors hypothesized that the abnormalities in reward evaluation and processing common in ASD are associated with differences in theta (reward processing) and alpha (engagement state) bands. More work will be needed to determine if umbilical cord blood therapy may be influencing reward processing and engagement states, and thus positively impacting social communication abilities and peer relations, in young children with ASD.
