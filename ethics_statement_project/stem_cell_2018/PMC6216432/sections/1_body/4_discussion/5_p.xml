<p>The current findings may be influenced by follow‐up duration, treatment expectancy, and participant age. New patterns of EEG power may manifest after 12 months; likewise, changes we did observe may no longer be present after the 12‐month follow‐up time. Future work should incorporate more longitudinal time points to model the developmental trajectory of EEG power. While changes in EEG power will not be affected by parental expectancy (i.e., placebo effect), the associations between EEG power and parent‐reported clinical outcomes may be sensitive to differences in treatment expectancy. Future double‐blind placebo‐controlled trials will help to control for this bias. Finally, we expect differential brain growth over the course of 1 year in the youngest and oldest children due to differences in developmental stages across the 2–6 years age range. In an open‐label trial, we cannot attribute the positive changes in EEG observed to the umbilical cord treatment. However, we provide preliminary evidence that measures of EEG power in theta, alpha, and beta bands are sensitive to change over the course of a 12‐month open‐label clinical trial testing umbilical cord blood therapy for ASD, and that an EEG biomarker shows promise in identifying children who are likely to exhibit the highest level of improvement in their social communication skills.</p>
