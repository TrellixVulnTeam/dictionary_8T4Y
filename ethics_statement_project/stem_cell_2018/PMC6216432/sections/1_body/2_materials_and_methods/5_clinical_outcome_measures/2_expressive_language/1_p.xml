<p>The expressive one word picture vocabulary test 4 (EOWPVT) 
 <xref rid="sct312347-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">49</xref> is a clinician‐administered assessment which measures an individual's ability to match a spoken word with an image of an object, action, or concept. The EOWPVT was administered to each child at the baseline and 6‐ and 12‐month visits. The change in the raw score, a count of the number of spoken words, was used to measure change in expressive language over the course of the trial.
