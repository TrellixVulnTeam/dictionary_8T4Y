<p>Of the 25 total participants in the trial, 18 participants (72% of original sample) were able to provide sufficient artifact‐free data during the baseline visit in all three stimulus conditions (toys, social, and bubbles) and were included in this analysis. At the 6‐month visit 17 participants (94% of baseline sample, 68% of original sample) provided data for the toys and social conditions while 16 participants (89% of baseline sample, 64% of original sample) provided data for the bubbles condition. At the 12‐month visit 18 participants (100% of baseline sample, 72% of original sample) provided data for all three stimulus conditions. Attrition was due to drop out, noncompliance with study procedures, and excessive movement artifact.</p>
