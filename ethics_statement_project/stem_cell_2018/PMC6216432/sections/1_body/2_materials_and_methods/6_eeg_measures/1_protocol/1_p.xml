<p>Electroencephalography data were collected at baseline, 6‐ and 12‐month visits. Continuous EEG was recorded while three videos were shown twice to participants (total of 6 videos, 6 minutes). Video content included nursery rhymes (high social content, video 1), brightly colored toys (low social content, video 2), and bubbles (low social content, video 3). The order of videos was counterbalanced to eliminate any potential order effects. During the stimulus presentation, two behavioral assistants accompanied the child. The behavioral assistants ensured that standard conditions were in place during each experiment, including dimming the lights, seating participants in their parent's lap in a comfortable armchair 65 inches from the monitor and redirecting participants in instances of movement and/or poor attention to the videos. Video recording synchronized with the EEG was used throughout the session to allow post‐session editing of periods of inattention. EEG data were recorded from 124 electrodes with reference to Cz using a Hydrocel Geodesic Sensor Net and Net Amps 400 amplifier (Electrical Geodesics, Eugene, OR). Data were collected using Netstation 4.5.6 with a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz.</p>
