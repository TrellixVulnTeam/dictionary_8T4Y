<p>Absolute and relative spectral power (defined between 3 and 30 Hz) was examined during the social, toys, and bubbles conditions in three brain regions of interest (frontal, central, and posterior), per McEvoy et al. 
 <xref rid="sct312347-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">54</xref> Twelve electrodes covering the left hemisphere, right hemisphere, and midline were included in each of the three regions. Power values for each region were calculated by averaging the 12 electrodes within the region. The four power bands analyzed consisted of theta power (5–7 Hz), alpha power (8–10 Hz), beta 1 power (11–20 Hz), and beta 2 power (21–30 Hz).
