<p>To evaluate whether there were significant changes in EEG power over time, the 6‐ and 12‐month time points were compared to the baseline time point using repeated‐measures ANOVA. Next, to evaluate whether baseline EEG measures were predictive of clinical outcomes, bivariate linear regression models were conducted. For baseline EEG measures that were found to be predictive of clinical outcome, we also evaluated whether baseline EEG improved prediction of outcomes beyond prediction based on models using only NVIQ, which was previously found to be a strong predictor in our primary analyses of clinical outcomes
