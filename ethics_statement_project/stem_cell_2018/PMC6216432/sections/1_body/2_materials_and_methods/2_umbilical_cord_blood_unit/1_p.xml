<p>All participants had to have an available autologous umbilical cord blood unit banked at a family or public cord blood bank. During screening, potential participants' cord blood reports were reviewed to ensure they met the following pre‐cryopreservation criteria: (a) total nucleated cell count (TNCC) of 1–5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> per kilogram, (b) sterility cultures which were performed and negative, (c) negative maternal infectious disease markers tested on the maternal donor or cord blood product (minimally including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus, human T‐lymphotrophic virus, and syphilis), and (d) test sample available for additional testing. If the participant and his/her cord blood unit were likely to be eligible, a sample of the cord blood unit was shipped to Duke for confirmation of identity and potency testing 
 <xref rid="sct312347-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">42</xref>. Low‐resolution HLA testing was performed on both the participant and a sample of the cord blood unit for identity confirmation. If the CD45 viability on the test sample was &gt;40% and HLA‐identity was confirmed, the cryopreserved cord blood unit was shipped in a dry shipper to Duke Hospital Stem Cell Transplant Laboratory, where it was stored under liquid nitrogen until the day of infusion.
