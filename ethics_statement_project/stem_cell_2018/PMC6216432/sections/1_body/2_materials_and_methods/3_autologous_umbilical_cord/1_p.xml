Thawed cord blood units were tested for enumeration of TNCC, viable CD34 cells, colony‐forming units, cell viability via trypan blue, and sterility cultures. On the day of infusion, children were admitted to the Duke Children's Health Center Day Hospital, an outpatient treatment center, for their infusion. After premedication with Benadryl (0.5 mg/kg IV), Solu‐Medrol (0.5 mg/kg IV), and, if the child was awake and able to take oral medications, Tylenol (10 mg/kg PO), participants received either a portion of or their entire cord blood unit, adjusted to deliver 1–5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> cells per kilogram, via peripheral IV infusion more than 2–30 minutes. Intravenous fluids were administered at 1.5 times maintenance for 30 minutes to 2 hours after the cord blood infusion. Vital signs and pulse oximetry were monitored continuously during the infusion.
