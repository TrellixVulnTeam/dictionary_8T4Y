<p>This study was a phase I, single‐center, and open‐label trial of a single intravenous infusion of autologous umbilical cord blood in 25 children with ASD. All children were initially enrolled in a screening protocol to obtain medical records and information about their banked cord blood unit. All participants' caregivers completed a pre‐study screening interview by phone and provided medical records and videos for review by the study team to determine eligibility for the trial. Children with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD and a qualified banked autologous umbilical cord blood unit were eligible to participate. Written informed consent was obtained for both the screening and the treatment phases of the trial. The trial was approved by the Duke University Health System Institutional Review Board and conducted under IND #15949. Participants and their caregivers traveled to Duke University three times as part of their participation in the study. At their baseline visit, they were evaluated and received a single intravenous autologous cord blood infusion. At 6 and 12 months post‐infusion, participants returned for follow‐up clinical assessments. Additional caregiver interviews and questionnaires were collected at 3 and 9 months post‐infusion.</p>
