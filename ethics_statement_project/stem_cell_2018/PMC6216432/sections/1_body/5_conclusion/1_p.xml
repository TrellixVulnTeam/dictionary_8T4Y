<p>We demonstrated the feasibility of using EEG measures in an open‐label, phase I trial of intravenous infusion of autologous umbilical cord blood in young children with ASD. We described significant changes in EEG power reflected in a normalization of the EEG spectral characteristics by 12 months post‐infusion. Furthermore, higher baseline EEG beta 2 power was associated with a greater degree of improvement in social communication symptoms. Baseline measures of EEG beta 2 power and NVIQ together were highly predictive of treatment response, highlighting the potential for EEG as a tool to discriminate between children with varying degrees of improvement after treatment with autologous umbilical cord blood. These outcomes will be further evaluated on completion of the ongoing randomized phase II, placebo‐controlled study of cord blood in young children with ASD.</p>
