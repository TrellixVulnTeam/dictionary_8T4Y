 <p>This study was a phase I, single‐center, and open‐label trial of a single intravenous infusion of autologous umbilical cord blood in young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Twenty‐five children between the ages of 2 and 6 with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD and a qualified banked autologous umbilical cord blood unit were enrolled. Safety results and clinical outcomes measured at 6 and 12 months post‐infusion have been previously published. The purpose of the present analysis was to explore whether measures of electroencephalography (EEG) theta, alpha, and beta power showed evidence of change after treatment and whether baseline EEG characteristics were predictive of clinical improvement. The primary endpoint was the parent‐reported Vineland adaptive behavior scales‐II socialization subscale score, collected at baseline, 6‐ and 12‐month visits. In addition, the expressive one word picture vocabulary test 4 and the clinical global impression‐improvement scale were administered. Electrophysiological recordings were taken during viewing of dynamic social and nonsocial stimuli at 6 and 12 months post‐treatment. Significant changes in EEG spectral characteristics were found by 12 months post‐infusion, which were characterized by increased alpha and beta power and decreased EEG theta power. Furthermore, higher baseline posterior EEG beta power was associated with a greater degree of improvement in social communication symptoms, highlighting the potential for an EEG biomarker to predict variation in outcome. Taken together, the results suggest that EEG measures may be useful endpoints for future ASD clinical trials.
