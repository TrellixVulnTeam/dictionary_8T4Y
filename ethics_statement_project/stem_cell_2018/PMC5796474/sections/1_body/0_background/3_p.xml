<p id="Par32">As standard treatment for childhood ALCL, ALCL99, of which the efficacy and safety were confirmed in an international cooperative clinical study involving Europe and Japan, is selected. It refers to combination chemotherapy with dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, high-dose methotrexate, ifosfamide, etoposide, cytarabine, and doxorubicin. In 352 patients enrolled in the study, the 2-year event-free survival rate was 74.1%, and the 2-year survival rate was 92.5% [

Although the results of initial treatment for childhood ALCL are favorable, it is necessary to arrange treatment for a high-risk group (proportion: approximately 20%) and patients with relapse (proportion: approximately 30%). Retrospective studies suggest the efficacy of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for treatment-resisting patients with progression early after the start of initial treatment and those in whom relapse is frequently detected despite their responses to chemotherapy [
