<p id="Par39">In TB-BC010088 study involving Japanese adults [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], dose escalation was started from 1.2 mg/kg. In this dose level, no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed. In C25002 study involving non-Japanese children [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], dose escalation was started from 1.4 mg/kg. In this dose level also, no DLT was observed. From these results, we omitted dose escalation started from lower than 1.8 mg/m2. The maximum tolerance dose (MTD) of this drug was clarified as 1.8 mg/kg with good efficacy in SG035–0001 clinical study involving adult patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, we omitted consideration for more than 1.8 mg/kg dose. From the above, we adopted the design considering only a single dose of 1.8 mg/kg in this study.
