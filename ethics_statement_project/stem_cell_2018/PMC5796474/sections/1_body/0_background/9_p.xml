<p id="Par38">Clinical studies involving adults with recurrent or refractory HL or ALCL in Japan and other countries demonstrated the efficacy and safety of SGN-35. Internationally, a clinical study that is being conducted involving adults with recurrent or refractory HL or ALCL suggests its efficacy. Pediatric patients should be given medicines that have been appropriately evaluated for their use. In the past, however, new approved drugs have been used for pediatric patients without the confirmation of safety and efficacy in pediatric patients. Therefore, it is significant to examine the safety and efficacy of SGN-35 in Japanese children.</p>
