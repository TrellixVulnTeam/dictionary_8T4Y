<p id="Par35">SGN-35 consists of 3 components: (i) anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody (cAC10), (ii) a potent microtubule inhibitor, monomethylauristatin E (MMAE), and (iii) a linker decomposed by protease. A covalent bond between cAC10 and MMAE is mediated by this linker. The biological activity of SGN-35 appears through the following steps: initially, when SGN-35 binds to CD30 on the tumor cell surface, it is transported to lysosome through intracellular uptake as ADC-CD30 complex. Subsequently, MMAE is released in the intracellular area through protein-decomposing reactions. MMAE binds to tubulin, destroying an intracellular microtubular network and inducing the arrest of the cell cycle. As a result, apoptosis of CD30-expressing tumor cells occurs.</p>
