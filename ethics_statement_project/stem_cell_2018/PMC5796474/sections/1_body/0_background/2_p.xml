<p id="Par31">Basic treatment for childhood HL consists of chemotherapy and low-dose involved field radiotherapy (LD-IFRT). Chemotherapy alone or a combination of chemotherapy and LD-IFRT is selected in accordance with individual children. Furthermore, the intensity of initial chemotherapy is determined based on early treatment responsiveness in order to avoid unnecessary additional chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Chemotherapeutic regimens and treatment schedules differ among clinical studies. In Japan, treatment has not been standardized, and is selected based on the results of international clinical studies in accordance with individual patients. In a representative clinical study regarding childhood HL, the GPOH-HD-2002 study, chemotherapy with vincristine, etoposide, prednisolone, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and procarbazine and LD-IFRT for some patients improved the 5-year event-free survival rate to 89%, and the 5-year survival rate to 97% [

Treatment for patients with treatment resistance/relapse, accounting for approximately 10% of those with childhood HL, has not been standardized. Patients with local relapse after initial treatment for a low-risk group may be saved by chemotherapy and LD-IFRT, but the exacerbation-free survival rate ranges from 30 to 65% in other patients with treatment resistance/relapse even when hematopoietic cell transplantation is performed [
