These assessments should be conducted before the start of posttreatment. If examinations/observation/surveys are impossible for unavoidable reasons, such as complete withdrawal from this study, drop-out, death, and unfavorable conditions, the reasons must be recorded in original materials, and this study should be completed. In this case, deficits in examination/observation/survey items scheduled 28 days after the final administration are not regarded as deviations from the study protocol.</p>
