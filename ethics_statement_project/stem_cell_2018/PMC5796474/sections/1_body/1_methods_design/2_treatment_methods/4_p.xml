<p id="Par102">In this clinical study, 1.8 mg/kg of SGN-35 is administered to 6 children as Cohort 1. Based on the incidence of DLT during the DLT evaluation period, the tolerance of the dose/administration method is evaluated. If DLT is observed in ≤1 of the 6 children, 1.8 mg/kg of SGN-35 should be regarded as tolerable. On the other hand, if DLT is observed in 2 of the 6 children, a shift to Cohort 2 may be promoted. In Cohort 2, 3 subjects are added, and 1.8 mg/kg of SGN-35 is administered. If there is no DLT in the 3 subjects, 1.8 mg/kg of SGN-35 should be regarded as tolerable. However, if the third episode of DLT appears in Cohort 2, no patient will be newly registered.</p>
