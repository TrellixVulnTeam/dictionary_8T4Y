<p id="Par100">The drip infusion time of SGN-35 is ≥30 min. Rapid intravenous injection or bolus administration should be avoided. SGN-35 should be administered using a special line for drip infusion. It must not be mixed with other drugs. When administering SGN-35, the line for drip infusion should be washed in physiological saline (Japan Pharmacopeia) before and after SGN-35 administration so that this drug may not be mixed with other drugs.</p>
