<p id="Par52">The response duration refers to a duration from the first day of CR or PR evaluation until the first day of progressive disease (PD) evaluation or the day of death related to some factor (earlier). With respect to data on the response duration in subjects continuing to participate in this study until analysis without PD, those receiving anti-tumor treatment other than the test regimen and stem cell transplantation, and those excluded from this study before CR or PR achievement, the final day of image assessment on which disease progression is ruled out in lesions to be measured is regarded as the day of censoring.
