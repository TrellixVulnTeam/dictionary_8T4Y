<p id="Par54">PFS refers to a period from the first day of administration until the first day of PD evaluation or the day of death related to some factor (earlier). With respect to data on PFS in subjects who continued study participation until analysis without showing PD, those who received anti-tumor treatment other than test treatment and stem cell transplantation, and those excluded from this study before CR or PR evaluation, the last day of image assessment on which disease progression was ruled out in lesions to be measured is regarded as the day of censoring. Subjects in whom image assessment after initial administration was not conducted, is censored at day 1.
