We performed a\u00a0retrospective analysis of newly diagnosed MM patients who underwent ASCT between January 2010 and July 2016. A non-transplanted group with similar clinical characteristics, aged 65-70\u00a0years old, diagnosed and treated in the same timeline was used for comparison. We analyzed a total of 155 patients, 132 of which underwent ASCT (\u2264\u200965\u00a0years, n\u2009=\u2009103, median 56\u00a0years; >\u200965\u00a0years, n\u2009=\u200929, median 67\u00a0years) and 23 non-transplanted (median 68\u00a0years).
