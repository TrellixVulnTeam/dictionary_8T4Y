<p id="Par10">For transplant safety assessment, data were collected on hematologic toxicity (transfusion needs, time in days until peripheral neutrophil, and platelet count recovery), mucositis (grade, use and duration in days of intravenous morphine), and infection (number of days of fever, antibiotics used, days under antibiotics), days of hospitalization, and need for intensive care during the transplant procedure. Engraftment was defined by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 0.5 × 109/L for three consecutive days, and platelet count ≥ 20 × 109/L unsupported by platelet transfusions in the last 7 days. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) was defined as death during the first 100 days after ASCT.</p>
