<p id="Par6">Retrospective analysis of 132 MM patients consecutively submitted to ASCT between January 2010 and July 2016, at the Department of Hematology of Centro Hospitalar São João (Porto, Portugal). Patients were stratified by age into two groups: group 1, ≤ 65 years old, and group 2, &gt; 65 years old. Data from 65- to 70-year-old patients diagnosed in this same calendar period who were not transplanted were used for comparison (group 3). Exclusion criteria included the following: plasma cell leukemia or amyloidosis at diagnosis, death during induction therapy in patients with indication for ASCT or during the first line of treatment in patients with no indication for ASCT who did not complete all cycles, patients in palliative care. This center also received patients referred for ASCT in whom diagnosis and induction therapy were performed at a different hospital. For risk stratification, we used the International Staging System (ISS) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], Durie Salmon Staging System (DS) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for deletion 17p, deletion 1p, gain of 1q, deletion 13q, deletion 16q, deletion 14q, and translocations
