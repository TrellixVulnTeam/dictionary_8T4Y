<p id="Par17">Regarding treatment protocol selection (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), there was no statistical difference in choice of novel agents according to age (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.17) or ASCT status (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.58) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Concerning treatment response after induction, 73% of younger transplanted patients had at least very good partial response (VGPR) as well as 69% of the elderly transplanted and 65% of the elderly non-transplanted patients (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Despite these differences, it was not statistically relevant, either in the transplanted group (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.72) or in the non-transplanted group (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.77) when compared to its age-adjusted cohort. Considering transplanted patients, age did not correlate to the selection of mobilization regimen (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.22), to the number of collected PBPCs (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.09), or to the number of apheresis for appropriate collection (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.55).
