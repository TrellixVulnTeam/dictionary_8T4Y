<p id="Par19">However, when assessed by the dose of melphalan solely in the elderly group, older patients conditioned by MEL200 seem to have fewer days until neutrophil recovery but with a greater need for transfusion support. These patients had more mucositis (grade and need of support) and more days of antibiotics than the ones conditioned by rMEL. Five patients had to be admitted to intensive care unit (3 under 65 years old and 2 over 65 years old), four of them due to septic shock, and one patient for stroke and bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonitis. The median inpatient days were 21 (range 15 to 91), and there were no differences between groups (
