<p id="Par23">Data on progression and survival status were collected in September 2016 with a median follow-up of 30 months. Elderly patients had a median EFS of 45 months vs 59 months in younger patient group (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.63), with no difference in OS (HR 1.73, CI 0.81–3.70, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.15) (Graph 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Elderly patients conditioned with MEL200 had a median EFS of 62 months vs 45 months in elderly patients treated with a reduced dose of melphalan, however with no statistical significance (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.79). There was no effect in OS according to melphalan dose in these patients (HR 0.80, CI 0.22–2.86, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.73) (Graph 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). When comparing elderly transplanted patients to non-transplanted patients, there is an essential difference in survival curves. There is an advantage of the transplanted group on EFS with a median time of 45 months vs 27 months on the non-transplanted group (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.014). This advantage remains significant on OS (Graph 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).
