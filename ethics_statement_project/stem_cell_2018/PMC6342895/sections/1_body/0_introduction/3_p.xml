<p id="Par4">Aging determines a progressive deterioration of physiological reserves and endurance that may increase morbidity and mortality, jeopardizing the effectiveness of ASCT as part of treatment options in MM. Despite these concerns, studies show there is a blatant benefit in survival for transplanted elderly patients [
