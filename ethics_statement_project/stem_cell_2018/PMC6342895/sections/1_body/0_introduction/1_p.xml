On the one hand, the lengthening of life expectancy is related to an increase in the incidence of oncological diseases, and on the other hand, the improvement of diagnostic acuity and new therapeutic options on MM has led to a longer survival of elderly patients from median 19 months (in 1973) to 6.1 years (in 2004) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] confirmed a significant increase in cases diagnosed in older age groups when comparing to the 1950s and early 2000s, with the median age at diagnosis of MM increasing from 70 to 74 years, as well as doubling the proportion of newly diagnosed patients aged 80 years or older.
