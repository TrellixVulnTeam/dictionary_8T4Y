<p id="Par24">In our analysis, elderly patients have more toxicity with MEL200 when comparing to reduced doses of melphalan, yet these are manageable complications with the current supportive standard of care. Complications included increased demand for transfusions, support for mucositis, and need for antibiotics for infection control. It is noteworthy that elderly patients treated with MEL200 had less median days of aplasia, which may seem contradictory. Nonetheless, these patients received more supportive measures (higher number of transfused platelet units and erythrocyte concentrates) which may indicate a slower global recuperation. Non-transplanted elderly patients had fewer hospitalizations due to complications, and most of them had low severity, preserving ambulatory management of these patients which is a general aim when handling patients with no curative intent.</p>
