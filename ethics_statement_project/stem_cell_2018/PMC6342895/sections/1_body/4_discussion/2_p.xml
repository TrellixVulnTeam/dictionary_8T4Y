<p>There was no excess transplant-related mortality (TRM) in elderly patients and inpatient days were the same regardless of age despite higher toxicity, reinforcing there was an adequate control of complications. Even though autologous transplantation is a standard of care for multiple myeloma, age still plays an important role when pondering this intensification of treatment as questions are raised on the endurance of elderly patients to receive high-dose chemotherapy. It has been demonstrated in several studies that improvement of supportive care provides adequate control of complications [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Cheikh et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] already hypothesized that improvement in supportive care, particularly the use of G-CSF and prophylactic care after intensive chemotherapy, had a positive effect reducing TRM; likewise, Auner et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] observed a marked decrease in mortality throughout the decade 1991–2001, ≤ 2.4% in all age groups, but considerably higher in older than in younger patients; additionally, in another study, Muchtar et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] showed evidence of decreasing infectious complications, transfusion needs, and inpatient days in this same age group from 1998 to 2015, corroborating the favorable impact of supportive care and emphasizing the absence of a biological reason against age to ASCT eligibility.
