<p id="Par29">Our study reflects real data on managing ASCT in elderly patients, offering them possibility of better results and better survival despite all the limitations we mentioned. From our results and revised published data to date, we may argue that ASCT is an essential step of MM treatment and should be offered as a treatment option regardless of age. However, there is a need to include elderly patients in transplant randomized trials to determine a survival benefit in an era of constant newer and effective drugs available.</p>
