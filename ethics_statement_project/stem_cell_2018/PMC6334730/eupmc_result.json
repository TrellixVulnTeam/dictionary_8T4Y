are an aggressive group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas with poor outcomes for most subtypes and no accepted standard of care for relapsed patients. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of forodesine, a novel purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibitor, in patients with relapsed peripheral T cell lymphomas. Patients with histologically confirmed disease, progression after \u2265\u20091 prior treatment, and an objective response to last treatment received oral forodesine 300\u00a0mg twice-daily. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. Forty-eight patients (median age, 69.5\u00a0years; median of 2 prior treatments) received forodesine. In phase 1 (n\u2009=\u20093 evaluable), no dose-limiting toxicity was observed during the first 28\u00a0days of forodesine treatment. In phase 2 (n\u2009=\u200941 evaluable), the ORR for the primary and final analyses was 22% (90% CI 12-35%) and 25% (90% CI 14-38%), respectively, including four complete responses (10%). Median PFS and OS were 1.9 and 15.6\u00a0months, respectively. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were lymphopenia (96%), leukopenia (42%), and neutropenia (35%). Dose reduction and discontinuation due to adverse events were uncommon. Secondary B cell lymphoma developed in five patients, of whom four were positive for Epstein-Barr virus. In conclusion, forodesine has single-agent activity within the range of approved therapies in relapsed peripheral T cell lymphomas, with a manageable safety profile, and may represent a viable treatment option for this difficult-to-treat population.", "affiliation": "Department of Hematology, National Cancer Center Hospital, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-0045, Japan. dmaruyam@ncc.go.jp.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Clinical Trial, Phase II", "research-article", "Multicenter Study", "Clinical Trial, Phase I", "Journal Article"]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "BL", "qualifierName": "blood", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "DT", "qualifierName": "drug therapy", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Recurrence"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Pyrimidinones", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "AD", "qualifierName": "administration & dosage", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}, {"abbreviation": "AE", "qualifierName": "adverse effects", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "PK", "qualifierName": "pharmacokinetics", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Purine Nucleosides", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "AD", "qualifierName": "administration & dosage", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}, {"abbreviation": "AE", "qualifierName": "adverse effects", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "PK", "qualifierName": "pharmacokinetics", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Adult"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Aged"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Female"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Male"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Progression-free Survival", "Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma", "Forodesine", "Overall Response Rate", "Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase Inhibitor"]}, "chemicalList": {"chemical": [{"name": "Pyrimidinones", "registryNumber": "0"}, {"name": "Purine Nucleosides", "registryNumber": "0"}, {"name": "forodesine", "registryNumber": "426X066ELK"}]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00277-018-3418-2"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6334730"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6334730?pdf=render"}]}, "commentCorrectionList": {"commentCorrection": {"id": "30054705", "source": "MED", "reference": "Ann Hematol. 2018 Dec;97(12):2529-2530", "type": "Erratum in", "orderIn": "1"}}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "4", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "Y", "tmAccessionTypeList": {"accessionType": "nct"}, "dateOfCompletion": "2019-01-23", "dateOfCreation": "2018-07-06", "firstIndexDate": "2018-07-06", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-11", "dateOfRevision": "2020-02-25", "electronicPublicationDate": "2018-07-05", "firstPublicationDate": "2018-07-05"}, "htmllinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6334730", "abstract": "Peripheral T cell lymphomas are an aggressive group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas with poor outcomes for most subtypes and no accepted standard of care for relapsed patients.
