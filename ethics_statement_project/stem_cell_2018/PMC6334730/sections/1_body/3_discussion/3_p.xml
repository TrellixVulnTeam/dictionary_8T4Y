<p id="Par23">The safety profile of forodesine 300Â mg twice-daily was acceptable. Although dose delays because of AEs occurred in 35% of patients, dose reduction was only needed in 1 patient (2%), and discontinuation due to AEs occurred in 11 patients (23%). Toxicity consisted mostly of lymphopenia and other hematologic AEs; non-hematologic toxicities were generally mild/moderate in severity. The high rate of lymphopenia is thought to reflect the mechanism of action of forodesine. By inhibiting PNP, forodesine induces lymphocyte apoptosis (mainly T cells), leading to a reduction in lymphocyte counts and causing an immunosuppressive effect that may result in an increased risk of infection and secondary B cell lymphoma.</p>
