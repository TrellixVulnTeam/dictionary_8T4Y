<p id="Par21">This study demonstrated that forodesine has promising single-agent activity and led to its approval in Japan for treatment of relapsed/refractory PTCL. The ORR (22–25%) is comparable with ORRs reported in phase 2 studies of several recently approved agents for PTCL, including pralatrexate, romidepsin, and belinostat [

Differences in patient populations, histopathologic subtype distributions, disease status, and pretreatment characteristics make comparisons across studies difficult. Our study cohort mostly consisted of patients with PTCL-NOS and AITL; the ORR was numerically higher for those with AITL (33%) than for those with PTCL-NOS (23%). In a recent phase 2 study of patients with relapsed/refractory PTCL, lenalidomide demonstrated an ORR of 22%, and also showed a higher ORR in the AITL subset (31%) [

 <sup>+</sup> ALCL but has less activity against other PTCL subtypes [
