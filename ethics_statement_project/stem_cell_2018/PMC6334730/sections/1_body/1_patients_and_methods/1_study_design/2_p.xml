<p id="Par6">In phase 1, forodesine 300 mg (three 100-mg capsules) was given twice-daily after meals in a 28-day cycle. Phase 2 was initiated because none of the first three patients completing the 28-day cycle had dose-limiting toxicity (DLT; defined as treatment-related grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity excluding nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea or grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia lasting ≥ 7 days). During phase 2, patients received forodesine until disease progression (PD), unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Forodesine was stopped temporarily for ≤ 2 weeks in the event of DLT or if needed for management of adverse events (AEs). After recovery, a single-dose reduction to 200 mg twice-daily was allowed.</p>
