<p id="Par7">Patients had study visits on days 1 and 15 of cycles 1–4 and day 1 of subsequent cycles. After 22 patients completed 2 cycles, an interim efficacy analysis was conducted using a Simon minimax 2-step design to assess for futility (≤ 2 patients with objective responses); the study was to be terminated if futility was demonstrated. If futility was not demonstrated, the study was to be continued. Data cutoff was to be conducted when all the patients for efficacy evaluation completed the clinical study procedure by week 24. Based on data obtained until that time point, the primary analysis was to be conducted.</p>
