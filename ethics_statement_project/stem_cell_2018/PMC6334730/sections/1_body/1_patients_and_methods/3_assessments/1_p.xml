<p id="Par10">Tumor assessments were conducted after every 2 cycles for the first 24 weeks and then every 4 cycles. Efficacy was evaluated by an Independent Efficacy Assessment Committee (IEAC) according to revised International Working Group criteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and classified as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease, or PD. The primary efficacy endpoint was IEAC-assessed ORR, consisting of the proportion of evaluable patients with CR or PR. Secondary efficacy endpoints included investigator-assessed ORR, duration of response (DoR), time to treatment failure, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Primary analyses were conducted on data obtained by the time of data cutoff. In addition, final analyses on data from the entire period (including after the data cutoff) were also described for information purposes. For analyses other than the primary endpoint, results of final analyses were described.
