<p id="Par12">The first seven patients comprised the full pharmacokinetics set; they received in-patient treatment for the first 4 days and had an additional visit on day 8. Blood samples were collected predose and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h after the first dose on both days 1 and 15 and also predose on days 2, 3, 4, 8, 29, and 57. In all other patients, blood samples were collected predose for the first dose on days 1, 15, 29, and 57. Plasma forodesine concentrations were measured using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method, with a lower limit of quantitation of 2.5 ng/mL. Key pharmacokinetic parameters, including the observed maximum concentration (

 <sub>max</sub>) and the area under the concentration-time curve to the last measurable drug concentration (AUC
 <sub>last</sub>), were determined by non-compartmental analysis using WinNonlin. Additional blood samples were collected at the above times for measurement of plasma dGuo concentrations by a validated LC/MS/MS with a lower limit of quantitation of 5.0 ng/mL.
