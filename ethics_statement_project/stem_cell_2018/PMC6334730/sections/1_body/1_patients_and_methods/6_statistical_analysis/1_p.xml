<p id="Par13">Efficacy was evaluated in the full analysis set consisting of patients who received ≥ 1 dose of forodesine and had a postbaseline efficacy assessment. Using the Simon minimax two-step design [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], a sample size of 40 evaluable patients in phase 2 would have 80% statistical power at a one-sided α of 0.05 for showing a threshold ORR of 10%, assuming an expected ORR of 25%. A one-sided binomial test was used to determine if the observed ORR was above the predefined 10% threshold rate. To account for potential non-evaluable patients, the target sample size in phase 2 was set at 43. Time-to-event parameters were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods [
