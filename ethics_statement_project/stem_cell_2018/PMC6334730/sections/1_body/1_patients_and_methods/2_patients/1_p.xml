<p id="Par8">Japanese patients aged ≥ 20 years with histopathologically confirmed PTCL were eligible if they had PD after ≥ 1 prior treatment and had achieved an objective response on their last treatment. PTCL was defined according to the 2008 WHO Classification [3] and included PTCL-NOS, AITL, ALCL (ALK-positive or ALK-negative), extranodal natural killer cell/TCL (nasal type), enteropathy-associated TCL, hepatosplenic TCL, subcutaneous panniculitis-like TCL, and transformed mycosis fungoides. The PTCL subtype was diagnosed in each institution from lesion biopsy specimens and confirmed by an Independent Pathology Review Committee. Eligible patients had an enlarged lymph node or extranodal mass that was measurable in two perpendicular directions by computed tomography, with the greatest diameter &gt; 1.5 cm; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1; and adequate hematopoietic, liver, and kidney function.</p>
