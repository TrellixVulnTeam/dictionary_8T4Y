 <sub>max</sub>, 435.7 [± 152.9] ng/mL) and then decreased gradually (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). On day 15, the mean pretreatment concentration was 509.7 ng/mL (± 180.4) and after dosing, again increased over 4 h to a mean of 683.1 ng/mL (± 162.9) before gradually decreasing. Throughout the treatment period, mean trough plasma forodesine concentrations at each time point remained within a range of 460 to 540 ng/mL. The AUC
 <sub>last</sub> values after dosing on days 1 and 15 were 3540 and 6520 ng h/mL, indicating an accumulation ratio of 1.8. Plasma dGuo levels increased over 8 h after forodesine dosing, with mean trough concentrations at each time point within a range of 551 to 840 ng/mL. Plasma forodesine and dGuo concentrations on days 1 and 15 showed a positive relationship according to a maximum drug effect model.
