<p id="Par17">Twenty-two patients (46%) experienced serious AEs, most commonly infections (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8). Pneumonia (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) was the only serious infection reported in &gt; 1 patient. Secondary B cell lymphoma was reported in five patients; all were women aged 65 to 75 years, and three entered the study with AITL and two with PTCL-NOS. In four of five patients, lymphoma cells were positive for EBV encoded RNA-1 on in situ hybridization. Based on an exploratory analysis, the patients who developed secondary B cell lymphoma had received forodesine for a median of 11.6 months (range, 2.2–16.6 months); the median duration from forodesine initiation to development of secondary B cell lymphoma was 14.3 months (range, 6.7–16.6 months). Median trough lymphocyte counts in patients who did (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) or did not (
 <italic>n</italic> = 43) develop secondary B cell lymphoma were 87 per mm
 <sup>3</sup> (range, 51–120) and 71 per mm
 <sup>3</sup> (range, 0–731), respectively. Median trough CD4
 <sup>+</sup> lymphocyte counts in patients who did (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) or did not (
 <italic>n</italic> = 42) develop secondary B cell lymphoma were 44 per mm
 <sup>3</sup> (range, 18–162) and 51/mm
 <sup>3</sup> (range, 5–3274), respectively. Outcome for patients who developed secondary B cell lymphoma are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. One patient achieved CR to treatment for secondary B cell lymphoma and survived with PTCL at the time of the final analysis. Three patients died of lymphoma (PTCL and/or secondary B cell lymphoma), and the outcome of one patient is unknown.
