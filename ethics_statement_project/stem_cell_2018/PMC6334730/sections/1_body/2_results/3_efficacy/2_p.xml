<p id="Par19">For the major PTCL subtypes in the phase 1 and 2 cohorts combined, the ORR was 33% (95% CI 13–59%) among 18 evaluable patients with AITL and 23% (95% CI 8–45%) among 22 evaluable patients with PTCL-NOS. ORRs &gt; 30% were observed in several predefined subgroups, including age &lt; 65 years (6/16; 38%), two prior treatment regimens (3/9; 33%), stage III disease (7/19; 37%), and low/normal lactate dehydrogenase (9/25; 36%) (Table
