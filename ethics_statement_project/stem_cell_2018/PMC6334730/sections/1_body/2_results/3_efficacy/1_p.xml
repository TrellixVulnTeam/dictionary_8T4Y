<p id="Par18">Among the 41 evaluable patients in phase 2, the ORR (IEAC assessment) for the primary analysis was 22% (90% CI 12–35%), and included four with CR (10%) and five with PR (12%) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>), which was significantly greater than the predefined 10% threshold rate (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.018). The investigator-assessed ORR was 22%, and included three patients with CR and six with PR. One of four patients in phase 1 also achieved a PR. Furthermore, the ORR at the final analysis was 25% (90% CI 14–38%), and included four patients with CR (10%) and six with PR (15%) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The median time to response was 2.8 months (range, 1.8–12.8 months), and the median time to treatment failure was 2.2 months (95% CI 1.8–5.0 months) (data not shown). Median DoR was 10.4 months (95% CI 5.9–16.0 months) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a), median PFS was 1.9 months (95% CI 1.8–4.6 months) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b), and median OS was 15.6 months (95% CI 10.7–NE months) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c) among evaluable patients. Two-year OS was 39%. Compared with non-responders, the hazard ratios for PFS and OS among responders were 0.21 (95% CI 0.09–0.48) and 0.19 (95% CI 0.04–0.80), respectively (Fig.
