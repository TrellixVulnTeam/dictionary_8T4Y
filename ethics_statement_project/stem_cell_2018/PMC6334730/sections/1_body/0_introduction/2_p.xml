<p id="Par3">Prior to forodesine, several agents were approved for treatment of relapsed/refractory PTCL, including the folate antagonist pralatrexate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and the histone deacetylase inhibitors romidepsin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and belinostat [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] in the USA, and chidamide in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Additionally, the anti-CC chemokine receptor 4 monoclonal antibody mogamulizumab was approved in Japan for treatment of anti-CC chemokine receptor 4-positive relapsed/refractory PTCL [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and the anti-CD30 antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin was approved for treatment of relapsed/refractory ALCL [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Objective response rates (ORRs) for these agents in relapsed/refractory PTCL generally ranged from 25 to 35% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], with brentuximab vedotin producing an ORR of 86% in ALCL [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] but 21% in non-ALCL PTCL [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].
