<p id="Par4">Children born deficient in purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) have reduced T cell counts, suggesting that PNP may be a target for treatment of T cell-mediated diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Forodesine (BCX1777, Immucillin-H) is a novel PNP inhibitor, 100 to 1000 times more potent than other agents of this class [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. By inhibiting PNP, forodesine augments 2′-deoxyguanosine (dGuo) levels in plasma and T cells. The enzyme 2′-deoxycytidine kinase, which is highly upregulated in malignant T cells, phosphorylates dGuo to form deoxyguanosine monophosphate and then 2′-deoxyguanosine triphosphate. Accumulation of 2′-deoxyguanosine triphosphate causes an imbalance of the deoxyribonucleotide pool leading to T cell apoptosis. Forodesine was tolerated at doses of 200–300 mg once daily and exhibited preliminary evidence of anti-tumor efficacy in patients with PTCLs or cutaneous TCLs [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data in healthy volunteers (data on file) suggested that a regimen of 300 mg twice-daily would be tolerable and provide forodesine exposure necessary for improving efficacy. Therefore, we conducted a phase 1/2 study of forodesine 300 mg twice-daily in Japanese patients with relapsed PTCL.
