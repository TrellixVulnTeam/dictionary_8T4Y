<p id="Par8">The potential eligibility for clinical trials was defined according to common exclusion criteria in phase III clinical trials and explicitly captured by the TLN registry. Patients were classified as trial-ineligible when at least one of the following exclusion criteria had been fulfilled: heart failure, renal failure, other renal diseases, liver diseases, polyneuropathy, and HIV positivity. When none of these criteria were fulfilled, patients were classified as potentially trial-eligible. Detailed eligibility classification rules have been described before [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The exclusion criteria in phase III clinical trials are often limited to a certain grade/severity; as grade or severity of parameters (especially of polyneuropathy and renal failure) were not documented in the registry, all patients with documented polyneuropathy or renal failure were classified as trial-ineligible.
