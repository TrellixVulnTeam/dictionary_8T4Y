<p id="Par9">All analyses were performed using Statistica Version 13.1 and SAS for Windows version 9.4 (Copyright© 2002–2012 SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Time to events was analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method. PFS was defined as the interval between start of first-line therapy and the date of first progression or death, whatever came first. Data of patients without such an event before start of second-line therapy were censored at either the start of second-line therapy or at last contact, whatever came first. OS was defined as the interval between start of first-line therapy and the date of death from any cause. Data of patients alive or lost to follow-up were censored at last contact. DSS was calculated from start of first-line therapy until date of death due to MM. Data of patients alive, lost to follow-up, or with other causes of death were censored at last contact or at date of death, whatever came last.</p>
