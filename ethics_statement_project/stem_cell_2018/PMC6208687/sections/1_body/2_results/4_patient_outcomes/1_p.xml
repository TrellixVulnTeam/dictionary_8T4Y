<p id="Par14">Regardless of the type of treatment, median first-line PFS of the potentially trial-eligible patients was markedly longer than that of the trial-ineligible patients: 27.3 months, 95% CI (confidence interval) 23.3–33.0 vs. 16.2 months, 95% CI 11.1–20.4 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). The 3-year PFS rate was 39.9% for potentially trial-eligible patients (95% CI 31.6–48.1%) and 18.8% for trial-ineligible patients (95% CI 9.8–29.9%). At the time of this analysis, 148 patients (52%) had died, corresponding to 47% of the potentially trial-eligible and 63% of the trial-ineligible patients. Median OS for the whole cohort was 52.0 months (95% CI 43.5–58.7, data on file). Median OS was considerably longer for potentially trial-eligible patients: 58.6 months (95% CI 48.6–64.4) than for trial-ineligible patients: 34.2 months (95% CI 21.6–48.1, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). The 3-year OS rate was 69.4% for potentially trial-eligible patients (95% CI 61.9–75.7%) and 44.4% for trial-ineligible patients (95% CI 33.3–55.0%).
