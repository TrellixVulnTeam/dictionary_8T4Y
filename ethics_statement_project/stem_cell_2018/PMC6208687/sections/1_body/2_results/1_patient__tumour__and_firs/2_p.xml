 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> presents the first-line treatment characteristics for the patient subgroups and all patients. The majority of the patients received a proteasome inhibitor (PI): 81% of the trial-ineligible and 73% of the trial-eligible patients, while approximately 10% of the patients in both groups received an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD). The most frequently applied first-line regimen was a combination of bortezomib and melphalan, with or without additional prednisone (given to 43% of the trial-ineligible and 41% of the potentially trial-eligible patients). Trial-ineligible patients more often received bortezomib monotherapy (13% vs. 6%).
