<p id="Par10">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> presents the patient and tumour characteristics of the 285 patients included into this analysis. Thirty-two percent (
 <italic>n</italic> = 91) of all patients were classified as trial-ineligible as explained by the criteria listed in the methods section. Median age at start of therapy was 74 years; trial-ineligible patients were older (76 years, range 56–92) than potentially trial-eligible patients (73 years, range 42–90 years). Prominent differences between the patient subgroups were the frequency and burden of comorbidities: at least one comorbid condition was recorded for 100% of the trial-ineligible (74% CCI ≥ 1) and 70% of the trial-eligible patients (19% CCI ≥ 1). While the staging according to Durie Salmon was similar for both subgroups, more trial-ineligible patients were diagnosed in prognostic stage III according to the ISS criteria (32 vs 10%). 59% patients (65%) were classified as trial-ineligible due to one exclusion criterion, 23 patients (25%) met two exclusion criteria, eight patients (9%) met three, and one patient (1%) met four exclusion criteria.
