<p id="Par21">Our study addresses the recent demand for validation of results from clinical trials in the routine care setting [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We show that at least 30% of the patients in daily routine care would be deemed ineligible for clinical trials. Their first-line PFS and OS were inferior to those of potentially trial-eligible patients, while the survival times from these potentially trial-eligible patients were comparable to the survival times reported by clinical trials. The patient population selected for clinical trials specifically excludes patients with an inferior prognosis and thus data from prospective, multicentre, clinical registries like ours are of paramount importance to complement these data. In addition, clinical trials specifically addressing this commonly excluded comorbid group of patients are needed to develop optimised treatment strategies.
