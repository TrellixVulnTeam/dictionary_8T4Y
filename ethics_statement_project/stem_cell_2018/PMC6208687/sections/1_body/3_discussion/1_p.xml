<p id="Par16">Patients in clinical trials are highly selected and might not be representative of all patients with MM; thus, outcome results may not be conferrable to the routine clinical practice. Here, we present data from the prospective, multicentre, clinical registry TLN, showing that at least 30% of the non-transplant patients with MM would be deemed ineligible for clinical trials. These patients showed inferior survival, although the treatment algorithm was similar. This highlights the need for cohort studies with patients in routine care and for an individualised therapy coupled with recommendations for such an approach. For the potentially trial-eligible patients, outcome was similar to the survival data from clinical trials.</p>
