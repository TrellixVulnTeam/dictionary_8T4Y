<p id="Par2">Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell disorder and accounts for approximately 10% of all haematologic malignancies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Despite increasing treatment options, MM is considered incurable because most patients eventually relapse or become refractory to the treatment. 6510 new cases of MM have been recorded in Germany in 2014; their prognosis is rather unfavourable with a 5-year survival of 47% for women and 49% for men [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Upon diagnosis, eligibility for stem cell transplantation is determined by age, performance status, and comorbidities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. As MM is predominantly diagnosed at age 65 or greater, the majority of patients are not eligible for transplantation. Furthermore, due to the growing number of elderly individuals in our population, the number of elderly patients with malignancies continues to increase and treatment recommendations for elderly and transplant-ineligible patients are of growing interest.
