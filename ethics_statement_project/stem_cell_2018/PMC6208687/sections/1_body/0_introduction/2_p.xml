<p id="Par3">The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and the immunomodulatory drug thalidomide have changed the treatment algorithm for elderly patients. The combination therapies bortezomib, melphalan, prednisone (VMP) and melphalan, prednisone, and thalidomide (MPT) were standard of care for non-transplant patients during the study period [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. We previously analysed the first- and second-line treatment of non-transplant patients with MM in routine care in Germany and revealed that 40% of the patients received VMP and 8% MPT as first-line treatment in 2009 to 2011 [
