<p id="Par5">Here, we present data from the prospective cohort study TLN (tumour registry lymphatic neoplasms), which recruited a representative sample of non-transplant patients with MM from routine care in Germany. Aim of this study was to assess the potential eligibility of patients for clinical trials according to the presence of common exclusion criteria and to compare the treatment and the progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and disease-specific survival (DSS) of trial-ineligible with potentially trial-eligible patients.</p>
