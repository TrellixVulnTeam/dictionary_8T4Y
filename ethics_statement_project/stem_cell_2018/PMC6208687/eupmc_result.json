Median first-line progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of trial-ineligible patients were inferior to that of potentially trial-eligible patients: PFS 16.2\u00a0months (95% CI (confidence interval) 11.1-20.4) vs. 27.3\u00a0months (95% CI 23.3-33.0); OS 34.2\u00a0months (95% CI 21.6-48.1) vs. 58.6\u00a0months (95% CI 48.6-64.4).
