 <p id="Par1">One-hundred Mayo Clinic patients with high/intermediate-risk myelofibrosis (MF) received momelotinib (MMB; JAK1/2 inhibitor) between 2009 and 2010, as part of a phase 1/2 trial (NCT00935987); 73% harbored 
  <italic>JAK2</italic> mutations, 16% 
  <italic>CALR</italic>, 7% 
  <italic>MPL</italic>, 44% 
  <italic>ASXL1</italic>, and 18% 
  <italic>SRSF2</italic>. As of July 2017, MMB was discontinued in 91% of the patients, after a median treatment duration of 1.4 years. Grade 3/4 toxicity included thrombocytopenia (34%) and liver/pancreatic test abnormalities (&lt;10%); grade 1/2 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 47%. Clinical improvement (CI) occurred in 57% of patients, including 44% anemia and 43% spleen response. CI was more likely to occur in 
  <italic>ASXL1</italic>-unmutated patients (66% vs 44%) and in those with &lt;2% circulating blasts (66% vs 42%). Response was more durable in the presence of 
  <italic>CALR</italic> type 1/like and absence of very high-risk karyotype. In multivariable analysis, absence of 
  <italic>CALR</italic> type 1/like (HR 3.0; 95% CI 1.2–7.6) and presence of 
  <italic>ASXL1</italic> (HR 1.9; 95% CI 1.1–3.2) or 
  <italic>SRSF2</italic> (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3–4.5) mutations adversely affected survival. 
  <italic>SRSF2</italic> mutations (HR 4.7, 95% CI 1.3–16.9), very high-risk karyotype (HR 7.9, 95% CI 1.9–32.1), and circulating blasts ≥2% (HR 3.9, 95% CI 1.4–11.0) predicted leukemic transformation. Post-MMB survival (median 3.2 years) was not significantly different than that of a risk-matched MF cohort not receiving MMB.
