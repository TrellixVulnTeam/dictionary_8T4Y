<p id="Par9">In univariate analysis, 
 <italic>ASXL1</italic> and 
 <italic>SRSF2</italic> mutations, absence of 
 <italic>CALR</italic> type 1/like, unfavorable karyotype, circulating blasts ≥2%, older age, and the failure to achieve CI were all associated with inferior post-MMB survival (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 in all instances). In multivariable analysis not including response status, absence of 
 <italic>CALR</italic> type 1/like (HR 3.0, 95% CI 1.2–7.6) and presence of 
 <italic>ASXL1</italic> (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1–3.2) and 
 <italic>SRSF2</italic> (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3–4.5) mutations sustained their significance, along with age (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.006). Furthermore, the genetic markers remained significant even when CI status was included in the multivariable model: HRs (95% CI) were 2.4 (1.4–4.2) for 
 <italic>ASXL1</italic>/
 <italic>SRSF2</italic> mutations, 3.0 (1.2–7.7) for absence of 
 <italic>CALR</italic> type 1/like, and 0.37 (0.2–0.6) for CI. In both univariate and multivariable analysis, leukemia-free survival was adversely affected by 
 <italic>SRSF2</italic> mutations (HR 4.7, 95% CI 1.3–16.9), very high-risk karyotype (HR 7.9, 95% CI 1.9–32.1), and circulating blasts ≥2% (HR 3.9, 95% CI 1.4–11.0).
