<p id="Par12">The pathway towards regulatory approval of MMB appears to be uncertain, judging from the underwhelming performance of the drug in two recent randomized studies. In JAK2 inhibitor-na√Øve patients

 </sup>, MMB was compared to ruxolitinib and among patients completing 24 weeks of therapy, spleen response rates were similar (26.5% vs 29%) while anemia response rates were superior with MMB (transfusion-independence rate of 66.5% vs 49.3%) and symptoms response rates with ruxolitinib (42.2% vs 28.4%); grade 3/4 anemia occurred more frequently with ruxolitinib (23% vs 6%) while other AEs were reported to be similar. In the second phase 3 study of patients previously treated with ruxolitinib

 </sup>, MMB was compared to best available therapy (BAT); among patients completing 24 weeks of treatment, spleen responses were not impressive in both arms of the study (6.7% vs 5.8%) while anemia (transfusion-independence rate of 43.3% vs 21.2%) and symptoms response rates (26.2% vs 5.9%) were superior with MMB. Of note, in the latter study
