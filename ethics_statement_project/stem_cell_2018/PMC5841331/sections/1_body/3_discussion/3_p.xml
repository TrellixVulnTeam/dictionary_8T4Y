 </sup>. In this regard, the emphasis should be on peripheral neuropathy for MMB and anemia for ruxolitinib. Long-term use of ruxolitinib has also been associated with opportunistic infections, because of the immunosuppressive effects of the drug

 </sup>. Patients should not be misled regarding the disease-modifying activity MMB or other JAK2 inhibitors, and there is no consistent evidence that these drugs can reverse MF or induce cytogenetic or molecular remissions; the mechanism of action for this class of drugs has been attributed to non-specific suppression of inflammatory cytokines, which explains their salutary activity in other unrelated conditions

 </sup>. The current study underscores the transient nature of JAK2 inhibitor-induced palliation of symptoms in MF, as well as the limited effect on overall survival, which is instead primarily determined by the underlying molecular signature of the disease
