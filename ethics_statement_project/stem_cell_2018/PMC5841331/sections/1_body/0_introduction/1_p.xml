 </sup>, maximum tolerated dose was established at 300 mg/day and dose-limiting toxicity included grade 3 headache and hyperlipasemia. The particular phase 1/2 study included 166 patients treated at either 150 or 300 mg once-daily or 150 mg twice-daily for 9 months;

 </sup> study patients were enrolled between November 2009 and August 2011 and 165 patients received at least one dose of study drug. The particular study included 14% of patients previously exposed to another JAK2 inhibitor therapy. After median (range) treatment duration of 15.3 months (0.1–48.8), the overall response rate in the 166 patients multicenter study was 58% and included no complete remissions and only 1 partial remission and the drug did not affect the mutant 
 <italic>JAK2</italic> allele burden; anemia response was 59% and red cell transfusion-independency was achieved by 75% whereas palpable spleen response was reported at 40%. In terms of treatment-emergent drug toxicity, the most common grade 1/2 adverse events (AEs) included diarrhea, peripheral neuropathy and thrombocytopenia, and first-dose effect of hypotension, dizziness, nausea, headache, and flushing. The current study is limited to the subset of 100 patients treated with MMB at the Mayo Clinic; we provide a 7-year follow-up of patient data, which focuses on overall and leukemia-free survival, as well as the impact of driver and other mutations on response rates and overall, leukemia-free and relapse-free survival.
