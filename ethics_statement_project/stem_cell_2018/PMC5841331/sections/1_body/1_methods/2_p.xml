<p id="Par4">Statistical analyses considered clinical and laboratory parameters obtained at the time of MMB study entry. All statistical analyses considered clinical and laboratory parameters were obtained at the time of MMB study entry. Differences in the distribution of continuous variables between categories were analyzed by either Mann–Whitney or Kruskal–Wallis test. Patient groups with nominal variables were compared by chi-square test. Survival analysis was considered from the date of study entry to the date of death (uncensored) or last contact (censored). Patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT) were censored at the time of their transplant for survival analysis. Leukemia-free survival calculations considered the transformation event as the uncensored variable. Survival curves were prepared by the Kaplan–Meier method and compared by the log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for multivariable analysis. 
 <italic>p-</italic>Values less than 0.05 were considered significant. All analyses were conducted using the Stat View (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). In order to obtain preliminary information regarding the impact of MMB therapy on survival, we recruited a retrospective cohort of JAK inhibitor treatment-naïve patients, from our institutional databases, matched for their dynamic international prognostic scoring system (DIPSS-plus) risk status
