<p id="Par75">In conclusion, BTH1677 in combination with bevacizumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel as a first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC led to improvements in ORR, DOR, PFS, and OS compared with the Control arm. No major safety concerns were noted with the BTH1677 combination therapy. Ongoing studies are continuing to explore this novel PAMP immune modulator as an adjunct to antibody-based therapy, including checkpoint inhibitor therapies, for patients with NSCLC (NCT03003468) as well as other cancers (NCT02086175; NCT02981303).</p>
