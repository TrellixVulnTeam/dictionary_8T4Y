<p id="Par49">The primary objective was to evaluate the ORR (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) in each treatment arm. Secondary objectives included assessment of best response rate (CR, PR, or stable disease [SD] rates), disease control rate (DCR; CR + PR + SD), duration of objective tumor response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in each treatment arm. Safety within each arm and the PK profile of BTH1677 were also evaluated.</p>
