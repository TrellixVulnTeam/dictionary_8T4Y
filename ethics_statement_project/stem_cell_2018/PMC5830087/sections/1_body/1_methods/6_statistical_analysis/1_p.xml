<p id="Par59">The analysis populations for the blinded central radiology tumor assessments, safety and survival analyses, and PK analyses are shown by treatment arm in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The analysis population for tumor assessments (primary efficacy population) was comprised of all randomized patients who received any amount of bevacizumab, carboplatin, or paclitaxel, with or without BTH1677, and who had an evaluable baseline CT scan assessment and at least 1 evaluable post-baseline CT scan assessment. The safety and survival populations were comprised of all randomized patients who received any amount of study drugs. The PK population was comprised of all patients who had at least 75% of the PK measurements available for any particular treatment cycle data set. The primary analysis data lock (which included all analyses except final OS) occurred on 21 March 2014. Data lock for final survival analysis occurred on 16 March 2016, which was approximately 3 years after the randomization date of the last patient enrolled into the study.
