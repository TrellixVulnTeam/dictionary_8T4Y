<p id="Par58">Post-dosing blood samples were collected for PK assessments for BTH1677 on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 3. Samples for BTH1677 trough level assessments were also obtained before weekly dosing on all other weeks of Cycles 1 and 2, as well as prior to dosing of Cycle 3, Day 1. Serum BTH1677 levels were measured by a beta-glucan specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) developed at Biothera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which had a lower limit of detection of 1.2 ng/mL and a lower limit of quantitation of 4.7 ng/mL. Serum PK parameters were calculated using noncompartmental analysis (NCA) with NCA in WinNonlin® v5.2.</p>
