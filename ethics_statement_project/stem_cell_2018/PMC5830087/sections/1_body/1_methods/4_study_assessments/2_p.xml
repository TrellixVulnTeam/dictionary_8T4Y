<p id="Par57">Tumor response assessments were based on computed tomography (CT) scans performed every other cycle (i.e., at 6-week intervals). Blinded central radiology reviews were performed with tumor response assessed using a modified RECIST v1.0 criteria in which an initial response did not require a repeat assessment at a later time period for confirmation. All other RECIST v1.0 criteria were unmodified.</p>
