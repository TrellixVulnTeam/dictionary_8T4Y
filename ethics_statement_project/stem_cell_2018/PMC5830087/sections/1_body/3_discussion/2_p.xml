<p id="Par72">Previously the ECOG and AVAiL trials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] evaluated clinical outcomes when bevacizumab was added to a platinum-based chemotherapy backbone in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC in a first-line setting. In particular, the ECOG study evaluated the same chemotherapy backbone of carboplatin and paclitaxel as our current study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In this randomized, open-label, phase II study, ORR, DOR, PFS, and OS were higher in patients receiving BTH1677 in combination with bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel compared with patients receiving bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel alone. As statistical significance was not achieved in any of the assessments, all results should be interpreted carefully. As a phase II study, its main goal was to better define the point estimates and variability of the efficacy parameters to be used for statistical design in a later registrational trial. The consistent positive trend across multiple clinical endpoints suggests a benefit with the addition of BTH1677 to bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel and is consistent with synergistic effects seen with preclinical in vivo studies with BTH1677 added to bevacizumab therapy in murine lung cancer models [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It should also be noted that the Control arm in this trial performed similarly to, or better than, the bevacizumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel arm in the ECOG 4599 study (ECOG ORR 35% vs our 43.5%; ECOG PFS 6.2 months vs our 9.6 months; ECOG OS 12.3 months vs our 11.6 months), giving credibility to the further improvements of 60.4%, 11.6 months, and 16.1 months observed for these respective endpoints with the addition of BTH1677.
