 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] (PD-1/PD-L1 CPIs) have been approved for various stages of NSCLC. In early-phase studies, these agents are also being evaluated in combination with anti-angiogenic agents, including bevacizumab (with and without concomitant chemotherapy), with results pending [
