<p id="Par73">The most frequently reported AE system organ classes were blood and lymphatic system disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and general disorders/administration site conditions, which are consistent with AE classes typically associated with the underlying disease and/or the backbone therapy. Although an overall higher incidence of Grade 3 or Grade 4 AEs was reported in the BTH1677 arm than the Control arm, fewer patients in the BTH1677 arm than in the Control arm discontinued therapy due to AEs. It has subsequently been observed in ongoing cancer trials that infusion reactions may be associated with BTH1677 administration in some patients and may consist of various constellations of transient fever/chills, headache, dyspnea/cough, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, back pain, and myalgia/arthralgia; such events were observed at Grade 3 levels and contributed to the overall higher incidence of Grade 3 or Grade 4 AEs in the BTH1677 arm of this trial. Fatal AEs reported in the BTH1677 arm were generally associated with progression of disease. Overall, these safety findings further support a safety profile for BTH1677, which is consistent with our previous reports with BTH1677 alone [
