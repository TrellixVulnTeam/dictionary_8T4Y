<p id="Par44">Approximately 85% of all lung cancers are classified as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the majority of patients present with locally advanced or metastatic disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Despite significant advances in NSCLC therapies, first-line treatment options for patients with advanced NSCLC still remain limited. Traditional platinum-based chemotherapy is still a mainstay therapy for most patients; however, this treatment approach generally provides only a short-lived benefit [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. More recently, targeted therapies (eg, those targeting epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] gene mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK] translocations) have produced superior effects compared with chemotherapies for first-line management of advanced mutated NSCLC, but only small specific subtypes of NSCLC patients benefit from such treatments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Several monoclonal antibody (MAb) therapies have also been approved for first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC, including bevacizumab (approved for non-squamous only), which targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]; necitumumab (approved for squamous only) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which targets EGFR; and most recently, pembrolizumab, which targets the programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint receptor on cytotoxic T cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Additional MAbs approved for second-line therapy, but possibly moving to front-line therapy, include ramucirumab [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which targets VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), as well as the anti-PD-1 and anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) MAbs, nivolumab [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and atezolizumab [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], respectively.
