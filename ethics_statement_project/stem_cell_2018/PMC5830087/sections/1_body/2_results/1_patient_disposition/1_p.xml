<p id="Par61">Between 29 September 2009 and 08 March 2013, a total of 92 patients with NSCLC were randomly assigned 2:1 to the BTH1677 or the Control arm. As shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, 59 patients in the BTH1677 arm and 30 patients in the Control arm were treated and included in the safety and survival analyses. The blinded central radiology review primary efficacy population included 50 patients (48 patients response evaluable) in the BTH1677 arm and 23 patients in the Control arm. The primary reason for patient exclusion from the primary efficacy population was that an evaluable baseline or post-baseline CT scan was not available or acceptable to the central radiology reviewers. The primary reason for treatment discontinuation in each arm was disease progression (BTH1677, 45.9%; Control, 41.9%).
