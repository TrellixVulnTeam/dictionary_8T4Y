<p id="Par65">The OS Kaplan-Meier curves for the BTH1677 and Control arms are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. The median OS of patients in the BTH1677 arm was 16.1 months (95% CI: 11.4, 20.8) compared with 11.6 months (95% CI: 7.7, 22.3) in the Control arm. However, the difference in median OS was not statistically significant between arms (HR 0.75 [95% CI: 0.45, 1.28];
