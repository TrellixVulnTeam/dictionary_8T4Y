<p id="Par63">Tumor-associated assessments were based on the blinded central radiology review of the primary efficacy population. Although the between-group difference was not statistically significant, compared with the Control arm, patients in the BTH1677 arm had a higher ORR (60.4% vs 43.5%; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .2096) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). One patient in the BTH1677 arm had a CR while no patients in the Control arm had CR (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). While on maintenance therapy, continued reduction in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions of &gt; 20 mm and &gt; 10 mm, respectively, occurred in 7% and 20% of the BTH1677 arm patients, but in none of the Control arm patients (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). One of these continued reductions included a BTH1677 arm patient who had a CR at treatment week 47 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>); this patient remained in the study with a CR for an additional 19 weeks until the study was closed for primary analysis.
