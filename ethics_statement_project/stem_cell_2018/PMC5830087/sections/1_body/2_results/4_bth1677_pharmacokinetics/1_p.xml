<p id="Par70">BTH1677 serum concentrations in both cycles were above the limit of quantitation (4.7 ng/mL) for all but 1 patient. Individual t
 <sub>max</sub> values generally coincided with the end of infusion or shortly thereafter. Mean serum trough levels of BTH1677 appeared to plateau as of Day 15 of Cycle 1, suggesting that steady state was achieved as of Day 15. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> summarizes the PK parameters of BTH1677 from Cycle 1/Day 1 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 53) and Cycle 3/Day 1 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 42). Geometric mean C
 <sub>max</sub> of serum BTH1677 was similar in Cycle 1 (49.77 μg/mL) and Cycle 3 (60.50 μg/mL). AUC
 <sub>0-24</sub> of BTH1677 was also similar in Cycle 1 (399.8 μg•hr./mL) and Cycle 3 (464.4 μg•hr./mL), with little to no accumulation of BTH1677 being observed. No notable difference in other PK parameters (CL, t
 <sub>max</sub>, and V
 <sub>ss</sub>) between Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 were observed. A longer elimination half-life (t
 <sub>1/2</sub>) was observed in Cycle 1 (17.56 h) than Cycle 3 (7.17 h); however, these results should be interpreted with caution given the difference in sampling periods between Cycle 1 (up to 168 h post dosing) and Cycle 3 (only up to 24 h post dosing).
