<p id="Par66">All patients receiving any treatment (BTH1677 
 <italic>n</italic> = 59; Control 
 <italic>n</italic> = 30) were included in the safety population, and the majority of these patients (≥98%) experienced at least 1 AE. Grade 3 or Grade 4 AEs occurred at a higher incidence among patients in the BTH1677 arm compared with patients in the Control arm (93.2% vs 66.7%, respectively). However, the incidence of serious AEs (40.7% vs 43.3%) and AEs leading to discontinuation (35.6% vs 40%) was slightly lower in the BTH1677 arm than the Control arm, respectively. In the BTH1677 arm, 22.0% and 28.8% of the AEs were considered probably and possibly related to BTH1677, respectively. These data are summarized in Table
