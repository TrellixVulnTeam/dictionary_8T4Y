This phase II study explored the efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and safety of BTH1677 combined with bevacizumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients with untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS:Patients were randomized to the BTH1677 arm (N\u2009=\u200961; intravenous [IV] BTH1677, 4\u00a0mg/kg, weekly; IV bevacizumab, 15\u00a0mg/kg, once each 3-week cycle [Q3W]; IV carboplatin, 6\u00a0mg/mL/min Calvert formula area-under-the-curve, Q3W; and IV paclitaxel, 200\u00a0mg/m2, Q3W) or Control arm (N\u2009=\u200931; bevacizumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel as above). Carboplatin/paclitaxel was discontinued after 4-6\u00a0cycles and patients who responded or remained stable received maintenance therapy with BTH1677/bevacizumab (BTH1677 arm) or bevacizumab (Control arm). Efficacy assessments, based on blinded central radiology review, included objective response rate (ORR; primary endpoint), disease control rate, duration of objective response, and progression-free survival. Overall survival and adverse events (AEs) were also assessed. RESULTS:ORR was higher in the BTH1677 vs Control arm but the difference between groups was not statistically significant (60.4% vs 43.5%; P\u2009=\u2009.2096). All other clinical endpoints also favored the BTH1677 arm but none statistically differed between arms. PK was consistent with previous studies. Although a higher incidence of Grade 3/4 AEs occurred in the BTH1677 vs Control arm (93.2% vs 66.7%), no unexpected AEs were observed. Serious AEs and discontinuations due to AEs were lower in the BTH1677 vs Control arm.
