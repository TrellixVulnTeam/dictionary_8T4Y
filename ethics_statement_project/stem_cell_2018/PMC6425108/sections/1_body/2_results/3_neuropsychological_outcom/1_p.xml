<p>Neuropsychological scores are shown in 
 <xref rid="table5-0963689718820271" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. At baseline, cognitive performance was normal for all patients, with the exception of P3 whose performance was mildly affected. After surgery their cognitive assessments 1, 2, and 4 years post-surgery were satisfactory for all patients, and showed only minor variations if at all. With regards to their affective assessments, patients were only minimally depressed (patient 2 showed moderate score) throughout the 4-year post-surgery study period but did show mild to severe levels of anxiety which remained unchanged for most patients after surgery, with the exceptions of patients P5 and P6 who appear to have improved, and patient P7 whose anxiety went from mild at baseline to severe 2 years and decreased back to mild 4 years after surgery.
