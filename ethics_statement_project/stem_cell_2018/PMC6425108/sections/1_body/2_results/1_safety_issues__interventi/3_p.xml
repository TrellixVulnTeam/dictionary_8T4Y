<p>Immunogenicity: In the serological assay, the highest percent NPC-specific antibody reaction at baseline was observed in P7 at 12%. Most of the patients showed similar or lower levels of response at 1 month (while on immunosuppressants) and 6 months (off immunosuppressants) post-implantation, with none exceeding 12% (
