<p>Therefore, we believe it is important to broaden the scope of PD cell therapy by grafting undifferentiated cells that might differentiate into various cell types at various diseased sites of PD brains and improve function in PD patients beyond dopamine. Undifferentiated stem cells are, by definition, more plastic than pre-differentiated ones and are able to tune their proliferation and vector of differentiation in response to micro-environmental cues

 </sup>. These qualities of undifferentiated cells may allow them to address dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic aspects of the disease, as well as to avoid misdosing the patients. In addition, unlike undifferentiated cells of embryonic origin, neural progenitor cells (NPCs) do not produce teratomas in immunocompromised animals in the standard teratoma assay
