 </sup> into the caudate or putamen of PD patients are among the attempted treatments. These approaches aimed to replace degenerated dopaminergic neurons, ameliorate motor function disturbances, and enhance cognitive abilities. However, all of the above treatments resulted in only moderate improvement that could not justify large surgical volume and related clinical risks and complications of these procedures. Moreover, it was shown that robust graft survival and normalized dopaminergic innervation did not result in clinical improvement in a PD patient
