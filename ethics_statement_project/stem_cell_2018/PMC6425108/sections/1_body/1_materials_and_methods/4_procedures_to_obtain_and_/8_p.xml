<p>Prior to implantation, a WCB vial was thawed, cells washed with culture medium, counted, resuspended in culture medium at a concentration of 1×10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/ml and tested for viability (0.4% trypan blue stain; MP Biomedicals LLC, Santa Ana, CA, USA), gram stain, and endotoxin. Viability of &gt;80%, negative gram stain, and endotoxin &lt;3EU/ml were required for release. A portion of the final formulation was submitted to sterility (USP &lt;71&gt;) and mycoplasma (USP &lt;63&gt;) testing (results were available after implantation). Cell suspension at 2×10
 <sup>6</sup> cells in 2 ml of culture medium per vial were shipped overnight in a temperature controlled (2–8°C) container (Pelican BioThermal, Plymouth, MN USA). Temperature inside the container was continuously recorded and checked for deviations prior to implantation. Viability was tested again immediately prior to surgery, and was consistently higher than 90%. After surgery a sample of the remaining cell suspension was submitted to sterility testing (USP &lt;71&gt;).
