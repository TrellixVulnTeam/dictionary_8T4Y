<p>Human fetal brain tissue was procured via routine sterile manual aspiration. Maternal blood samples (sera) were tested for: HIV (LabCorp, San Diego, USA) hepatitis A, B and C (LabCorp, San Diego, USA); HTLVI (LabCorp, San Diego, USA); VRDL Serum w/Reflex Titer (LabCorp, San Diego, CA, USA) and cytomegalovirus (LabCorp, San Diego, CA, USA). Potential donors with a history of genital herpes, cancer, asthma, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, allergies, vasculitis of autoimmune origin, and drug abuse were excluded. Gestation was determined according to Carnegie stages. Fetal tissue was harvested at the sixth week of gestation after elective abortion. Whole fetal forebrain was dissected, minced, and triturated to a single cell suspension and cryopreserved. Cell suspension samples were thawed, expanded, and cultured in flasks incubated at 37Â°C under hypoxic conditions (5% O
 <sub>2</sub> and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>) through four doublings, and characterized in 2012.
