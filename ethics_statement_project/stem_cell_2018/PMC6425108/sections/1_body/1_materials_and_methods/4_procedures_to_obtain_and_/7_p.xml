<p>Tumorigenicity of the WCB cells was investigated via a teratoma assay. Briefly, 3 million cells were subcutaneously injected into the flanks of Beige SCID mice. The subject animals have severe immunodeficiency affecting both B and T lymphocytes and are permissive to tumor formation. The mice were monitored for visible tumor formation, changes in vital signs and weight; 12 weeks after stem cell injections, the mice were euthanized and autopsied. The site of the injection, brain, and filtration organs (lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, and lymph nodes) underwent gross and histological examination for presence of tumors. No tumors were found in any of the animals.</p>
