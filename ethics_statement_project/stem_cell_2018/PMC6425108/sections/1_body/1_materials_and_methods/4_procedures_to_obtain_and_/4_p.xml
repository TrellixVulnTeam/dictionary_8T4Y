<p>At the second doubling (D2) cell culture was tested for sterility (USP &lt;71&gt;) and at D4 culture was karyotyped (Cell Line Genetics, Madison, WI, USA) and PCR tested for presence of adventitious agents: HTLV-1, HTLV-2, HIV-1 (A, B, D, F, H, N), hepatitis A, B and C, 
 <italic>T. p. pallidum</italic>, CMV, HSV-1, HSV-2, HPV. Cells were then transferred to a closed bioreactor system (GE WAVE Bioreactor 2/10 System, Uppsala, Sweden), operating under the same physical and chemical conditions. The bioreactor was used to create the master cell bank (MCB), which was harvested, tested, characterized, and rate-control cryopreserved after a total of seven doublings (D7). After the MCB was safety tested and characterized, a portion of the batch was thawed and used to seed the bioreactor to produce the working cell bank (WCB). Cells were cultured in the bioreactor until they reached D13. They were harvested (Centritech LAB-III, CarrCentritech Separation System, Rancho Cucamonga, CA, USA), aliquoted (Fill-It; TAP Biosystems, Wilmington, DE, USA), and cryopreserved.
