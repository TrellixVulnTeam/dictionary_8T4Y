<p>The WCB was subjected to release testing for safety and characterization assays. Safety testing included sterility (USP &lt;71&gt;), mycoplasma (USP &lt;63&gt;), endotoxin (USP &lt;85&gt;), and karyotyping. Characterization included flow cytometry testing for: Oct-4 &gt;90% (10H11.2, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA; AF488 conjugated), Sox-2 &gt;90% (Btjce, eBioscience, San Diego CA, USA; AF488 conjugated), MHC-I &lt;10% (A4, eBioscience; APC conjugated), MHC-II &lt;10% (CVS20, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA; AF488 conjugated), CD105 &lt;10% (SN6, eBioscience; PE-Cy7 conjugated), and tyrosine hydroxylase &lt;10% (EP1532Y, Abcam, Cambridge, UK; FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG; Abcam; polyclonal). Both MCB and WCB were stored in gas phase liquid nitrogen (LN
 <sub>2</sub>).
