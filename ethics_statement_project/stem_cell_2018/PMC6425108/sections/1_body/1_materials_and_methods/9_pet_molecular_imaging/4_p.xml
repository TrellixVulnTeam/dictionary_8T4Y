<p>Images were reconstructed using an OSEM-2D algorithm and analyzed with the Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM v.12). Each individual PET brain image was normalized on an anatomical MRI atlas to be evaluated within a standard space. Following normalization, FSL structural atlases were used to define regions of interest. To facilitate quantitative analysis, specific uptake ratios in the caudate and putamen were calculated by subtracting the background signal of a reference region with nonspecific uptake from striatal activity, and dividing the result by reference region activity, that is [(target uptake â€“ reference uptake)/reference uptake], using cerebellum for RAC, and occipital cortex for DTBZ and FDOPA, as reference regions.</p>
