 </sup> and thus was a concern with this trial. At their 12-month follow-ups none of our seven fully evaluated patients have shown graft-induced dyskinesias. In fact, the only one of our patients who showed painful drug-induced dyskinesias at the onset of this trial, namely P5, at her 2-year follow-up, is now mostly free of this symptom. It is possible to speculate that, unlike fetal dopaminergic neurons

 </sup> or the embryonic-derived differentiated neurons, our NPCs not only enhance putaminal dopaminergic neurotransmission where it is necessary but might down-regulate it in dyskinetic patients (UPDRS-IV).
