<p>The fact that, 4 years after surgery, six out of seven patients improved their UPDRS III scores as compared with their baseline, allows us to suggest that the NPCs can either arrest or reverse the progression of PD. A certain deterioration 2 years after surgery as compared with the first year results can be interpreted as a sign of fading effect. However, reversal of the second-year deterioration as compared with the first year by the fourth year can indicate that the restorative mechanisms of NPCs require longer time to fully materialize their potential.</p>
