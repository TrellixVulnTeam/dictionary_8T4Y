<p>The primary functional outcome tested here was patient motor performance. With one exception, all patients showed motor function improvements in the first year post-surgery which further continued to improve in three cases by their 2-year follow-up (P4, P5, and P6), while the other three still showed improvements, albeit diminished, but better than at baseline. In the fourth year these results remained practically unchanged while patients 2, 6, and 7 improved as compared with both baseline and the second year after surgery.</p>
