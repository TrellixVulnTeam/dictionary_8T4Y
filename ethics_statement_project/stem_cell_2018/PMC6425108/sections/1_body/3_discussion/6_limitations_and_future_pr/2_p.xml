<p>We are fully aware that an effective PD therapy will require the replacement not only of dopaminergic, but also of non-dopaminergic (serotoninergic, cholinergic, and noradrenergic) innervations that contribute to PD pathology

 </sup>, which is precisely the reason why we have chosen undifferentiated NPCs for brain grafting to treat PD. In the future, we intend to determine if the NPC cell line tested here is able to migrate purposefully to other affected areas of diseased PD brains, besides the striatum, to restore not only motor, but also non-motor functions, and perhaps even support neuroprotection
