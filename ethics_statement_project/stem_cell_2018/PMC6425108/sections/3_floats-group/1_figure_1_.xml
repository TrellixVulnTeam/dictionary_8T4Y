  <p>Lack of immune response to NPC grafting. A. In the serological assay, no increase in NPC-specific antibodies was detected at 1 month (on immunosuppressants) or 6 months (off immunosuppressants) after bilateral putaminal stem cell injections, compared with baseline. B. In the cytotoxicity assay, P3 and P7 demonstrated somewhat higher levels of cell lysis at 6 and 1 month post-grafting, respectively, compared with their baselines, but these values were still lower than the highest pre-operative baseline observed (P1). BLQ, below level of quantification.</p>
