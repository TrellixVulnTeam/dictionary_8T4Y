<p id="Par9">In order to determine if sertraline exposure promoted scar formation instead of bone remodelling due to negative effects on osteoclast (TRAP) or osteoblast (ALP) activity, immunohistochemical analyses were performed. Sertraline exposure was found to significantly diminish TRAP activity (

 <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">8</xref>) or apoptosis (Caspase; Fig.
