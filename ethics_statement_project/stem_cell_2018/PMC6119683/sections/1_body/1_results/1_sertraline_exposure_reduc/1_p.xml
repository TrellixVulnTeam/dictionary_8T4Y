<p id="Par6">No significant differences in weight were observed due to sertraline exposure (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> illustrates representative micro-computed tomography (µCT) reconstructions for each group. Analysis of the amount of calvarial defect regeneration and/or mineralization showed that sertraline-exposed animals had reduced bone healing within the defect site at the 4-week post-operative time point. This finding was especially striking in the groups where osteogenesis was driven by administration of the growth factor BMP2. Of the animals exposed to sertraline, the average circulating serum level at sacrifice was (123.42 ± 29.91), mimicking human circulating steady-state levels, and there was no significant difference between surgical groups (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.204; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). A natural log transformation was performed to normalize percent healing data for statistical analysis. It was found that BMP2-treated animals had significantly greater healing than the sham and scaffold-only groups (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.05, respectively). Sertraline-exposed animals showed an approximate 10% decrease in percent healing within the defect for the matrix and BMP2-treated groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). After a square root transformation, µCT analysis showed that the BV/TV parameter closely aligned with the percent healing, and the BMP2-treated groups had greater bone volume than the sham or scaffold-only groups (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.003, respectively). The increase in BMP2-driven bone volume appeared to be inhibited with exposure to sertraline, but the difference was not statistically significant (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.087; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>).
