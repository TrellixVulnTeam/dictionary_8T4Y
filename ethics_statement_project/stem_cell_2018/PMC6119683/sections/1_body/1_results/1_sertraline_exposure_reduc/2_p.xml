<p id="Par7">Further assessment of the regenerated bone within the defects demonstrated a significant decrease in trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) with sertraline exposure (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Due to a violation of normality, a rank transformation was performed for the variable trabecular separation (Tb.Sp). A significant interaction term for sertraline exposure by surgical group was observed (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). This result appears to be due to a large increase in Tb.Sp for the BMP2-treated groups, while no difference was found in the sham or scaffold surgical groups. A trend for greater Tb.Sp for sertraline-exposed animals was demonstrated but was not statistically significant (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.108); there was no significant difference by surgical group (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.255) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). However, there was a significant difference in trabecular number (Tb.N) by sertraline exposure, with exposed animals having significantly lower Tb.N (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.035; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>). To analyse Tb.N, an inverse transformation was performed to allow for homogeneity of variance and normality. There was a significant interaction term for sertraline exposure by surgical group (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.004) due to a large increase in Tb.N in the BMP2 group. In comparison, no difference between exposure was found in the sham and scaffold surgical groups. H&amp;E histological representations of the reduced healing in sertraline-exposed animals can be found in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref> (and Supplementary Fig.
