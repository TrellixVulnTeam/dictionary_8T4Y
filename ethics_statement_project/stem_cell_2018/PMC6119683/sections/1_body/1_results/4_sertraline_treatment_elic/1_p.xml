<p id="Par10">To determine the direct effect of sertraline treatment on the function of specific cell types contained within the calvaria, C2C12 (fibroblast phenotype), BMSCs (bone marrow-derived stem cells), E1s (mouse calvarial pre-osteoblasts), and primary calvarial cells were treated with control (no dose), low, and high doses of sertraline. E1 cells were shown to have a varied response to sertraline treatment between 3 and 7 days, with decreased proliferation at 3 days and a significant increase in proliferation by 7 days compared to controls (
