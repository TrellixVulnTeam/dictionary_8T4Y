<p id="Par11">To investigate the potential mechanism by which sertraline treatment impairs healing, histological analysis on the bioavailability of serotonin (5HT) and its transporter, TG2 (tissue transglutaminase), within the defect site was performed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, c</xref> and Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">10</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">11</xref>). Control animals had significantly higher levels of 5HT within the defect site compared to exposed animals (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). The levels of TG2 did not differ significantly between the exposed and non-exposed animals; however, there was an observed decrease in TG2 with sertraline exposure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Analysis of the gene expression of the enzymes involved in serotonin metabolism (
 <italic>Tph1</italic> and 
 <italic>Tph2</italic> or tryptophan hydroxylase) and the cell surface receptor of serotonin (
 <italic>Slc6a4</italic> or solute carrier family 6 member 4) in both isotype cells and isolated calvarial WT cells showed that 
 <italic>Tph2</italic> was not present in any of the cell types, and C2C12 cells did not amplify 
 <italic>Tph1, Tph2</italic> or 
 <italic>Slc6a4</italic>. However, at 7 days, E1s and BMSCs showed downregulation of 
 <italic>Tph1</italic>, while WT cells showed significant upregulation with high-dose sertraline. Following the same pattern, E1 and BMSC cells had downregulated 
 <italic>Slc6a4</italic> with sertraline treatment, while there was an observed upregulation in WT cells at 7 days. To determine if sertraline treatment affected collagen gene expression, 
 <italic>Col1a1</italic> and 
 <italic>Col1a2</italic> (genes encoding the pro-alpha chains) were investigated in our cell types. We found that E1s significantly downregulated 
 <italic>Co1a1</italic> and that C2C12 cells significantly downregulated both 
 <italic>Col1a1</italic> and 
 <italic>Col1a2</italic> at 7 days with low- and high-dose sertraline treatment (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). BMSC and WT cells showed no significant difference in the gene expression of 
 <italic>Col1a1</italic> or 
 <italic>Col1a2</italic> with sertraline treatment.
