 </sup> more recent information suggests that SSRI use by patients without mental health disorders, particularly those with vasomotor disorders, also leads to increased fracture risk, further highlighting a possible link between SSRIs and decreases in bone health.

 </sup> While clinical correlations between SSRI treatment and negative bone phenotypes have been established, research concerning SSRI use and bone health has only recently been extended to specific effects on bone wound healing, where it was found that fluoxetine negatively affected limb fracture healing.
