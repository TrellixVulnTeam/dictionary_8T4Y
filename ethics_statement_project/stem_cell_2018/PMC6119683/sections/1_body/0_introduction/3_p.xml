<p id="Par4">SSRI use presents an additional possible complication to craniofacial bone wound healing. Craniofacial injuries are the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in individuals under 45 years of age,

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup> accounting for over 20 million visits to the emergency room each year. The increased long-term use of SSRIs creates a concern for the recovery period after injury or iatrogenic craniofacial surgery,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup> since large defects in the calvarium are known to present with inadequate healing.

 </sup> Such wounds are already compromised and often require multiple clinical interventions, including grafts and/or growth factor therapies.

 </sup> Further evidence in a recent cohort study found that SSRI use results in higher rates of dental implant failure: 10.6% compared to 4.6% for non-SSRI users.
 <sup>

 </sup> This is a significant finding, as an estimated 69% of adults between 35 and 44 years of age have lost at least one permanent tooth, and by the age of 74, 26% of adults will have lost all of their permanent dentition.

 </sup> The association between dental implant failure and SSRI use points to impaired osseointegration of the implants, which has a concomitant increase in fracture risk associated with failure.
