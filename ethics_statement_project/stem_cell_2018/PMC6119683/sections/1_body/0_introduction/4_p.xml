<p id="Par5">Due to the current frequent use of SSRIs, these patient populations are at undue risk of potential negative effects on bone healing. In this study, we aim to test the hypothesis that the SSRI drug sertraline impairs acute bone wound healing and/or the quality of the regenerated bone in order to determine if sertraline use has a direct effect on bone healing. We are utilizing an established preclinical calvarial fracture model to test the effects of sertraline use in concurrence with a simulated clinical intervention using the growth factor therapy bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2).

 </sup> These results will provide a first step for clinical translation to vulnerable populations and may inform clinical interventions for fracture healing.
