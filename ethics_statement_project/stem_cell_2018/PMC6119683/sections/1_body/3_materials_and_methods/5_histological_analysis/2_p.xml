<p id="Par25">Immunohistochemistry representative samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) were incubated with the following primary antibodies: PCNA, a proliferation marker (AbCam, Cambridge, MA, ab18197, 1:3 000); ALP, an osteoblast marker (AbCam ab108337, 1:250); Active Caspase 3, an apoptosis marker (Ab2302, 1:75); tissue transglutaminase, a serotonin transporter (TG2; Covalab, Villeurbanne, France, PAB0024, 1:100); and 5-hydroxytryptamine, serotonin (5HT; LSBio, Seattle, WA, USA LS-B7118, 1:100). Samples were compared at the defect site for percent positivity of the targets of interest using ImageJ Software and the IHC Profiler Open Source Plugin for automated scoring of immunohistochemical staining.
