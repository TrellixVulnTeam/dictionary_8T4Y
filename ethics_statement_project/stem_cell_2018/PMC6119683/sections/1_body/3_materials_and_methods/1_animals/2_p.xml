The mice were sacrificed at 4 weeks post surgery, at which point the skulls were collected and subjected to radiography, micro-computed tomography (µCT) and histological analysis. Serum was also collected at the time of  sacrifice for systemic sertraline detection. Sacrifice was performed by asphyxiation using CO
