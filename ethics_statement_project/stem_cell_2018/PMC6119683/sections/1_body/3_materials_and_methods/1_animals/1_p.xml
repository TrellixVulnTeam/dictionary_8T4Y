<p id="Par19">Eight-week-old C57BL6 male mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were treated with 10 mg·kg
 <sup>-1</sup> sertraline (InvaGen, Hauppauge, NY) in drinking water (
 <italic>n</italic> = 26) or normal drinking water (
 <italic>n</italic> = 30) for 2 weeks prior to the surgeries, and treatment was continued until killing. The animals were randomized into three surgical groups: (a) empty defect/sham to show normal bone healing with no surgical intervention; (b) implanted with 4-mm DermaMatrix scaffold (Synthes, West Chester, PA, USA; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 20) soak-loaded with sterile PBS to elucidate if the matrix itself has osteoconductive properties; or (c) 4-mm DermaMatrix scaffold soak-loaded with 542.5 ng BMP2 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 18) to represent the clinical intervention. A critical-sized calvarial defect was then performed as previously described.

 </sup> Briefly, the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (Bethlehem, PA, USA), and a midline scalp incision was used to expose and remove the periosteum. A 5-mm craniectomy defect was trephinated using a slow-speed hand drill. Each craniectomy defect was filled with the assigned treatment above. The incision was then sutured closed with 6 × 0 polypropylene suture.
