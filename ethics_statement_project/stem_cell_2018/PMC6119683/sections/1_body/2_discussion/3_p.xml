<p id="Par14">We found that the observed decrease in bone healing during sertraline exposure was partially due to the negative effects of the sertraline on osteoclast function. Significant declines in TRAP-positive cells within the defect site indicate that the sertraline decreased osteoclast function, thereby reducing the ability of bone to regenerate due to reduced removal of fractured and dead bone within the defect site. As there was no difference in the rate of apoptosis in treated animals, the lack of TRAP-positive cells is not likely due to sertraline-driven apoptosis of osteoclasts at this time point, but perhaps is a direct effect on osteoclast function. Ortuno et al. demonstrated that fluoxetine treatment inhibits osteoclast differentiation and function through a Ca
