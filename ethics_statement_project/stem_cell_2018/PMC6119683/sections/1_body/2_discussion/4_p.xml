<p id="Par15">Our cell cultures also corroborate this paradigm, showing decreased apoptosis and increased proliferation for the pre-osteoblast population treated with sertraline. These findings differ from the results of a recent study by Bradaschia-Correa et al., who found that fluoxetine treatment inhibited proliferation, osteoblast differentiation and mineralization within an appendicular skeletal defect model.

 </sup> These contrasting findings could be attributed to varying mechanisms of action between the SSRI drugs or to the fact that cells from the cranium and the appendicular skeleton differ in origin, thereby affecting their response to extrinsic factors. While sertraline was not shown to have a direct negative effect on the function or viability of osteoblasts, the ability of the cells to create mineralized bone is dependent on an organized matrix, which is lacking in the sertraline-exposed animals. This uncoupling of osteoclast/osteoblast function could explain the lack of organization of the regenerate within the defect site of treated animals.
