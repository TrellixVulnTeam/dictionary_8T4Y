<p id="Par16">The concept that serotonin may play a direct role in bone health is not a new one,

 </sup> as research has examined the neural, gut, and skeletal health-related effects of serotonin. The focus has been placed on the presence and modulation of serotonin receptors, the serotonin transporter and direct and indirect effects of serotonin-modulating drugs, SSRIs, on bone and bone cells.

 </sup> Little resolution for these effects has been reached. Not surprisingly, the presence of serotonin can certainly affect the skeleton through proposed bone-related molecular pathways, including WNT

 </sup> Furthermore, both positive and negative effects on bone cells have been observed, suggesting that homoeostasis of this amino acid derivative is key. Alterations, particularly through pharmacological targeting of serotonin synthesis, may result in changes to the hard tissues in both normal remodelling processes as well as in healing.
