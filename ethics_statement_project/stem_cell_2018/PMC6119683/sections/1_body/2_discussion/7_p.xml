<p id="Par18">In conclusion, our study suggests that sertraline exposure alters bone healing largely by enhancing collagen formation while subsequently hampering cartilage formation and osteoclast function that would facilitate normal bone formation. Of the resulting bone contained within the defect, the organization and structure are negatively impacted, indicating the compromised quality of the remodelled bone with sertraline treatment. As use of SSRIs continues to increase globally, this study provides important preclinical information concerning the disruptive effects of sertraline treatment on bone wound healing. These data suggest that there is a susceptible population of patients with impaired bone health due to pharmacological intervention for depression once thought to only include patients with pre-existing compromised bone (i.e., osteoporosis).

 </sup> is revealing a potentially larger problem not limited to osteoporosis. Further study is needed to determine if long-term SSRI treatment alters bone remodelling through other pathways such as TNF-α signalling linked to inflammation and early healing. Such alteration may require modification of treatment following bone injury or in anticipation of surgical bone defect repair.
