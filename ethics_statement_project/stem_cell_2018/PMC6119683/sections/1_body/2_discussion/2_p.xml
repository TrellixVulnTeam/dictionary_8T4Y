<p id="Par13">Due to this disruption of normal bone healing, we hypothesized that sertraline drives scar formation (repair rather than regeneration) within the defect site. Decreased cartilage formation coupled with increased mature collagen fibre formation in the sertraline-exposed animals would alter the secondary fracture healing process, resulting in decreased bone formation. The significant presence of medium and thick collagen fibres within the defect show a mature collagen structure in the exposed animals, indicating that the innate healing response was sufficient to form repair tissue (scar) but was not sufficient to produce mature bone. This result is not indicative of delayed healing due to a lack of difference in the amount of thin, immature collagen fibre formation between the control and sertraline-exposed animals. Interestingly, the delivery of the osteoinductive morphogen, BMP2, previously shown to accelerate healing through endochondral ossification (cartilage formation) in this model,

 </sup> was insufficient to overcome the effects of sertraline for either cartilage or subsequent bone formation. The decreases in bone formation in addition to the significant increase in mature collagen fibres found within the defect site indicate disruption of bone regeneration leading to scar formation as a repair mechanism.
