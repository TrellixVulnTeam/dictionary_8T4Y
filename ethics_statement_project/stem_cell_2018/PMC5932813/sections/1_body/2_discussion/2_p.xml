<p id="Par79">Various strategies to reduce the incidence of CRBSI have been evaluated, including the use of antibiotic-impregnated catheters, strict hygienic measures, eradication of

Given the integral role of long-term CVC use in the health care system, administering lock solutions to patients with these types of catheters remains an important option for the prevention and adjunctive treatment of CRBSI. The lock technique is a preventive strategy that inhibits bacterial colonisation in the catheter hubs, which is the initial step of endoluminal catheter colonisation and the development of infection [
