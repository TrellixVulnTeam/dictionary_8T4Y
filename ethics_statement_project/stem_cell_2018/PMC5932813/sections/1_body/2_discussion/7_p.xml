<p id="Par84">In this study, we aim to assess the efficacy of taurolidine-citrate as a catheter lock solution in preventing CVC bacterial colonisation and, consequently, CRBSI in neutropenic haematological patients. If our hypothesis is proven, the study could provide important solid evidence on the potential usefulness of this preventive procedure in a population at high risk of CRBSI, in whom this complication may significantly impair patient outcome.</p>
