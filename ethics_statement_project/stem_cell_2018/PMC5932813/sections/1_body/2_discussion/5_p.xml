<p id="Par82">Taurolidine is a non-toxic agent with antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. It reduces biofilm formation and does not develop antibiotic resistance because it acts as an antiseptic rather than an antibiotic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Interestingly, due to its broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, taurolidine-citrate used as a lock solution not only reduced the risk of CRBSI but also the risk of Gram-negative infections according to the results of a recent meta-analysis conducted in the general population without cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In the aforementioned systematic review in patients with cancer by Norris et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], taurolidine showed beneficial results compared with placebo in two of the three studies involving paediatric patients with cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. On the contrary, a third study of paediatric patients with totally implantable venous access ports showed no beneficial effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Likewise, in a recent prospective, randomised, phase IV trial, taurolidine-citrate did not show a significant reduction in the risk of infection when used in adult patients with non-haematological cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These studies have important limitations due to the lack of data on adult and/or high-risk neutropenic patients, the type of catheters studied (tunnelled or ports), and the lack of information regarding the intervention (e.g. dwelling of the solution, time, and periodicity of the lock technique).
