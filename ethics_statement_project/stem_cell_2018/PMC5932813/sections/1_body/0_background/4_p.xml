<p id="Par19">The use of lock therapy with different solutions as a method of preventing luminal catheter colonisation is an effective strategy in reducing CRBSI [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Lock therapy involves instillation of a solution into the catheter lumen for a variable period of time, depending on the solution at hand [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Moreover, the use of lock therapy decreases the incidence of CRBIS in some studies involving patients with cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, significant differences in the definitions of CRBSI exist in the studies performed, as well as in the type of catheters, the solutions used, and the dwelling times. Additionally, almost all studies have been performed in paediatric populations, and the number of high-risk neutropenic patients included in the studies is very small. In fact, national guidelines do not currently support the prophylactic use of lock therapy in patients with cancer, while waiting for higher-quality scientific evidence.
