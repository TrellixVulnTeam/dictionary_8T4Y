<p id="Par20">Vancomycin, ethanol, and taurolidine have been the most frequently studied lock solutions in patients with cancer, with very variable results, according to the significant aforementioned differences in the methodology of the studies and the population involved [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Of note, there is great concern regarding the use of vancomycin as a lock solution, since there is a risk of developing antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, the adverse events observed with the use of ethanol discourage its use as a lock solution. Taurolidine is a non-toxic substance derived from the amino acid taurine, which has anti-adherent, immunomodulatory, antithrombotic, and antitumour properties [
