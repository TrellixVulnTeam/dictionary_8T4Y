<p id="Par16">Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) is one of the most frequent complications associated with the long-term use of catheters. Patients with cancer usually have central venous catheters (CVC) implanted for an indefinite period for the administration of chemotherapy and other products and medications and are at increased risk of presenting with this complication, especially during the neutropenic phase. CRBSI in patients with cancer is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, with excess costs and prolonged length of hospital stay [
