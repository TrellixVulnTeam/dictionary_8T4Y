<p id="Par76">In compliance with the standards of Good Clinical Practice, the promoter will carry out the monitoring tasks of the study following the approved monitoring plan. Among others, the tasks of monitoring will include the assessment of the correct application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the assessment of the quality of the data collected, the maintenance of the blind, the development and reporting of any adverse events, and the maintenance of the confidentiality of the patients.
