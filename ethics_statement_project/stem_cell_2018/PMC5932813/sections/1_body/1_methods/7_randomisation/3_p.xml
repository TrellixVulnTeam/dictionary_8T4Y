<p id="Par42">The taurolidine-citrate-heparin and the heparin-placebo solutions will be prepared in each pharmacy department, and they will be dispensed in 2.5-mL syringes identified with the name of the drug, defined as heparin/taurolidine-citrate, to maintain the blinding. Citrate is an anticoagulant substance without antimicrobial activity, which accompanies taurolidine as an antiaggregant agent. Both lock solutions are colourless and odourless, which makes further masking unnecessary. The blind will be open before the statistical analysis, but only when the trial has concluded and the definitive data will be registered in the database. Only in cases with suspected serious adverse events will the blinding be open.</p>
