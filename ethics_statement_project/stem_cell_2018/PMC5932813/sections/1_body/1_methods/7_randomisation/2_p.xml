<p id="Par41">A unique list of coded numbers containing the randomised solutions will be generated in the Clinical Research Unit. The randomisation will be performed in each block and stratified. The stratum will contain three groups: patients with leukaemia, patients undergoing an autologous transplantation, and patients undergoing an allogeneic transplantation. The random number generator of SAS version 9.2 will generate the three lists. Once generated, the list will be kept in the pharmacy file, in the pharmacy department of ICO Hospitalet with restricted access to the blinded personnel involved in the trial. When a patient from any of the two participating centres meets the inclusion criteria and signs the informed consent, an email with the recruitment sheet of the patient will be sent to the pharmacy department of ICO Hospitalet, where the randomisation will take place, by the investigator from the pharmacy department in charge of the study. The assignment will be made sequentially, and each patient will be assigned a randomisation number.</p>
