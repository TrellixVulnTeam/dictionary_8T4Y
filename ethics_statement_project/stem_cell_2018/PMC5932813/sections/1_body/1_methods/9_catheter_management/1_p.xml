<p id="Par44">Multilumen, non-tunnelled CVCs will be inserted into the vein by a specifically trained staff, under the standard precautions. At the time of the catheter placement, the insertion site will be disinfected with 2% chlorhexidine in an alcohol base and then covered with a transparent dressing, except in patients with allergy to this type of dressing, in whom sterile gauze will be used. Also, when there is any sign of inflammation at the insertion site, the dressing will be replaced by a chlorhexidine-impregnated dressing. The care of the CVCs will include the replacement of the dressings every 6–10 days, or before if necessary. Before any manipulation, the catheter hubs will be disinfected using an external clean with 70° alcohol. If the catheter is sealed, the hubs will be disinfected every 6–10 days. If any of the catheters lumens become sluggish or occluded, flushing with urokinase will be performed. Any change of these procedures will be recorded in the database. The manipulations of the CVCs will be carried out under maximum barrier measures.</p>
