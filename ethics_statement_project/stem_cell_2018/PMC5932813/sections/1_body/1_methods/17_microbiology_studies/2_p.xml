<p id="Par75">In the case of CRBSI due to coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), if the same species are isolated in any of the catheter hubs or tip and in the blood cultures, the strains will be preserved frozen for further analysis. CNS isolates from blood and catheter samples will be sent to the microbiology laboratory of HUB. Species identification will be confirmed using MALDI-TOF (MALDI Biotyper, Bruker Daltonics, Germany). Finally, isolates will be studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis after restriction with SmaI in order to determine the intrapatient genetic relationship following the criteria described by Tenover [
