<p id="Par63">For the assessment of the primary endpoint (bacterial colonisation rate of the CVC hubs), swabs of the inner surfaces of the catheter hubs will be obtained by the nursing personnel before randomisation and three times weekly (approximately every 48-72Â h) thereafter for culture, until the end of the intervention. All swabs are made of viscose, and only the swab of the catheter insertion site has a transport media (Stuart media). One swab is used for each lumen The cultures of the collected swabs will be processed in the microbiology department. The results of the cultures will be reviewed by the participating investigators and will be written down in the data collection form and in the specific database.</p>
