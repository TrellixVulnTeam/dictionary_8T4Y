<p id="Par43">Once the randomisation has been performed, a syringe containing 2.5 mL of the assigned lock solution (taurolidine 2%-citrate 4%-heparin 500 UI/mL, or heparin 1% alone at a dose of 1000 UI/mL) will be injected, by usual haematology ward nurses, through each catheter lumen three times a week, approximately every 48-72 h. The solution will be allowed to dwell for approximately 2 h. In all cases, the solution will be aspirated with a syringe and discarded. Before the lock technique, cultures of the hubs and the CVC insertion site will be taken in order to assess the bacterial colonisation of these sites. The research nurse in charge of the study will supervise all the proceedings related with the intervention. Also, the nurse in charge will periodically provide a report to the principal investigator of the study, informing whether the interventions have been performed properly.</p>
