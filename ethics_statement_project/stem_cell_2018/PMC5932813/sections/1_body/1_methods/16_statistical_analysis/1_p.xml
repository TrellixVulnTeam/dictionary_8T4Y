<p id="Par71">The analysis of the data will be carried out during the last 6Â months of the project when all fieldwork has been completed. The database will then be analysed using the stepwise logistic regression model of the R software (R v. 3.2.5). The analyses will be made by intention-to-treat (all patients randomised who have a primary endpoint available). To handle missing data multiple imputation will be done under the missing at random assumption.</p>
