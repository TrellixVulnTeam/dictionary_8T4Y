<p id="Par72">For the analysis of the primary endpoint, the frequency of colonisation of the CVC hubs in both treatment groups will be compared. For the analysis of the secondary endpoints, the frequency of CRBSI will be compared between the two groups, as well as the need for CVC removal for any cause and overall case-fatality rate (30Â days). Exploratory subgroup analyses will be conducted by underlying haematological condition (leukaemia, autologous HSCT, and allogeneic HSCT) and by centre. Due to the fact that a patient could have been included twice, the potential impact of independence violation will be assessed repeating the main analysis using patient as a cluster.</p>
