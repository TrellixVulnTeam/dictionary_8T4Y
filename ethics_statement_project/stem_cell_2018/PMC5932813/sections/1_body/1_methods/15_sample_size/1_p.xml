<p id="Par70">According to our previous experience [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], we estimated that around 20% of patients in the control group will present positive cultures of the catheter hubs. A reduction of this figure to 5% in the taurolidine-citrate-heparin group would be clinically relevant. To detect a 15% difference between groups with a power of 80%, it would be necessary to include 135 patients in the study. Considering the possibility of a loss of 10% of cases, the final sample should be 150 patients.
