<p id="Par55">This is the first randomised trial that investigates the safety of a lower platelet concentrate transfusion threshold prior to CVC placement, in a non-inferiority design. If this trial concludes that omission of prophylactic platelets in patients with a platelet count of 10 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L and higher is safe, guidelines that advise routine administration of platelet concentrate might be adjusted. For the Netherlands alone, we calculated that a transfusion threshold of 10 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L for prophylactic platelet transfusion prior CVC placement instead of 50 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L could lead to a cost reduction of 9.2 million euros per year [
