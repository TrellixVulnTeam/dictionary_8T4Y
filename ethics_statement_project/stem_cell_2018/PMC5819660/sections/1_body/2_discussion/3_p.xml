<p id="Par57">Various factors associated with bleeding complications after CVC placement have been identified [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The risk of bleeding after central venous catheterisation is multifactorial and is composed of procedural, patient and physician characteristics. Number of attempts, inadvertent arterial puncture, vein size, vein lesion, patient compliance, obesity and pulmonary hyperinflation have also been associated with bleeding risk [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the isolated effect of thrombocytopenia. Randomisation will divide patient-related factors evenly over both treatment arms. All lines are placed by experienced proceduralists, under real-time US guidance.
