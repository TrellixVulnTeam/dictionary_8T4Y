<p id="Par58">A concern regarding safety could be the occurrence of major bleeding in the no-platelet-concentrate-transfusion arm of the study. Based on previous observational studies we believe that the risk for serious complications is limited. We monitor the patients intensively and rescue platelet concentrate is available. Prolonged manual compression, or a suture at the insertion site are suggested as safe and minimally invasive interventions to stop prolonged bleeding [
