 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. One meta-analysis showed a lower incidence of arterial puncture with the use of US, namely 37/2009 (1.8%), compared to 196/2018 (9.7%) with anatomical landmarks (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.42). Also, the occurrence of haematoma was reduced from 113/1512 (7.5%) to 24/1500 (1.6%), with a RR 0.30 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.46) [
