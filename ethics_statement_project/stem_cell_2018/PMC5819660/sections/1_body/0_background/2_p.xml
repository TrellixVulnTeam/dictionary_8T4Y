<p id="Par6">In the last decades, more has become known about transfusion-related morbidity and mortality; platelet transfusion bears a substantial risk for morbidity and mortality, including transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion-associated cardiac overload (TACO), allergic reactions, allo-immunisation and transfusion-related infections [
