<p id="Par5">Central venous catheter (CVC) placement is a frequently applied medical intervention that enables both monitoring and treatment of patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The inserted cannula provides central venous access either in the neck region (subclavian vein or jugular vein) or groin region (femoral vein). CVCs form an essential element of treatment in various patient categories, mainly haematologic and intensive care patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The latter patient categories have an elevated risk for a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), due to their treatment and the physiopathology of their illnesses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Thrombocytopenia is associated with an increased bleeding risk for many invasive procedures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, abnormal traditional coagulation tests are known to be a poor predictor of peri-procedural bleeding [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Current national and international guidelines are conflicting, most recent Dutch and UK guidelines support prophylactic platelet transfusion below a platelet count of 50 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L, prior to CVC placement [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Others support the administration of prophylactic platelet transfusion below a platelet count of 20 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L; however, the evidence supporting these recommendations is of low quality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Current prophylactic platelet transfusion practice prior to CVC placement varies widely [
