<p id="Par33">Bleeding complications will be scored using WHO grades of bleeding specified for CVC placement, which are defined in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. The WHO bleeding score is adapted according to Zeidler [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Grade 1 consists of mild symptoms not requiring any intervention; for example, local haematoma formation or wound oozing. Grade 2 bleeding is defined as mild symptoms requiring interventions, without haemodynamic instability or red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. For the current study, this includes procedure-related bleeding that requires more than 20 min of manual compression to stop. Grade 3 bleeding is defined as procedure-related bleeding requiring red cell transfusion. Grade 4 bleeding is defined as bleeding associated with hemodynamic instability or death, defined as CVC-related bleeding associated with severe hemodynamic instability (hypotension; &gt; 50 mmHg fall or &gt; 50% decrease in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure, with associated tachycardia (heart rate increase of &gt; 20% for 20 min) and requiring RBC transfusion over routine transfusion needs or fatal bleeding [
