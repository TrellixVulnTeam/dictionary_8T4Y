<p id="Par30">The proceduralist, the physician who inserts the catheter, is blinded for treatment allocation. This blinding takes place to prevent bias in ordering platelet transfusion in case of a peri-procedural bleeding complication. The proceduralist is not directly involved in patient care of the included patient. Blinding is not feasible for the patient and the treating medical staff. Obtained photographs of the insertion site will be analysed for haematoma size and bleeding post hoc. This provides an additional blinded bleeding outcome.</p>
