<p id="Par43">Secondary endpoints are subdivided into clinical outcome variables and health-economic-outcome variables. WHO grade-1 bleedings and subdivision on minor and major bleeding are scored as secondary outcome. Another clinical outcome variable is the validated HEME bleeding score [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Also, photographs of the insertion site at different time points are blindly scored. Other clinical variables include ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU and hospital mortality, transfusion requirements and occurrence of transfusion reactions such as TRALI and allergic reactions. Next to descriptive statistics, the effect of prophylactic platelet transfusion on the primary and secondary outcomes will be analysed using multiple logistic regression for patient-, procedural-, catheter- and transfusion-related characteristics. In patients receiving platelet transfusion, patient- and transfusion-related factors will be analysed to assess the relation to post-transfusion platelet increment. To investigate the relationship between bleeding events and platelet count (post-transfusion platelet count if applicable) we divide platelet count into five groups: 10–20, 20–30, 30–40, 40–50 and above 50.
