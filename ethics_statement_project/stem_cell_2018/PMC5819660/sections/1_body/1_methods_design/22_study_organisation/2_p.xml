<p id="Par52">An independent monitor is installed to perform study monitoring. Remote monitoring by means of queries on the database will be done by a statistician and analysed by the monitor to signalise early aberrant patterns, trends, issues with consistency or credibility and other anomalies. On-site monitoring will comprise controlling presence and completeness of the research dossier and the informed consent forms, source data checks will be performed in the files of the first three patients of each participating centre, followed by at least 10% of files. Each centre will be visited at least once every year.</p>
