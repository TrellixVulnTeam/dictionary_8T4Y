 <sup>9</sup> are eligible for participation if a central line is indicated. Both patients who need elective and emergency line insertions are appropriate for randomisation. Both tunnelled and non-tunnelled CVCs are suitable for inclusion, as well as lines inserted for continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration. Notably, patients requiring replacement of central catheters are also eligible. Patients can participate in the study multiple times; however, a patient can be randomised once per 24 h. The CVC should be expected to be in situ for at least 24 h to monitor 24-h bleeding complications. Therefore, central lines for single plasmapheresis or the harvesting of stem cells will not be included. All other indications can be included, e.g. inotrope medication, lack of peripheral venous access, haemodialysis, haemodynamic monitoring, administration of irritating medication such as chemotherapy. According to guidelines, patients with an International Normalised Ratio (INR) of &gt; 1.5 before line placement are excluded [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, patients are eligible after correction of an elevated INR with fresh frozen plasma or prothrombin concentrate. Non-adult patients (age below 18 years) are excluded, as are patients with a history of congenital or acquired coagulation factor deficiency or bleeding diathesis. Also patients on therapeutic anticoagulant therapy are excluded. Of note, patients with a single platelet aggregation inhibitor and/or therapeutic unfractionated heparin that is discontinued at least 1 h prior to insertion are considered to be eligible.
