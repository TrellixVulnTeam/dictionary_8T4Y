  <p>Informed consent will be obtained from all participants or a legal representative in case the former is impossible. Intensive Care patients may be included using the deferred consent procedure. We will randomise each patient at the intensive care unit (ICU) who meets the inclusion criteria directly before CVC placement. Informed consent from the legal representative will be requested as soon as possible. If a patient deceases before informed consent can be obtained, data is used</p>
