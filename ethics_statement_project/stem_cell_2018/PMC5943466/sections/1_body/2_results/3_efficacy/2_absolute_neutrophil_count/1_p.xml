<p>The changes in median ANC over time were biphasic and were similar in all four treatment groups during all four cycles. In Cycle 1, the ANC nadir occurred at approximately Day 6 to Day 9, with two separate peaks with the first peak observed on Day 3 and the second peak observed between Days 10 and 13 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="cam41388-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). In all treatment groups, the ANC peak on Day 3 increased in each cycle and reached a maximum by Cycle 3. The postnadir ANC recovery peak was approximately the same level in each cycle. The ANC values in patients receiving the two higher doses of Rolontis, 135 and 270 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/kg, were higher than the values in patients receiving pegfilgrastim on most days during each cycle. Patients receiving 45 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/kg of Rolontis showed slightly lower ANC values than patients on pegfilgrastim during the first half of each cycle but the values were similar in the second half of each cycle.
