<p>The incidence of febrile neutropenia was low in all treatment groups across all cycles and was reported in two patients (6%) in the pegfilgrastim group compared with one patient (3%) each in the Rolontis 135 and 270 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/kg groups and three patients (8%) in the 45 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/kg group. The incidents of FN in the 135 and 270 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/kg Rolontis groups and in two of the patients in the 45 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/kg Rolontis group occurred in Cycle 1. One patient in the 45 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/kg Rolontis group experienced FN in both Cycle 2 and Cycle 3, and one of the patients in the pegfilgrastim group experienced FN in Cycle 3 and the other in Cycle 4. The overall rate of hospitalizations across all cycles (8%) was also similar across treatment groups, with the highest incidence observed in the pegfilgrastim group (five patients, 14%) and the lowest incidence observed in the Rolontis 270 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/kg group (one patient, 3%). Three patients in the 45 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/kg Rolontis group were hospitalized, but only one patient was hospitalized due to febrile neutropenia. No statistically significant differences in either febrile neutropenia incidence or hospitalizations were observed between any Rolontis dose level and pegfilgrastim.
