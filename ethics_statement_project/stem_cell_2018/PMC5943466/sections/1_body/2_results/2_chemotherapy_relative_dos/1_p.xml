 <italic>μ</italic>g/kg Rolontis group, discontinued from the study after receiving TC therapy but before receiving Rolontis treatment. Overall, 138 patients (93%) completed all four cycles of TC chemotherapy, with 10 patients (7%) discontinuing treatment prematurely. Treatment delivery of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide was &gt;97% over all four cycles, with nine patients (6%) experiencing TC dose interruptions and five patients (3%) requiring TC dose delays. The median dosing compliance with Rolontis and pegfilgrastim was 100% across all four cycles, with dose delays due to nontreatment‐related AEs required for one patient in the 45
