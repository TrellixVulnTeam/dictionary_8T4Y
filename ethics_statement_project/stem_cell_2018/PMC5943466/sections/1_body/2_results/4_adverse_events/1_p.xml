<p>Most patients experienced treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and the incidence of TEAEs was similar between treatment groups (Table 
 <xref rid="cam41388-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap">4</xref>). More Grade 3–4 TEAEs were reported in the 45 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/kg Rolontis group than in the other treatment groups. The most commonly reported TEAEs were fatigue, alopecia, nausea, diarrhea, and bone pain. Treatment‐related TEAEs were reported in &gt;50% of patients in all treatment groups. The most frequently reported treatment‐related TEAE in all four treatment groups was bone pain, which was reported in more than 20% of patients in all four treatment groups (Table 
 <xref rid="cam41388-tbl-0005" ref-type="table-wrap">5</xref>). No patients discontinued from the study due to treatment‐related AEs. No clinically meaningful differences in TEAEs (incidence or type) were observed overall or for individual events across Rolontis dose levels or between treatment types. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported for 13% of patients across cohorts, with treatment‐related SAEs observed only in the pegfilgrastim group (Table 
 <xref rid="cam41388-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap">4</xref>). Few patients required treatment discontinuation for AEs, none of which were considered treatment‐related, and no disease progression patient deaths or events were reported.
