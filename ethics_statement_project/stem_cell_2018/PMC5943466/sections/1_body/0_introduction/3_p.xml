<p>Rolontis™ (Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Henderson, NV) (eflapegrastim, SPI‐2012, HM10460A) was developed by conjugating the recombinant human G‐CSF analog (17th
 <sub>,</sub> 65th Ser‐G‐CSF, no additional N‐terminal Met) and the human immunoglobulin G4 Fc fragment via a 3.4 kDa Peg linker to produce a longer‐acting G‐CSF. In preclinical studies, Rolontis has demonstrated similar in vitro activity and a similar pharmacokinetic (PK) profile compared with pegfilgrastim

Pharmacokinetic analysis of Rolontis in vivo revealed a twofold to threefold increase in area under the time‐concentration curve (AUC) for ANC compared to pegfilgrastim when administered at similar doses (when comparing the concentration of the G‐CSF molecule) in neutropenic mice and rats, normal rats, and monkeys. Furthermore, the duration of severe neutropenia in neutropenic mice and rats was significantly reduced compared to either pegfilgrastim or filgrastim
