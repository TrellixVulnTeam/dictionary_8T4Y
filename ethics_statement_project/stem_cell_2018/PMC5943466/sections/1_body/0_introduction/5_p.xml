<p>The current Phase 2 study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Rolontis at three dose levels, as compared with pegfilgrastim, in patients with breast cancer receiving myelosuppressive docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC) chemotherapy. The clinical development of Rolontis is based upon the potential viability of Rolontis as a more potent, long‐acting alternative to pegfilgrastim that provides clinical benefits at a lower G‐CSF dose.</p>
