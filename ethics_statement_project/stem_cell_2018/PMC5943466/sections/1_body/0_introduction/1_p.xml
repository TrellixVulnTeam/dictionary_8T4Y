<p>Many effective chemotherapy regimens induce myelosuppressive side effects that can result in treatment delays, dose reductions, and an overall inability to complete treatment, which may compromise clinical outcomes. Myeloid growth factors, a class of biologic agents that regulate the proliferation, differentiation, survival, and activation of cells in the myeloid lineage, are often administered prophylactically to reduce the incidence of severe neutropenia, one of the most common and dose‐limiting myelosuppressive side effects of anticancer chemotherapy

As patients who develop febrile neutropenia are at risk for hospitalization, additional morbidities and even mortality, mitigation of the severity, and duration of this condition have been shown to improve chemotherapy treatment compliance and, ultimately, patient survival
