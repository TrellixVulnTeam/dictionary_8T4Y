<p>Sample size estimates were based on a noninferiority design. It was assumed that the pooled standard deviation of DSN for Cycle 1 would be 2.1 days, estimated from previous pegfilgrastim studies 
 <xref rid="cam41388-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>. The total planned sample size of 144 patients provided an 80% power to establish noninferiority, based on the one‐sided 95% upper confidence limit of the difference in the mean DSN of pooled experimental arms and mean DSN of the control arm being &lt;1 day.
