<p>Treatment differences in DSN in Cycle 1 were analyzed using confidence intervals (CIs) calculated based upon 10,000 bootstrap samples stratified by baseline weight (&lt;65 kg, ≥65 kg and ≤75 kg, or &gt;75 kg). Two‐sided 95% CIs for the difference in mean DSN between each Rolontis group and the pegfilgrastim group were calculated. Noninferiority was demonstrated if the upper limit of the two‐sided 95% CI was &lt;1 day. Two types of 
 <italic>P</italic>‐values were reported: The noninferiority 
 <italic>P</italic>‐value was calculated as two times the proportion of treatment difference &gt;1 in the resampling, and the superiority 
 <italic>P</italic>‐value was calculated as two times the proportion of treatment difference &gt;0 in the resampling.
