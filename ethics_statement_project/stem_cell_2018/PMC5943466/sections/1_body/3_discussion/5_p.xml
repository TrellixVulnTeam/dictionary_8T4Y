<p>All doses of Rolontis and pegfilgrastim were well tolerated. While most of the patients in all four groups (≥89%) experienced TEAEs, approximately one‐half of patients (51% to 64%) experienced AEs that were considered to be treatment‐related. The most frequently observed TEAEs (in ≥20% of patients) in all four treatment groups included fatigue, alopecia, nausea, diarrhea, and bone pain. Most of these events (fatigue, alopecia, nausea, and diarrhea) are typically associated with TC treatment. Bone pain is an expected event associated with myeloid growth factors due to the mechanism of action of this class of agents
