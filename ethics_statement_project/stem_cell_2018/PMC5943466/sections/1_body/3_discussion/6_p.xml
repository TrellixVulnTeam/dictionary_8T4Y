<p>Adverse events were primarily mild to moderate in severity, with few patients experiencing SAEs or TEAEs leading to drug modification or discontinuation across all treatment groups. No trends in TEAE incidences were observed overall or for most individual events, although insomnia and pyrexia were reported more frequently in the pegfilgrastim (31% and 22%, respectively) than Rolontis groups (pooled 12% and 9%, respectively). Neutropenia and decreased neutrophil count were more frequently reported in the 45 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/kg Rolontis group (28% and 33%, respectively) than any other group, likely due to suboptimal dose level, which is consistent with the longer DSN, lower ANC levels, and deeper ANC nadir observed in this low Rolontis dose group. No neutralizing antibodies against Rolontis or G‐CSF were detected in patients administered Rolontis in this study.
