<p>The mean Cycle 1 DSNs observed with Rolontis in the current study were comparable or lower than what was demonstrated for pegfilgrastim. At the two higher doses of Rolontis studied, the mean Cycle 1 DSNs were statistically noninferior to pegfilgrastim, and the Cycle 1 DSN with the 270 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/kg Rolontis dose was statistically superior to pegfilgrastim (
 <italic>P = </italic>0.023). In Cycles 2, 3, and 4, the DSN with 135 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/kg Rolontis and 270 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/kg Rolontis were noninferior to pegfilgrastim and the DSN with 45 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/kg Rolontis was noninferior to pegfilgrastim in Cycles 2 and 3.
