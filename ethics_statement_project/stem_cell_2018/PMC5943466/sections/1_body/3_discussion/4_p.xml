<p>In Cycle 1, the majority of the evaluable population, both overall and in each group, did not experience any severe neutropenia, with the highest proportion of patients experiencing severe neutropenia in the Rolontis 45 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/kg group (36%) along with the 135 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/kg (19%) and 270 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/kg (3%). Rolontis groups and 14% of the pegfilgrastim group indicate a dose proportional reduction of severe neutropenia by Rolontis. This was due in part to the study design which did not mandate daily CBC collections until the ANC &lt;1.5 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L. In subsequent cycles, the DSN was generally shorter across all arms, consistent with other studies using the same myelosuppressive chemotherapy
