<p>The primary objective of the current open‐label, multicenter, dose‐ranging, active‐controlled study was to evaluate three different dose levels of Rolontis on the DSN (time from ANC &lt;0.5 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L to ANC ≥2.0 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L) during Cycle 1 of treatment in patients with breast cancer who were receiving adjuvant or neoadjuvant TC chemotherapy. Several Phase 3 randomized, blinded studies conducted with other novel long‐acting myeloid growth factors or a pegfilgrastim biosimilar investigated the same endpoint in patients with breast cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. These studies suggested other long‐acting growth factors could have similar effects on the duration of DSN in Cycle 1 of TC therapy
