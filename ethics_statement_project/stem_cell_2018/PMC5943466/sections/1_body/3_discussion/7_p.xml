<p>Rolontis is being further investigated in two currently ongoing randomized, Phase 3 trials. The results from this study show that the dose range of 135–270 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/kg was both efficacious and safe. Based on these results, a dose of 13.2 mg/0.6 mL/dose, equivalent to 3.6 mg G‐CSF, was selected for the Phase 3 development program. This dose is equivalent to approximately 176 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/kg for a 75 kg patient and is being administered in two ongoing Phase 3 studies with Rolontis.
