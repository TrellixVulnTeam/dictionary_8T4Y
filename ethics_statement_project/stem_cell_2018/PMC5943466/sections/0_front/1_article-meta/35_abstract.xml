 <title>Abstract</title>
 <p>This randomized, open‐label, active‐controlled study investigated the safety and efficacy of three doses of Rolontis (eflapegrastim), a novel, long‐acting myeloid growth factor, versus pegfilgrastim in breast cancer patients being treated with docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">TC</styled-content>). The primary efficacy endpoint was duration of severe neutropenia (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">DSN</styled-content>) during the first cycle of treatment. Patients who were candidates for adjuvant/neoadjuvant 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">TC</styled-content> chemotherapy were eligible for participation. 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">TC</styled-content> was administered on Day 1, followed by 45, 135, or 270 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/kg Rolontis or 6 mg pegfilgrastim on Day 2. Complete blood counts were monitored daily when the absolute neutrophil count (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">ANC</styled-content>) fell to &lt;1.5 × 10
  <sup>9</sup>/L. Up to four cycles of 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">TC</styled-content> were investigated. The difference in 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">DSN</styled-content> (time from 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">ANC</styled-content> &lt;0.5 × 10
  <sup>9</sup>/L to 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">ANC</styled-content> recovery ≥2.0 × 10
  <sup>9</sup>/L) between the Rolontis and pegfilgrastim groups was −0.28 days (confidence interval [
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">CI</styled-content>]: −0.56, −0.06) at 270 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/kg, 0.14 days (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">CI</styled-content>: −0.28, 0.64) at 135 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/kg, and 0.72 days (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">CI</styled-content>: 0.19, 1.27) at 45 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/kg. Noninferiority to pegfilgrastim was demonstrated at 135 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/kg (
  <italic>P = </italic>0.002) and 270 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/kg (
  <italic>P </italic>&lt;
  <italic> </italic>.001), with superiority demonstrated at 270 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/kg (0.03 days; 
  <italic>P = </italic>0.023). The most common treatment‐related adverse events (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">AE</styled-content>s) were bone pain, myalgia, arthralgia, back pain, and elevated white blood cell counts, with similar incidences across groups. All doses of Rolontis were well tolerated, and no new or significant treatment‐related toxicities were observed. In Cycle 1, Rolontis demonstrated noninferiority at the 135 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/kg dose and statistical superiority in 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">DSN</styled-content> at the 270 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/kg dose when compared to pegfilgrastim.
