<p>For the primary endpoint, non-inferiority of NEPA and APR/GRAN was demonstrated if the lower limit of the confidence interval (CI; two-sided 95% CI significance level) for the difference between NEPA and APR/GRAN in proportion of patients with overall CR was greater than −10%. The risk difference and associated 95% CI were analyzed using the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by gender. For secondary endpoints of acute/delayed and daily CR as well as no emesis, NSN, no nausea, no rescue use, and NIDL as assessed by the FLIE, statistical analyses utilized the same methods as the primary endpoint, without testing for non-inferiority.</p>
