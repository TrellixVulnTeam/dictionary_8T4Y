<p>The sample size was based on the assumption of an overall CR rate of 75% in both treatment groups. For a two-sided test of difference using a Type I error of 0.05, a sample size of 395 assessable patients/group was needed to ensure 90% power. Assuming a drop-out rate of 5%, this was increased to 416 patients/group for a total of 832 patients.</p>
