<p>Herein we report the results of a Phase III study of a single dose of NEPA plus DEX compared with a standard 3-day regimen of aprepitant plus granisetron (APR/GRAN) plus DEX, in patients receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The objective was to demonstrate, in the first head-to head comparison study, non-inferiority of NEPA to APR/GRAN in preventing CINV associated with HEC. The study was designed in collaboration with the China FDA (CFDA) as a registration study for oral NEPA in China.</p>
