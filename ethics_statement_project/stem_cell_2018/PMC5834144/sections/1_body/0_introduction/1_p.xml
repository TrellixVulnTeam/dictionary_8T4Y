 <xref rid="mdx698-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and development of new antiemetics have led to dramatic improvements in prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) [

 <xref rid="mdx698-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. With utilization of guideline-recommended antiemetic prophylaxis, CINV can now be prevented in the majority of patients [
