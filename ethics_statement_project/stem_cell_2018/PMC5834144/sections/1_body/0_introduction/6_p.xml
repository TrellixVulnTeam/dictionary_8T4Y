<p>These studies supported the registration of oral NEPA in the United States (US) and Europe (EU) [
 <xref rid="mdx698-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="mdx698-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], with NEPA becoming the first alternative NK
 <sub>1</sub>RA (containing compound) and the first antiemetic fixed combination. Subsequently, the next NK
 <sub>1</sub>RA, oral rolapitant, was approved [
 <xref rid="mdx698-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. An intravenous fixed combination of NEPA (fosnetupitant 235 mg and palonosetron 0.25 mg) is currently under evaluation by the US Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA). Thus far, none of the NK
 <sub>1</sub>RAs have been compared in head-to-head trials, as all registration studies were conducted with a 5-HT
 <sub>3</sub>RA/DEX comparative control.
