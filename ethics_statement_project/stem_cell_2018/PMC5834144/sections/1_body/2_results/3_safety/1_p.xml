<p>The incidence of AEs was comparable between the two treatment groups (NEPA 58.1%, APR/GRAN 57.5%). The most common TRAEs were constipation (NEPA 8.0%, APR/GRAN 6.3%) and hiccups (NEPA 2.7%, APR/GRAN 1.4%). Among the patients reporting AEs, the majority (90%) reported events of mild/moderate intensity, with more severe AEs in the APR/GRAN group (10.8% versus NEPA 8.7%). There were two patients with serious TRAEs in each group (NEPA: i) atrial fibrillation and (ii) chest pain/hypotension/decreased heart rate/non-responsiveness (concomitant medication included amifostine); APR/GRAN: (i) increased alanine aminotransferase and (ii) pancreatitis. While the patient experiencing the chest pain/hypotension event recovered within an hour of NEPA treatment, this was the only AE leading to discontinuation from study. There were no deaths in the NEPA group, while four patients treated with APR/GRAN died due to unrelated AEs. Changes from baseline in 12-lead ECGs were rare and similar.</p>
