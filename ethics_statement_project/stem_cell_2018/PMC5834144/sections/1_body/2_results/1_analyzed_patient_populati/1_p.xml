<p>A total of 834 patients were randomized into the study (
 <italic>N</italic> = 417/group); 81% of patients were from China, and 12% from Thailand. Four patients randomized to NEPA and one patient to APR/GRAN did not receive study treatment and were therefore excluded from the safety/FAS populations. One additional NEPA-treated patient did not receive the protocol-required HEC and was also excluded from the FAS population. Consequently, 829 (413 NEPA/416 APR/GRAN) and 828 (412 NEPA/416 APR/GRAN) represented the safety and FAS efficacy populations, respectively (
