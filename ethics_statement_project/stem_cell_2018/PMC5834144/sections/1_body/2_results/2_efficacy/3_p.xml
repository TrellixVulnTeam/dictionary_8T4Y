<p>Response rates for the secondary efficacy endpoints during the acute phase slightly favored NEPA with the exception of no emesis, where slightly higher rates were seen for APR/GRAN (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="mdx698-T2">2</xref>). During the delayed and overall phases response rates favored NEPA for no emesis, NSN, and no rescue use, while no nausea rates were slightly higher for APR/GRAN. No rescue medication rates were significantly higher for NEPA during the delayed and overall phases (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="mdx698-T2">2</xref>). Metoclopramide was the most common rescue medication, used by 2.7% of NEPA patients and 5.0% of APR/GRAN patients, while all other rescue medications were used byâ€‰&lt;1% of patients.
