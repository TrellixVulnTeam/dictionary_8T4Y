<p>For NEPA registration in China, the CFDA requested that NEPA demonstrate comparable efficacy to a standard aprepitant and 5-HT
 <sub>3</sub>RA (granisetron) containing regimen. Thus, this phase III study in patients receiving cisplatin-based HEC was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of a single dose of NEPA to a standard 3-day aprepitant/granisetron regimen, both groups in combination with DEX as recommended by antiemetic guidelines. This study was also the first head-to-head comparison study of NK
 <sub>1</sub>-containing regimens. For the primary efficacy endpoint of overall CR, NEPA was non-inferior to APR/GRAN. For secondary efficacy endpoints of no emesis and NSN, delayed and overall rates were numerically but not significantly higher for NEPA. In addition, significantly more patients treated with NEPA did not need to use any rescue medication during the delayed and overall phases. Daily rates of CINV events (emesis/rescue use) did not change substantially throughout days 1â€“5 for APR/GRAN; however, rates for NEPA declined numerically over time and were significantly lower on day 5, again suggesting a benefit for delayed CINV.
