<p>Aprepitant, the first NK
 <sub>1</sub>RA in the class has been long available with well-established efficacy and safety in various HEC and MEC settings including cisplatin-, carboplatin-, and AC-based chemotherapies [
 <xref rid="mdx698-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Similarly, NEPA/DEX demonstrated unequivocal superiority over palonosetron/DEX in preventing CINV in pivotal trials in the HEC/AC settings, leading to its approval in the USA/Europe [

 <xref rid="mdx698-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="mdx698-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. With the most recent approval of rolapitant, the third-in-class NK
 <sub>1</sub>RA, clinicians have three NK
 <sub>1</sub>RA-containing options for patients at most risk for CINV. Recently, a network meta-analysis showed that all three NK
 <sub>1</sub>RAs have similar antiemetic effects [

 <sub>1</sub>-containing regimens have been directly compared with each other.
