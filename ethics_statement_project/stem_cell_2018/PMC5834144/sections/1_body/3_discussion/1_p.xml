<p>While the current antiemetic armamentarium offers the potential to prevent CINV in the majority of patients, events including hospitalization do occur. Simplifying the multi-drug regimens may be appealing to clinicians and patients and may enhance compliance with antiemetic guideline recommendations. The standard aprepitant regimen requires co-administration of a 5-HT
 <sub>3</sub> RA (in this study IV GRAN 30 min before chemotherapy) on day 1 and oral APR 60 min before chemotherapy on day 1 with subsequent oral doses 24 and 48 h later. As a combination of a highly selective NK
 <sub>1</sub>RA, netupitant, and the clinically superior 5-HT
 <sub>3</sub>RA, palonosetron, NEPA conveniently packages two classes of antiemetics recommended by guidelines in the HEC/high risk MEC settings in a single oral dose administered 60 min before chemotherapy. In clinical practice NEPA could either be taken at home or at the clinic/hospital before chemotherapy.
