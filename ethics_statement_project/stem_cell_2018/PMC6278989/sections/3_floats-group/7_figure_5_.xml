  <p>Multi-lineage engraftment levels of lineage-depleted cell products in NSG (NOD/SCID/IL2rg
   <sup>null</sup>) mice is comparable to CD34-enriched cell products from the same donor. (A) Graph depicts percent recovery of total nucleated cells (TNC) and CD34
   <sup>+</sup> cells from each arm following depletion or enrichment. (B) Numbers of total and transduced colony-forming cells (CFC) normalized to 1Ã—10
   <sup>8</sup> cells processed to each arm, and vector copy number (VCN) in the bulk transduced cells following ten days of culture. Data are representative of 2 healthy donor bone marrow products. Error bars represent the Standard Error of the Mean. (C) Engraftment of human CD45
   <sup>+</sup> cells and lineage development into T cells (CD3
   <sup>+</sup>), monocytes (CD14
   <sup>+</sup>) and B cells (CD20
   <sup>+</sup>) was determined by flow cytometry over 26 weeks following infusion. Data are representative of 9 mice for the lineage depleted (Lin-) arm and 6 mice for the CD34 enriched (CD34) arm, respectively.
