  <p>Multi-lineage engraftment of lineage depleted and transduced bone marrow (BM) and mobilized apheresis products (mAPH) in NSG mice. Recovery of total nucleated cells (TNC), CD34
   <sup>+</sup> cells and lineage positive (+) cells (A and B). (C-E) Gene transfer efficiency. The colony-forming potential of transduced cells in standard CFC assays is defined as the plating efficiency (TNC). The colony-forming potential normalized to the number of CD34
   <sup>+</sup> cells seeded is depicted as plating efficiency (CD34
   <sup>+</sup>). The percentage of colonies analyzed positive for the presence of lentivirus (LV) backbone by PCR analysis on DNA extracted from individual colonies is depicted as transduction efficiency. The vector copy number per cell in the bulk transduced population is depicted as VCN. The average VCN per cell in the individual CFC is depicted as single colony VCN. Data are representative of the average of 9 healthy BM products and 10 healthy mAPH products. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. (F) Engraftment of human CD45
   <sup>+</sup> cells and lineage development into T cells (CD3
   <sup>+</sup>), monocytes (CD14
   <sup>+</sup>) and B cells (CD20
   <sup>+</sup>) was determined by flow cytometry over 20 weeks following infusion of lineage-depleted cell products. Data are representative of 36 mice from 6 mAPH donors and 42 mice from 6 BM donors, respectively. Error bars represent the Standard Error of the Mean.
