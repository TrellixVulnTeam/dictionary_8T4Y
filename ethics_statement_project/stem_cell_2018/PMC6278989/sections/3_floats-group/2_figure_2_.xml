   <italic>In vitro</italic> repopulation potential restricted to CD34
   <sup>Hi</sup> hematopoietic cells. Mobilized leukapheresis from FA-A Patient 3 (Panel A) and a healthy donor (Panel B) were in parallel fluorescence stained with anti-CD34 antibody and sort-purified for CD34
   <sup>Hi</sup> and CD34
   <sup>Lo</sup> cells. Total nucleated cells (TNC) equivalent to 1500 CD34-expressing cells were seeded in CFC assays. Percentage of CD34
   <sup>+</sup> cells seeded in the assay that gave rise to colonies is represented as the % of colony-forming cells.
