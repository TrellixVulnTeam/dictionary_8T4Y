  <p>Diminished CD34
   <sup>Hi</sup> hematopoietic cells from Fanconi Anemia A genetic defect (FA-A) patients. CD34 expression in baseline bone marrow (BM) (Patients 1, 2, 3, and healthy donor 1) or mobilized leukapheresis (mAPH) (Patient 3 and healthy donor 2) products was determined by fluorescence staining and flow cytometry analysis. Positive cell fractions are gated based on unstained and isotype stained control samples into two levels of CD34 expression: low expression, CD34
   <sup>Lo</sup>, or high expression, CD34
   <sup>Hi</sup>. The average mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD34
   <sup>Lo</sup> population = 3453; standard error of the mean (SEM) = 516 and CD34
   <sup>Hi</sup> population = 19731; SEM = 4103.
