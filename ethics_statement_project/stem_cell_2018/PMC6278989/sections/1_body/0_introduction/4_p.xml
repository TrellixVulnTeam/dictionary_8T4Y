<p>Here we report HSPC collection results for the first 3 patients treated on our study. Initially, this protocol proposed direct isolation of CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells from BM without prior attempts at mobilization. The addition of a mobilization regimen with subsequent leukapheresis collections has permitted the evaluation of CD34 expression patterns in both product types and provided evidence for the need for alternative HSPC isolation strategies.
