<p>Importantly, the phenotype of limiting CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell numbers is not restricted to FA alone. Sickle cell disease (SCD) patients treated with hydroxyurea also display reduced CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell frequencies in BM, and there is a contraindication to mobilization of available CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells owing to an increased risk of vaso-occlusive crisis.

 </sup> Other inherited BM failure syndromes such as dyskeratosis congenita also are associated with abnormal CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell frequencies and behavior.

 </sup> As a larger number of disease targets become relevant for gene therapy, additional patient populations will likely display variable CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell frequency and antigen expression. These disease targets could also benefit from clinically viable alternative selection procedures such as we have developed here.
