<p>Here we confirm prior reports of inefficient CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell enrichment from FA patient blood products by direct, immunomagnetic bead-based separation, which is the current standard protocol for isolating HSPCs.

 </sup> We also demonstrate substantially reduced levels of CD34
 <sup>Hi</sup> cells in FA patients relative to healthy donors, which likely contributes to poor positive selection results in blood products from FA patients. Colony seeding assays demonstrate that only CD34
 <sup>Hi</sup> cells contribute to 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> colony-forming potential in both FA and healthy donor blood products, underscoring the need to preserve as many available CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells as possible during 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> manipulation for gene transfer. We demonstrate a clinically viable procedure for depleting lineage positive cells to indirectly enrich for CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells that preserves the limited numbers of these cells in FA-A patients without compromising viability, gene transfer, or engraftment potential.
