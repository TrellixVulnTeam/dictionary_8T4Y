<p>Our observation of CFC potential in only the CD34
 <sup>Hi</sup> fraction in both FA and healthy samples suggests that CD34
 <sup>Lo</sup> cells may not be contributing to hematopoietic reconstitution. Notably, our data are from mAPH samples not BM, and we will need more patients for confirmation. Additionally, the standard colony-forming assay best defines progenitor cells, more so than true long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells.

 </sup> Alternatively, xenotransplant of purified cells into immunodeficient mice could provide the most robust evidence for CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell function

 </sup> may provide additional insight into the desired target CD34
 <sup>+</sup> subpopulations for gene therapy if they are present in either the CD34
 <sup>Hi</sup> or CD34
 <sup>Lo</sup> populations in FA patients. In this regard, we recently demonstrated that the CD34
 <sup>Hi</sup>CD45RA
 <sup>âˆ’</sup>CD90
 <sup>+</sup> phenotype is responsible for hematopoietic repopulation in non-human primates in the autologous, myeloablative setting,

 </sup> and evaluation of this phenotype in the enrolled FA patients is ongoing. Critically, our strategy of depleting cells expressing mature blood cell lineage markers preserves all CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell phenotypes for gene transfer and infusion, as demonstrated by Patient 3, whose infused CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell dose was the largest received to date.
