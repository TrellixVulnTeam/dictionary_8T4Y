<p>In conclusion, we describe an alternative strategy to a direct, immunomagnetic bead-based selection of CD34-expressing cells that overcomes current barriers in isolation of blood stem and progenitor cells especially for diseases like FA. Our novel approach to preserve available CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells during initial blood product processing has the potential to improve gene therapy and gene editing in settings of limited CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell availability, including FA and other diseases in which direct CD34 enrichment has proven inefficient, such as SCD.
