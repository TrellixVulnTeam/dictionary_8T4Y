<p>A total of nine BM and ten mAPH products were processed to establish process validity. An average 60% of BM CD45
 <sup>+</sup> cells and 50% of mAPH CD45
 <sup>+</sup> cells expressed one of the four target markers (CD3, CD14, CD16, or CD19) (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S1A</italic> and 
 <italic>B</italic>, respectively). CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell content in these products ranged from 0.35-1.4% in BM and 0.06-0.9% in mAPH products. The average process run time for BM products was ten hours, whereas mAPH products were processed over 13 hours. Observed total nucleated cell (TNC) reduction was approximately 1 log for both BM and mAPH products following lineage depletion (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-1031806">Figure 4A</xref>). All target lineage
 <sup>+</sup> cells were depleted to less than 10% of initial numbers, and CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells were retained at 94.62±4.61% for BM products and 70.69±11.4% for mAPH products (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-1031806">Figure 4B</xref>). Retention of available CD34
 <sup>Hi</sup> and CD34
 <sup>Lo</sup> cells was observed and comparable or superior to that observed for the same products by direct CD34-enrichment (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S2</italic>). Approximately 24% of BM CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells were colony-forming in a standard methylcellulose assay, while 51% of mAPH CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells formed colonies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-1031806">Figure 4C</xref> and 
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S3</italic>). However, following LV transduction of these cells using the same protocol proposed for FA-A patient cells, we observed consistent 50% rates of gene transfer into CFCs from both cell product types (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-1031806">Figure 4D</xref>). Analysis of single colonies demonstrated an average VCN per CFC of 0.7 for BM CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells and 1.6 for mAPH CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells. VCN was also assessed in bulk transduced cells cultured for ten days 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, demonstrating an average value of 5 for both BM and mAPH products (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-1031806">Figure 4E</xref>). Final cell products tested for mycoplasma and sterility were negative, and endotoxin testing demonstrated values within criteria for patient infusion. Lineage-depleted and transduced cells from six mAPH and BM products each were infused into immunodeficient (NSG) mice at a target cell dose of 1×10
 <sup>6</sup> TNC per mouse. On average, the CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell dose per mouse for BM products was 2.86×10
 <sup>4</sup> CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells [standard error of the mean (SEM)=6.67×10
 <sup>3</sup>] and for mAPH products was 1.08×10
 <sup>5</sup> CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells (SEM=1.45×10
 <sup>4</sup>). Flow cytometry analysis on peripheral blood was used to evaluate engraftment (human CD45
 <sup>+</sup>) and lineage development into T cells (human CD3
 <sup>+</sup>), B cells (human CD20
 <sup>+</sup>), and monocytes (human CD14
 <sup>+</sup>) over time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-1031806">Figure 4F</xref>). Both mAPH and BM products demonstrated long-term engraftment over 20 weeks of monitoring. Engraftment levels were comparable to results reported by Wiekmeijer 
 <italic>et al</italic>. with CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells purified from BM and infused at similar cell doses.
