<p>These data collectively suggest that lineage-specific depletion preserved available CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells without compromising transduction efficiency or cell fitness. Under FDA approval, the clinical protocol was modified to include both BM and/or mAPH products, with lineage depletion as the method of CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell enrichment. Patient 3 (the first treated under the modified protocol) was a 5-year old male with FA-A confirmed by complementation studies. Baseline neutrophils averaged 1.7×10
 <sup>9</sup>/L and baseline platelets averaged 32×10
 <sup>9</sup>/L in the six months prior to treatment, with declining neutrophils and platelets over the prior 2-year interval (

 <sup>+</sup> cells/ μL peripheral blood was achieved (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S5A</italic>), and two successive apheresis collections resulted in 8.5×10
 <sup>10</sup> TNC containing a total 1.6×10
 <sup>8</sup> CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells (
 <xref rid="t2-1031806" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The patient required a total of two platelet transfusions and two packed red blood cell transfusions during mobilization and leukapheresis (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S5B</italic>). Due to column limitations, 5×10
 <sup>10</sup> TNC (equivalent to 9.5×10
 <sup>7</sup> total CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells) were subjected to lineage depletion, and the remainder were cryopreserved. Lineage depletion resulted in a 94% reduction in TNC and a 56% retention of available CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells. CD34 purity was 1.6%, representing a 1–2 log-fold increase in the total number of CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells per kg available for transduction and infusion relative to Patients 1 and 2 (
 <xref rid="t2-1031806" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). A total of 52.8×10
 <sup>6</sup> CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells were transduced at an MOI of 5 IU/cell, resulting in a final cell dose of 2.4×10
 <sup>6</sup> total CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells per kg with 99.3% viability based on trypan blue dye exclusion. Approximately 26% of CFCs in this cell product were transduced, displaying a mean VCN of approximately 1 (0.9) (
 <xref rid="t3-1031806" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Thus, limited numbers of available CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells were indirectly enriched using lineage depletion on a blood product from an FA-A patient without compromising transduction efficiency.
