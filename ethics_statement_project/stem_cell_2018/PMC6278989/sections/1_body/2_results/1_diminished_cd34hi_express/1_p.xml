<p>Two enrolled patients underwent BM harvest to collect available CD34
 <sup>+</sup> HSPCs (Patients 1 and 2). The third patient underwent mobilization with filgrastim and plerixafor followed by peripheral blood leukapheresis (Patient 3). All 3 patients demonstrated reduced CD34 expression and estimated numbers of CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells in screening BM aspirate samples prior to collection and treatment, relative to healthy donor BM products, as well as in cell products collected for CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell isolation and gene transfer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1031806">Figure 1</xref>). Two levels of CD34 expression were observed, CD34
 <sup>Lo</sup> [mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)=3453±516], and CD34
 <sup>Hi</sup> (MFI=19731±4103). Notably, the proportion of CD34
 <sup>Hi</sup> cells were markedly reduced in FA-A patients relative to those observed in healthy donors (
