<p>In this experiment, healthy donor BM products were divided into two aliquots. One was lineage-depleted and the other CD34-enriched. Resulting cell populations were transduced with the same LV vector under identical conditions and infused into NSG mice at matched CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell doses. We observed higher CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell retention with lineage depletion compared to CD34 selection, with no differences in transduction efficiency or colony-forming potential (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-1031806">Figure 5A and B</xref>). We observed slightly higher, but not significantly different, levels of human CD45
 <sup>+</sup> blood cell engraftment in mice receiving transduced, lineage-depleted cells relative to mice receiving CD34-selected cells. We also observed more stability of T-and B-cell engraftment in mice receiving lineage-depleted cell products relative to mice receiving CD34-selected cell products (
