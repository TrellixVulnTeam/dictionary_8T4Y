<p>We hypothesized that depleting non-target mature B cells, T cells, monocytes, and granulocytes would retain precious CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells with minimal manipulation, since CD34-expressing cells would not be directly labeled, selected, or washed (

 <sup>
  <xref rid="b17-1031806" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
 </sup> we designed a customized, automated RBC debulking and immunomagnetic bead-based lineage specific depletion strategy (

Four different bead-conjugated antibody reagents were used in this approach: anti-CD3 (T-cell removal), anti-CD14 (monocyte removal), anti-CD16 (granulocyte and NK-cell removal), and anti-CD19 (B-cell removal). This protocol was designed for both BM and mAPH products.
