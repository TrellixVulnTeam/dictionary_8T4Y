<p>To determine which CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells demonstrated repopulation potential, we used colony-forming cell (CFC) potential as a surrogate. This required sufficient blood product to flow-sort CD34
 <sup>Lo</sup> and CD34
 <sup>Hi</sup> cells for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. Only the mAPH product collected from Patient 3 was sufficient for this study. For direct comparison, we sort-purified CD34
 <sup>Lo</sup> and CD34
 <sup>Hi</sup> cells from a healthy donor mAPH product. Only CD34
 <sup>Hi</sup> cells from the FA-A patient demonstrated colony-forming potential (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-1031806">Figure 2A</xref>). In the healthy donor, CD34
 <sup>Hi</sup> cells also demonstrated the majority of CFC capacity in comparison with CD34
 <sup>Lo</sup> cells, and at much higher levels as compared to the FA-A patient (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-1031806">Figure 2B</xref>). These data suggest repopulating capacity is restricted to CD34
 <sup>Hi</sup> cell fractions, underscoring the need to preserve as many of these cells as possible for gene transfer processes.
