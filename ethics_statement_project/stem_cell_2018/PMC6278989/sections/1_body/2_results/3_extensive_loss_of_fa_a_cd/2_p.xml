<p>In Patient 2, estimated losses during direct CD34 enrichment and gene transfer were expected to reduce the cell product available for transduction to a level lower than observed for Patient 1. Thus, an urgent amendment was filed with the FDA to permit elimination of the direct CD34 enrichment steps and allow transduction of the entire red blood cell (RBC)-depleted BM product. This processing change preserved more CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells (

 <sup>+</sup> cells from FA-A patients could improve yield, gene transfer efficiency, and function
