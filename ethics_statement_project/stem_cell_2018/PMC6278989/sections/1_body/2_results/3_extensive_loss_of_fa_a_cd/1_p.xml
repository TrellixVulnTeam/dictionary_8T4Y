<p>The current clinical standard for CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell enrichment is optimized for collection of CD34
 <sup>Hi</sup> cells. However, in Patient 1, direct enrichment of CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells using this protocol was inefficient, resulting in an approximately 3% yield and only 5.34Ã—10
 <sup>6</sup> total CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells available for gene transfer (
 <xref rid="t2-1031806" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Moreover, the purity of the enriched cell product was only 58.9%, and approximately 47% loss in viable cells was observed during culture and gene transfer. Resulting gene-modified cells retained colony-forming capacity and demonstrated acquired resistance to the potent DNA crosslinking agent MMC following LV-mediated FANCA gene transfer (
