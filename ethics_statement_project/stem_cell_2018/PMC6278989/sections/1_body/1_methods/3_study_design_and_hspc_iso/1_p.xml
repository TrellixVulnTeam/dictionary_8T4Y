<p>Patients underwent either BM harvest with a target collection goal of 15 cc/kg body weight or were administered daily G-CSF (filgrastim; 16 μg/kg BID; days 1–6) and plerixafor (240 μg/kg/day; days 4–6) subcutaneously to mobilize CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells. Mobilized patients were subjected to large volume leukapheresis when circulating CD34
 <sup>+</sup> blood cell counts were ≥5 cells/ μL. Healthy donor blood products were purchased from a commercial source (BM products; StemExpress, Folsom, CA, USA) or institutional shared resources (mAPH products). Immunomagnetic beads were from Miltenyi Biotech, GmbH (Auburn, CA, USA). For BM products, RBC were debulked by hetastarch sedimentation prior to labeling on a CliniMACS Prodigy™ device (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Germany). For mAPH products, an initial platelet wash was performed prior to labeling. Custom programming for lineage depletion was designed and executed on the CliniMACS Prodigy™ device (Miltenyi Biotec, GmbH). Complete processing methods are included in the
