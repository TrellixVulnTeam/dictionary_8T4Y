 <sup>2</sup> in StemSpan™ ACF media (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada), supplemented with 4 μg/mL of protamine sulfate (American Pharmaceutical Partners; APP, East Shaumburg, IL, USA), 100 ng/mL each of recombinant human stem cell factor (rhSCF), thrombopoietin (rhTPO) and Flt-3 ligand (rhFLT3L) (all from CellGenix GmbH, Freiburg, Germany), and 1 mM NAC (Cumberland Pharmaceuticals, Nashville, TN, USA). Cells were immediately transduced at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5–10 infectious units (IU)/cell. Following 12–24 hours of incubation at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and 5% O
 <sub>2</sub>, cells were harvested for infusion and/or analyses.
