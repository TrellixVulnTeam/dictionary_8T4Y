<p>All SIN lentiviral (LV) vectors were produced with a third-generation split packaging system and pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein. LV used to transduce healthy donor cells encoded either an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) transgene (pRSC-PGK.eGFP-sW) or the full-length 
 <italic>FANCA</italic> cDNA (pRSC-PGK.FANCA-sW), both regulated by an hPGK promoter. Research-grade vectors were produced by the Fred Hutch Vector Production Core (Principal Investigator: HPK). Clinical-grade LV (pRSC-PGK. 
 <italic>FANCA</italic>-sW), was produced by the Indiana University Vector Production Facility (IUVPF, IN, USA) using a large-scale, validated process following Good Manufacturing Practices standards under an approved Drug Master File held by IUVPF. Infectious titer was determined by serial transduction of HT1080 human fibrosarcoma-derived cells and evaluated either by flow cytometry for eGFP expression or by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
