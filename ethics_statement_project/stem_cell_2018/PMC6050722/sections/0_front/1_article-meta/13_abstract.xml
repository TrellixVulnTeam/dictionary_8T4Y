  <p id="Par1">UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A subfamily (UGT1A) enzymes can inactivate cytarabine (Ara-C) by glucuronidation, and thus serves as candidate genes for interindividual difference in Ara-C response. UGT1A1 is a major UGT1A isoform expressed in human liver.</p>

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2">
   <italic>UGT1A1*6</italic> and 
   <italic>*28</italic> polymorphisms resulting in reduced UGT1A1 activity were genotyped in 726 adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients treated with Ara-C based regimens. Influences of both polymorphisms on chemosensitivity and disease prognosis of the patients were evaluated.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p id="Par3">After one or two courses of Ara-C based induction chemotherapy, the complete remission (CR) rate was significantly higher in patients carrying the 
   <italic>UGT1A1*6</italic> (77.0%) or the 
   <italic>UGT1A1*28</italic> (76.4%) alleles as compared with corresponding wild-type homozygotes (66.9 and 68.5%, respectively). Carriers of the 
   <italic>UGT1A1*6</italic> or 
   <italic>*28</italic> alleles showed significantly decreased risk of non-CR (OR = 0.528, 95% CI 0.379–0.737, 
   <italic>P </italic>= 1.7 × 10
   <sup>−4</sup>) and better overall survival (HR = 0.787, 95% CI 0.627–0.990, 
   <italic>P</italic> = 0.040) as compared with homozygotes for both polymorphisms.

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p id="Par4">Our results suggest that 
   <italic>UGT1A1*28</italic> and 
   <italic>UGT1A1*6</italic> are associated with improved clinical outcomes in Chinese AML patients treated with Ara-C.
