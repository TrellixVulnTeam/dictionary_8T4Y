<p id="Par60">A total of 726 AML patients were eligible and adopted in the study. The baseline characteristics of the patients were summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The mean age of the patients was 41 years, and 78 patients (10.7%) were aged 60 or more. M2 (51.2%) was the most frequent French–American–British (FAB) subtype for the patients, followed by M4 (20.5%) and M5 (20.1%). Risk stratification based on cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities was available for 622 patients: 152 low risk, 330 intermediate risk, and 140 high risk.

 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2. During the first induction therapy, 692 patients received standard-dose Ara-C with anthracycline or mitoxantrone regimens, and 34 (4.7%) patients received low-intensity regimens of decitabine and subcutaneous Ara-C. G-CSF was given to 137 (18.9%) patients simultaneously to avoid myelosupression (Additional file
