 <italic>UGT1A1*6</italic> and 
 <italic>UGT1A1*28</italic> polymorphisms were genotyped in the patient cohort. For the 
 <italic>UGT1A1*6</italic> polymorphism, genotype frequencies for the 
 <italic>*1/*1</italic>, 
 <italic>*1/*6</italic>, and 
 <italic>*6/*6</italic> were 493 (67.9%), 209 (28.8%), and 24 (3.3%), respectively. For the 
 <italic>UGT1A1*28</italic> polymorphism, genotype frequencies for the 
 <italic>*1/*1</italic>, 
 <italic>*1/*28</italic> and 
 <italic>*28/*28</italic> were 79.8% (579 patients), 18.2% (132 patients), and 2.0% (15 patients), respectively. The genotype distribution was in accordance with HWE for the 
 <italic>UGT1A1*6</italic> polymorphism (
 <italic>P </italic>= 0.819) but not the 
 <italic>UGT1A1*28</italic> polymorphism (
 <italic>P </italic>= 0.048). No obvious linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the two polymorphisms was observed (r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.027). Overall, no significant difference in baseline characteristics was observed between patients carrying the wild-type and mutant 
 <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotypes (Table
