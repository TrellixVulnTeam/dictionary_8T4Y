<p id="Par65">Association of the 
 <italic>UGT1A1</italic> polymorphisms with OS and EFS of the AML patients was also analyzed. In univariate analysis, patients carrying the 
 <italic>UGT1A1*28</italic> allele (
 <italic>P </italic>= 0.047) or carrying at least one of the 
 <italic>UGT1A1*28</italic> and 
 <italic>UGT1A1*6</italic> alleles (
 <italic>P </italic>= 0.007) showed significantly better OS (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), carriers of the 
 <italic>UGT1A1*6</italic> allele alone showed marginally better OS (
 <italic>P </italic>= 0.091, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e). Median OS was 727 days (range 530–924 day) for carriers of the 
 <italic>UGT1A1*28</italic> or 
 <italic>UGT1A1*6</italic> alleles, and was 514 days (range 427–601 day) for the 
 <italic>UGT1A1*1/*1</italic> homozygotes. In cox proportional hazards model, carrier of at least one of the 
 <italic>UGT1A1*28</italic> and 
 <italic>UGT1A1*6</italic> alleles showed better OS (HR = 0.787, 95% CI 0.627–0.990, 
 <italic>P </italic>= 0.04), while high risk stratification, WBC count and age were associated with worse OS (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). High risk stratification was also associated with worse EFS (HR = 1.652, 95% CI 1.188–2.297, 
 <italic>P </italic>= 0.003) for the patients. Neither 
 <italic>UGT1A1*28</italic> nor 
 <italic>UGT1A1*6</italic> polymorphism was associated with EFS of the patients (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Fig. S1).
