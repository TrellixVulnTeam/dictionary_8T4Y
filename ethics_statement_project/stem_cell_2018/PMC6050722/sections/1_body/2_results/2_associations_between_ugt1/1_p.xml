<p id="Par63">Comparisons of response to two courses of induction therapy among the 
 <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotypes were shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Patients carrying the 
 <italic>UGT1A1*6</italic> allele (
 <italic>*1/*6</italic> + 
 <italic>*6/*6</italic> genotypes) showed significantly higher CR rate after two cycles of induction therapy compared to those carrying the 
 <italic>*1/*1</italic> genotype (77.0% vs 66.9%, 
 <italic>P </italic>= 0.007). Similarly, carriers of the 
 <italic>UGT1A1*28</italic> allele (
 <italic>*1/*28 </italic>+ 
 <italic>*28/*28</italic> genotypes) also showed marginally significantly increased CR rate than the 
 <italic>*1/*1</italic> homozygotes (76.4% vs 68.5%, 
 <italic>P </italic>= 0.068). When combined genotypes for both polymorphisms were considered, wildtype homozygotes for both polymorphisms showed the lowest CR rate (63.8%), carries of the 
 <italic>UTG1A1*6</italic> alone, 
 <italic>UTG1A1*28</italic> alone, and each of the variant allele (
 <italic>*6</italic> or 
 <italic>*28</italic>) showed a CR rate of 77.3, 76.8, and 76.9%, respectively. Results of unconditional logistic regression showed that carriers of 
 <italic>UTG1A1*6</italic> showed significantly reduced risk of non-CR (OR = 0.604; 95% CI 0.419–0.869, 
 <italic>P </italic>= 0.007), and carriers of the 
 <italic>UTG1A1*28</italic> showed marginally decreased risk of non-CR (OR = 0.673, 95% CI 0.440–1.029, 
 <italic>P </italic>= 0.068) as compared with corresponding wildtype genotype. As the two polymorphisms showed low LD in our patients, association of the combined genotypes with non-CR risk was also analyzed. Significantly decreased risk of non-CR was observed in patients carrying the 
 <italic>UGT1A1*6</italic> or 
 <italic>*28</italic> alleles as compared with homozygotes for both polymorphisms (OR = 0.528, 95% CI 0.379–0.737, 
 <italic>P </italic>= 1.7 × 10

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Patients with the 
 <italic>UGT1A1*28/</italic>− or 
 <italic>*6/</italic>− also showed decreased risk of non-CR after the first induction therapy (OR = 0.672, 95% CI 0.498–0.907, 
 <italic>P </italic>= 0.009, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3). No significant difference in TRM among the 
 <italic>UGT1A1*6</italic> and 
 <italic>UGT1A1*28</italic> genotypes was observed (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S4).
