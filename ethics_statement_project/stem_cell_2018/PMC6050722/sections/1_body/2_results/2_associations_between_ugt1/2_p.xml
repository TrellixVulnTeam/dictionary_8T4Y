<p id="Par64">When adjusted by clinical factors, results of multivariate analysis showed that AML risk stratification, pretreatment WBC count, 
 <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotypes based on *6 and *28 concomitantly, and age showed significant association with non-CR risk after two-courses of induction therapy (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). In details, carriers of the 
 <italic>UGT1A1</italic>*6 or *28 allele showed decreased risk of non-CR (OR = 0.547, 95% CI 0.375–0.797, 
 <italic>P </italic>= 0.002); low risk stratification and high risk stratification showed decreased (OR = 0.457, 95% CI 0.269–0.776, 
 <italic>P </italic>= 0.004) and increased (OR = 2.045, 95% CI 1.331–3.140, 
 <italic>P </italic>= 0.001) risk of non-CR, respectively, as compared with intermediate risk stratification; pretreatment WBC count and age was associated with increased risk of non-CR (WBC count: OR = 1.004, 95% CI 1.001–1.007, 
 <italic>P </italic>= 0.008 for; Age: OR = 1.014, 95% CI 1.001–1.028, 
 <italic>P </italic>= 0.036). Association between 
 <italic>UGT1A1</italic>*6 or *28 carrying status, risk stratification and pretreatment WBC count were also associated with risk of non-CR for the first induction therapy (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).
