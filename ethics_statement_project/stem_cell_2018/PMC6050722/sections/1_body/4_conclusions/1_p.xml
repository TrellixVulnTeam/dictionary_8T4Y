<p id="Par71">In summary, we identified 
 <italic>UGT1A1</italic> functional variants as independent factors for better response to Ara-C based chemotherapy and disease prognosis in Chinese AML patients. These findings provide new insightful information for individualized chemotherapy for AML patients. Consideration the ethnic difference in allele frequencies of the 
 <italic>UGT1A</italic> polymorphisms, the positive findings in our study deserved further validation in AML patient cohorts with different ethnic background. Future prospective studies to evaluate influence of 
 <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotypes on pharmacokinetics and metabolism of Ara-C are also warranted to explore the exact mechanisms of our clinical findings.
