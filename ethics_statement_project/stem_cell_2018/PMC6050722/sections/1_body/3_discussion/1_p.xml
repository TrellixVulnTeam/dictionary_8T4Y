<p id="Par66">UGT1A is a newly identified enzyme subfamily that is involved in Ara-C detoxification. In this study, we performed an association study on 
 <italic>UGT1A1</italic> polymorphisms with responses to Ara-C and disease prognosis in AML patients for the first time. We observed that carriers of the 
 <italic>UGT1A1*6</italic> variant or carriers of any of the 
 <italic>UGT1A1*6</italic> and 
 <italic>UGT1A1*28</italic> alleles showed significantly decreased risk of non-CR after one and two courses of Ara-C based induction chemotherapy for AML patients. We also observed that carriers of the 
 <italic>UGT1A1*6</italic> or 
 <italic>UGT1A1*28</italic> alleles showed significantly better OS in AML patients.
