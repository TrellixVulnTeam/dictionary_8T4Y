<p id="Par69">We noticed that the predictive value of 
 <italic>UGT1A1*28</italic> and 
 <italic>*6</italic> polymorphisms on CR after Ara-C based induction therapy is modest in AML patients (CR rate 76.9% in carriers of the 
 <italic>UGT1A1*28</italic> and 
 <italic>*6</italic> alleles and 63.8% in 
 <italic>UGT1A1*1/*1</italic> for both loci), and the association of 
 <italic>UGT1A1*28</italic> alone with non-CR risk was nonsignificant after Bonferroni correction for two SNPs (significance set at 
 <italic>P </italic>&lt; 0.05/2 for 2 SNPs). This may be explained by two reasons: firstly, the lower allele frequency of the 
 <italic>UGT1A1*28</italic> polymorphism in our patient cohort. Secondly, the multigenic characteristic of drug response including Ara-C. In our previous studies, we observed that polymorphisms in other genes encoding enzymes in the Ara-C metabolic pathway such as 
 <italic>DCK</italic>, 
 <italic>NME2</italic> (DNPK-B), 
 <italic>RRM2</italic>, and 
 <italic>SAMHD1</italic> are also associated drug response to Ara-C based therapies in AML [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We suggest that the construction of a decision tree based on multiple genetic variations concomitantly may increase the predictive values of pharmacogenetics biomarkers in AML induction therapy. Of course, the exact usefulness requires to be explored with a large sample size.
