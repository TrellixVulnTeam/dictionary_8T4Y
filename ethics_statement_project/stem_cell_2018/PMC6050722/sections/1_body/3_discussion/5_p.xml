<p id="Par70">Regarding disease prognosis including OS and EFS, we observed better OS in carriers of 
 <italic>UGT1A1*28</italic>, or carriers of at least one of the 
 <italic>UGT1A1*6</italic> and 
 <italic>*28</italic> alleles. Neither polymorphisms nor the combined genotypes were associated with EFS in our study. As EFS was considered only in patients achieved CR after induction therapies, lack of association between 
 <italic>UGT1A1</italic> polymorphisms and EFS observed in our study suggests other mechanisms other than chemosensitivity might also play a role in AML prognosis.
