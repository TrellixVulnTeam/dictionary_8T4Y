<p id="Par51">Ara-C is a prodrug and undergoes biotransformation into the active metabolite cytarabine triphosphate (Ara-CTP) to exert its pharmacological activity; the latter can incorporate into replicating DNA and interfere with DNA synthesis, resulting in apoptosis of cells. Three kinases are required to accomplish intracellular phosphorylation of Ara-C to the formation of Ara-CTP: the rate-limiting enzyme deoxycytidine kinase (DCK), deoxycytidine monophosphate kinase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], cytidine deaminase (CDA) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] are the major deactivating enzymes of Ara-C that act through prevention of the formation or directly increase the degradation of the active triphosphate metabolite. Alteration in the activity of enzymes involved in Ara-C metabolism may result in a change in the proportion of its active form in the cells, and thus affects both sensitivity and toxicity of Ara-C in AML patients receiving Ara-C based chemotherapy [
