<p id="Par50">Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous hematological malignance derived from the hemopoietic progenitors with highly diverse clinical traits, molecular pathogenesis and clinical outcomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Apart from known prognostic factors including age, white blood cell (WBC) counts, complex karyotype, antecedent hematologic disease and secondary leukemia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], accumulated evidence has shown that the presence of somatic mutations in genes such as fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (
 <italic>FLT3</italic>), nucleophosmin 1 (
 <italic>NPM1</italic>), CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (
 <italic>CEBPA</italic>), KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase (
 <italic>KIT</italic>), tumor protein p53 (
 <italic>TP53)</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (
 <italic>DNMT3a</italic>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] have clinical prognostic significance. Chemotherapy with cytarabine (Ara-C) based regimen remains the major therapy for AML except for the M3 subtype, and the complete remission (CR)Â rate varies between 60 and 70% for the adult patients during induction therapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Half of the patients achieved CR in primarily induction chemotherapy relapsed due to the existence of minimal residual disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Overall long-term survival rate of AML ranges from 21.9 to 44% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Primary or acquired chemoresistance is the major problem faced in AML treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, identification of factors related to Ara-C-resistance and better elucidation of potential mechanisms involved in Ara-C resistance will help optimize regimens for treatment of AML and improve the clinical outcomes as well.
