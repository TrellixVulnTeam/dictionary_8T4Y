<p id="Par52">The Hedgehog (HH)/Glioma-associated Oncogene Homolog (GLI) signaling pathway that plays a role in chemotherapy resistance and cellular self-renewal is supposed to be a novel therapeutic target in AML [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In a phase 2 clinical trial with AML and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients, combined therapy with low dose Ara-C and a selective HH/GLI pathway inhibitor glasdegib is observed to improve overall survival (OS) as compared with Ara-C treatment alone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Our recent study also showed that GLI1 expression was upregulated in bone marrow mononuclear cells from patients with refractory or relapsed AML, and GLI1 inhibition is sufficient to increase Ara-C sensitivity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, Zahreddine and colleagues demonstrated that UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A subfamily (UGT1A) enzymes can inactivate Ara-C through glucuronidation in leukemia cells, and GLI1 is involved in Ara-c resistance through enhancing the stability of UGT1A enzymes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, there is no report on associations of genetic polymorphisms in

 <italic>UGT1A</italic> subfamily with Ara-C presently.
