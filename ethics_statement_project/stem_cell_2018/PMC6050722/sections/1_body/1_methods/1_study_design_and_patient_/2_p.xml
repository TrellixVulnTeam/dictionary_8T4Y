<p id="Par56">The patients &gt; 14 years of old of age, diagnosed with de novo AML or secondary AML (according to the WHO criteria), and were planned to be treated with Ara-C based induction chemotherapy were enrolled. Those diagnosed as acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3 AML), therapy-related AML (T-AML), acute mixed lineage leukemia, or accompanied by other serious diseases were excluded from this study. For the induction therapy, patients received a standard-dose of Ara-C (100–200 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> continuous infusion × 7 days) in combination with one of the anthracyclines (daunorubicin 45–90 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup>, or idarubicin 10–20 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup>, or aclarubicin 20 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup>, or pirarubicin 30 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup>, or mitoxantrone 8–16 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> × 3 day). Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) were used for some patients for the prevention or treatment of myelosuppression. Some elderly patients received low-intensity therapy regimens included low-dose Ara-C (10–20 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> × 14 days) were also enrolled. Once CR was achieved, the patients were treated with sequential consolidation therapy consisting of Ara-C and anthracyclines or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Clinical information of the patients was collected from the medical records, regular outpatient review, and trimonthly telephone following-up. All clinical events were recorded at least once per 3 months and the follow-up ended on Nov 31st, 2017. A flow diagram of the process for participant recruitment was illustrated in Additional file
