In the previous analysis of the ZUMA-1 registrational study, with a median follow-up of 15\u00b74 months (IQR 13\u00b77-17\u00b73), 89 (82%) of 108 assessable patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel achieved an objective response, and complete responses were noted in 63 (58%) patients. Here we report long-term activity and safety outcomes of the ZUMA-1 study.<h4>Methods</h4>ZUMA-1 is a single-arm, multicentre, registrational trial at 22 sites in the USA and Israel. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, and had histologically confirmed large B-cell lymphoma-including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, and transformed follicular lymphoma-according to the 2008 WHO Classification of Tumors of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissue; refractory disease or relapsed after autologous stem-cell transplantation; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1; and had previously received an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody containing-regimen and an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. Participants received one dose of axicabtagene ciloleucel on day 0 at a target dose of 2\u2008\u00d7\u200810<sup>6</sup> CAR T cells per kg of bodyweight after conditioning chemotherapy with intravenous fludarabine (30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> body-surface area) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> body-surface area) on days -5, -4, and -3. The primary endpoints were safety for phase 1 and the proportion of patients achieving an objective response for phase 2, and key secondary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival, and duration of response. Pre-planned activity and safety analyses were done per protocol. ZUMA-1 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02348216. Although the registrational cohorts are closed, the trial remains open, and recruitment to extension cohorts with alternative endpoints is underway.<h4>Findings</h4>Between May 19, 2015, and Sept 15, 2016, 119 patients were enrolled and 108 received axicabtagene ciloleucel across phases 1 and 2. As of the cutoff date of Aug 11, 2018, 101 patients assessable for activity in phase 2 were followed up for a median of 27\u00b71 months (IQR 25\u00b77-28\u00b78), 84 (83%) had an objective response, and 59 (58%) had a complete response. The median duration of response was 11\u00b71 months (4\u00b72-not estimable). The median overall survival was not reached (12\u00b78-not estimable), and the median progression-free survival was 5\u00b79 months (95% CI 3\u00b73-15\u00b70). 52 (48%) of 108 patients assessable for safety in phases 1 and 2 had grade 3 or worse serious adverse events. Grade 3 or worse cytokine release syndrome occurred in 12 (11%) patients, and grade 3 or worse neurological events in 35 (32%). Since the previous analysis at 1 year, additional serious adverse events were reported in four patients (grade 3 mental status changes, grade 4 myelodysplastic syndrome, grade 3 lung infection, and two episodes of grade 3 bacteraemia), none of which were judged to be treatment related. Two treatment-related deaths (due to haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and cardiac arrest) were previously reported, but no new treatment-related deaths occurred during the additional follow-up.<h4>Interpretation</h4>These 2-year follow-up data from ZUMA-1 suggest that axicabtagene ciloleucel can induce durable responses and a median overall survival of greater than 2 years, and has a manageable long-term safety profile in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma.<h4>Funding</h4>Kite and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Therapy Acceleration Program.", "affiliation": "Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.

Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, and had histologically confirmed large B-cell lymphoma-including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, and transformed follicular lymphoma-according to the 2008 WHO Classification of Tumors of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissue; refractory disease or relapsed after autologous stem-cell transplantation; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1; and had previously received an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody containing-regimen and an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. Participants received one dose of axicabtagene ciloleucel on day 0 at a target dose of 2\u2008\u00d7\u200810<sup>6</sup> CAR T cells per kg of bodyweight after conditioning chemotherapy with intravenous fludarabine (30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> body-surface area) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> body-surface area) on days -5, -4, and -3. The primary endpoints were safety for phase 1 and the proportion of patients achieving an objective response for phase 2, and key secondary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival, and duration of response. Pre-planned activity and safety analyses were done per protocol. ZUMA-1 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02348216. Although the registrational cohorts are closed, the trial remains open, and recruitment to extension cohorts with alternative endpoints is underway.<h4>Findings</h4>Between May 19, 2015, and Sept 15, 2016, 119 patients were enrolled and 108 received axicabtagene ciloleucel across phases 1 and 2. As of the cutoff date of Aug 11, 2018, 101 patients assessable for activity in phase 2 were followed up for a median of 27\u00b71 months (IQR 25\u00b77-28\u00b78), 84 (83%) had an objective response, and 59 (58%) had a complete response. The median duration of response was 11\u00b71 months (4\u00b72-not estimable). The median overall survival was not reached (12\u00b78-not estimable), and the median progression-free survival was 5\u00b79 months (95% CI 3\u00b73-15\u00b70). 52 (48%) of 108 patients assessable for safety in phases 1 and 2 had grade 3 or worse serious adverse events. Grade 3 or worse cytokine release syndrome occurred in 12 (11%) patients, and grade 3 or worse neurological events in 35 (32%). Since the previous analysis at 1 year, additional serious adverse events were reported in four patients (grade 3 mental status changes, grade 4 myelodysplastic syndrome, grade 3 lung infection, and two episodes of grade 3 bacteraemia), none of which were judged to be treatment related. Two treatment-related deaths (due to haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and cardiac arrest) were previously reported, but no new treatment-related deaths occurred during the additional follow-up.<h4>Interpretation</h4>These 2-year follow-up data from ZUMA-1 suggest that axicabtagene ciloleucel can induce durable responses and a median overall survival of greater than 2 years, and has a manageable long-term safety profile in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma.<h4>Funding</h4>Kite and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Therapy Acceleration Program.", "journaltitle": "The Lancet.

This adverse cytotoxic effect manifests as oral mucosal erythema and ulcerations and frequently necessitates high doses of morphine for pain alleviation. OM may also interfere with food intake and result in parenteral nutrition, weight loss and impaired quality of life. To date, there have been a few studies of evidence-based interventions for prevention of OM. Cooling the oral mucosa using ice chips in conjunction with chemotherapy is known to reduce the severity of OM although clinical application is still limited due to several disadvantages. The primary endpoint of this study is therefore to evaluate the efficacy of an innovative intraoral cooling device (Cooral) compared with ice cooling in reducing the degree of OM, in patients with myeloma or lymphoma.<h4>Method and analysis</h4>A total of 180 patients from four different university hospitals in Sweden will be randomised to ice or Cooral in a proportion of 1:1. The degree of OM will be assessed at eight intraoral locations, in accordance with the Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale and WHO scale.

This adverse cytotoxic effect manifests as oral mucosal erythema and ulcerations and frequently necessitates high doses of morphine for pain alleviation. OM may also interfere with food intake and result in parenteral nutrition, weight loss and impaired quality of life. To date, there have been a few studies of evidence-based interventions for prevention of OM. Cooling the oral mucosa using ice chips in conjunction with chemotherapy is known to reduce the severity of OM although clinical application is still limited due to several disadvantages. The primary endpoint of this study is therefore to evaluate the efficacy of an innovative intraoral cooling device (Cooral) compared with ice cooling in reducing the degree of OM, in patients with myeloma or lymphoma.<h4>Method and analysis</h4>A total of 180 patients from four different university hospitals in Sweden will be randomised to ice or Cooral in a proportion of 1:1. The degree of OM will be assessed at eight intraoral locations, in accordance with the Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale and WHO scale. Patients will be registered beginning at admission and will continue until discharge or until day +28. The primary variable is analysed in a multiple linear regression model. The significance level used is 5%.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>The study protocol, questionnaire, diaries and letter of invitation to participants have been reviewed by the local ethical board in G\u00f6teborg.

Accumulating data are showing different postradiotherapy changes in the left and right hippocampus with a theoretical proposal of only unilateral (dominant, left) hippocampal sparing during WBRT.<h4>Method</h4>The aim of this retrospective study is to describe spatial distribution of brain metastases on MRI in a cohort of 260 patients (2595 metastases) and to evaluate distribution separately in the left and right hippocampus and in respective hippocampal avoiding zones (HAZ, region with subtherapeutic radiation dose), including evaluation of location of metastatic mass centre.<h4>Results</h4>The median number of brain metastases was three, with lung cancer being the most common type of primary tumour; 36% had single metastasis. Almost 8% of patients had metastasis within hippocampus (1.1% of all metastases) and 18.1% of patients within HAZ (3.3% of all metastases). No statistically significant difference was observed in the laterality of hippocampal involvement, also when the location of centre of metastases was analyzed. There were more patients presenting the centre of metastasis within left (15) versus right (6) HAZ approaching the borderline of statistical significance.<h4>Conclusion</h4>No significant difference in the laterality of BM seeding within hippocampal structures was observed.

Corticosteroids are the most widely recommended treatment for severe AH. However, more innovative, refined treatment measures are required because of its high mortality despite corticosteroid treatment. This study aims to determine whether granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment increases short-term survival in patients with severe AH refractory to corticosteroid treatment.<h4>Methods/design</h4>Patients with severe AH whose Maddrey's discriminant function (MDF) score is \u2265\u200932 and who will be treated with prednisolone (40\u2009mg/day) for 1\u2009week will be screened.

Study subjects in the PR group will be treated with prednisolone for 28\u2009days followed by dose tapering for an additional 2\u2009weeks. The primary endpoint is the 2-month survival rate in the NR group and the 6-month survival rate in the PR group. Child-Turcotte-Pugh, model for end-stage liver disease score, and the change in the proportion of peripheral circulating CD34-positive cells will be analyzed as risk factors for mortality. Preliminary safety data for the initial 10 study subjects enrolled in the PR study will be assessed to determine whether the PR study would be continued, according to the G-CSF-mobilized, peripheral-blood stem cell donor assessment protocol of the National Marrow Donor Program.<h4>Discussion</h4>We hypothesized that G-CSF would prolong short-term survival of patients with severe AH refractory to corticosteroid treatment. This is a proof-of-concept trial designed to assess the efficacy of Lille-score-guided G-CSF treatment.

Although many salvage regimens have been developed, there is no standard of care. Brentuximab vedotin and gemcitabine have been shown to be active in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma when used as monotherapy, and each has been successfully used in combination with other agents. Preclinical data suggest that brentuximab vedotin can sensitise lymphoma cells to gemcitabine, supporting the use of the combination. We aimed to define the safety and efficacy of brentuximab vedotin with gemcitabine in children and young adults with primary refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma or early relapse.<h4>Methods</h4>In this Children's Oncology Group, multicentre, single-arm, phase 1-2 trial, we recruited patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma from hospitals across the USA and Canada. Eligible patients were aged younger than 30 years, had no previous brentuximab vedotin exposure, and had primary refractory disease or relapse of less than 1 year from completion of initial treatment. Each 21-day cycle consisted of 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenous gemcitabine on days 1 and 8 and intravenous brentuximab vedotin on day 1 at 1\u00b74 mg/kg or 1\u00b78 mg/kg. The primary objectives were to establish the recommended phase 2 dose of brentuximab vedotin in this combination, the safety of the combination, and the proportion of patients who achieved a complete response among those treated at the recommended phase 2 level, within four cycles of treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01780662.<h4>Findings</h4>Between Feb 5, 2013, and Aug 19, 2016, 46 patients were enrolled, including one who was found to be ineligible, in the two phases of the study. The recommended phase 2 dose of brentuximab vedotin was 1\u00b78 mg/kg in combination with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. 24 (57%) of 42 evaluable patients (95% CI 41-72) given this dose level had a complete response within the first four cycles of treatment. Four (31%) of 13 patients with a partial response or stable disease had all target lesions with Deauville scores of 3 or less after cycle 4. By modern response criteria, these were also complete responses (total number with complete response 28 [67%] of 42 [95% CI 51-80]). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in all 42 participants treated at the recommended phase 2 dose were neutropenia (15 [36%]), rash (15 [36%]), transaminitis (9 [21%]), and pruritus (4 [10%]).

Although many salvage regimens have been developed, there is no standard of care. Brentuximab vedotin and gemcitabine have been shown to be active in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma when used as monotherapy, and each has been successfully used in combination with other agents. Preclinical data suggest that brentuximab vedotin can sensitise lymphoma cells to gemcitabine, supporting the use of the combination. We aimed to define the safety and efficacy of brentuximab vedotin with gemcitabine in children and young adults with primary refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma or early relapse.<h4>Methods</h4>In this Children's Oncology Group, multicentre, single-arm, phase 1-2 trial, we recruited patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma from hospitals across the USA and Canada. Eligible patients were aged younger than 30 years, had no previous brentuximab vedotin exposure, and had primary refractory disease or relapse of less than 1 year from completion of initial treatment. Each 21-day cycle consisted of 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenous gemcitabine on days 1 and 8 and intravenous brentuximab vedotin on day 1 at 1\u00b74 mg/kg or 1\u00b78 mg/kg. The primary objectives were to establish the recommended phase 2 dose of brentuximab vedotin in this combination, the safety of the combination, and the proportion of patients who achieved a complete response among those treated at the recommended phase 2 level, within four cycles of treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01780662.<h4>Findings</h4>Between Feb 5, 2013, and Aug 19, 2016, 46 patients were enrolled, including one who was found to be ineligible, in the two phases of the study. The recommended phase 2 dose of brentuximab vedotin was 1\u00b78 mg/kg in combination with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. 24 (57%) of 42 evaluable patients (95% CI 41-72) given this dose level had a complete response within the first four cycles of treatment. Four (31%) of 13 patients with a partial response or stable disease had all target lesions with Deauville scores of 3 or less after cycle 4. By modern response criteria, these were also complete responses (total number with complete response 28 [67%] of 42 [95% CI 51-80]). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in all 42 participants treated at the recommended phase 2 dose were neutropenia (15 [36%]), rash (15 [36%]), transaminitis (9 [21%]), and pruritus (4 [10%]). There were no treatment-related deaths.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Brentuximab vedotin with gemcitabine is a safe combination treatment with a tolerable toxicity profile for patients with primary refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma or high-risk relapse.

A beneficial effect of lenalidomide maintenance therapy on overall survival in this setting has been inconsistent between individual studies. Minimal data are available on the effect of maintenance lenalidomide in more aggressive disease states, such as patients with cytogenetic high-risk disease or patients ineligible for transplantation. We aimed to assess lenalidomide maintenance versus observation in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, including cytogenetic risk and transplantation status subgroup analyses. METHODS:The Myeloma XI trial was an open-label, randomised, phase 3, adaptive design trial with three randomisation stages done at 110 National Health Service hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland. There were three potential randomisations in the study: induction treatment (allocation by transplantation eligibility status); intensification treatment (allocation by response to induction therapy); and maintenance treatment. Here, we report the results of the randomisation to maintenance treatment. Eligible patients for maintenance randomisation were aged 18 years or older and had symptomatic or non-secretory multiple myeloma, had completed their assigned induction therapy as per protocol and had achieved at least a minimal response to protocol treatment, including lenalidomide. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1 from Jan 13, 2011, to Jun 27, 2013, and 2:1 from Jun 28, 2013, to Aug 11, 2017) to lenalidomide maintenance (10 mg orally on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle) or observation, and stratified by allocated induction and intensification treatment, and centre. The co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival and overall survival, analysed by intention to treat. Safety analysis was per protocol. This study is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN49407852, and clinicaltrialsregister.eu, number 2009-010956-93, and has completed recruitment. FINDINGS:Between Jan 13, 2011, and Aug 11, 2017, 1917 patients were accrued to the maintenance treatment randomisation of the trial. 1137 patients were assigned to lenalidomide maintenance and 834 patients to observation. After a median follow-up of 31 months (IQR 18-50), median progression-free survival was 39 months (95% CI 36-42) with lenalidomide and 20 months (18-22) with observation (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b746 [95% CI 0\u00b741-0\u00b753]; p<0\u00b70001), and 3-year overall survival was 78\u00b76% (95% Cl 75\u00b76-81\u00b76) in the lenalidomide group and 75\u00b78% (72\u00b74-79\u00b72) in the observation group (HR 0\u00b787 [95% CI 0\u00b773-1\u00b705]; p=0\u00b715). Progression-free survival was improved with lenalidomide compared with observation across all prespecified subgroups. On prespecified subgroup analyses by transplantation status, 3-year overall survival in transplantation-eligible patients was 87\u00b75% (95% Cl 84\u00b73-90\u00b77) in the lenalidomide group and 80\u00b72% (76\u00b70-84\u00b74) in the observation group (HR 0\u00b769 [95% CI 0\u00b752-0\u00b793]; p=0\u00b7014), and in transplantation-ineligible patients it was 66\u00b78% (61\u00b76-72\u00b71) in the lenalidomide group and 69\u00b78% (64\u00b74-75\u00b72) in the observation group (1\u00b702 [0\u00b780-1\u00b729]; p=0\u00b788). By cytogenetic risk group, in standard-risk patients, 3-year overall survival was 86\u00b74% (95% CI 80\u00b70-90\u00b79) in the lenalidomide group compared with 81\u00b73% (74\u00b72-86\u00b77) in the observation group, and in high-risk patients, it was 74.9% (65\u00b78-81\u00b79) in the lenalidomide group compared with 63\u00b77% (52\u00b78-72\u00b77) in the observation group; and in ultra-high-risk patients it was 62\u00b79% (46\u00b70-75\u00b78) compared with 43\u00b75% (22\u00b72-63\u00b71). Since these subgroup analyses results were not powered they should be interpreted with caution. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events for patients taking lenalidomide were haematological, including neutropenia (362 [33%] patients), thrombocytopenia (72 [7%] patients), and anaemia (42 [4%] patients). Serious adverse events were reported in 494 (45%) of 1097 patients receiving lenalidomide compared with 150 (17%) of 874 patients on observation. The most common serious adverse events were infections in both the lenalidomide group and the observation group. 460 deaths occurred during maintenance treatment, 234 (21%) in the lenalidomide group and 226 (27%) in the observation group, and no deaths in the lenalidomide group were deemed treatment related. INTERPRETATION:Maintenance therapy with lenalidomide significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma compared with observation, but did not improve overall survival in the intention-to-treat analysis of the whole trial population. The manageable safety profile of this drug and the encouraging results in subgroup analyses of patients across all cytogenetic risk groups support further investigation of maintenance lenalidomide in this setting.

A beneficial effect of lenalidomide maintenance therapy on overall survival in this setting has been inconsistent between individual studies. Minimal data are available on the effect of maintenance lenalidomide in more aggressive disease states, such as patients with cytogenetic high-risk disease or patients ineligible for transplantation. We aimed to assess lenalidomide maintenance versus observation in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, including cytogenetic risk and transplantation status subgroup analyses. METHODS:The Myeloma XI trial was an open-label, randomised, phase 3, adaptive design trial with three randomisation stages done at 110 National Health Service hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland. There were three potential randomisations in the study: induction treatment (allocation by transplantation eligibility status); intensification treatment (allocation by response to induction therapy); and maintenance treatment. Here, we report the results of the randomisation to maintenance treatment. Eligible patients for maintenance randomisation were aged 18 years or older and had symptomatic or non-secretory multiple myeloma, had completed their assigned induction therapy as per protocol and had achieved at least a minimal response to protocol treatment, including lenalidomide. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1 from Jan 13, 2011, to Jun 27, 2013, and 2:1 from Jun 28, 2013, to Aug 11, 2017) to lenalidomide maintenance (10 mg orally on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle) or observation, and stratified by allocated induction and intensification treatment, and centre.

Previous trials have reported improved visual acuity (VA), but lacked detailed analysis of retinal structure and function in the treated area.<h4>Design</h4>Phase 1/2 open-label dose-escalation trial to evaluate safety and potential efficacy (clinicaltrials.gov identifier, NCT01469832).<h4>Participants</h4>Twelve participants with advanced Stargardt disease (STGD1), the most common cause of macular degeneration in children and young adults.<h4>Methods</h4>Subretinal transplantation of up to 200\u2009000 hESC-derived RPE cells with systemic immunosuppressive therapy for 13 weeks.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>The primary end points were the safety and tolerability of hESC-derived RPE cell administration. We also investigated evidence of the survival of transplanted cells and measured retinal structure and function using microperimetry and spectral-domain OCT.<h4>Results</h4>Focal areas of subretinal hyperpigmentation developed in all participants in a dose-dependent manner in the recipient retina and persisted after withdrawal of systemic immunosuppression. We found no evidence of uncontrolled proliferation or inflammatory responses. Borderline improvements in best-corrected VA in 4 participants either were unsustained or were matched by a similar improvement in the untreated contralateral eye.

Previous trials have reported improved visual acuity (VA), but lacked detailed analysis of retinal structure and function in the treated area.<h4>Design</h4>Phase 1/2 open-label dose-escalation trial to evaluate safety and potential efficacy (clinicaltrials.gov identifier, NCT01469832).<h4>Participants</h4>Twelve participants with advanced Stargardt disease (STGD1), the most common cause of macular degeneration in children and young adults.<h4>Methods</h4>Subretinal transplantation of up to 200\u2009000 hESC-derived RPE cells with systemic immunosuppressive therapy for 13 weeks.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>The primary end points were the safety and tolerability of hESC-derived RPE cell administration. We also investigated evidence of the survival of transplanted cells and measured retinal structure and function using microperimetry and spectral-domain OCT.<h4>Results</h4>Focal areas of subretinal hyperpigmentation developed in all participants in a dose-dependent manner in the recipient retina and persisted after withdrawal of systemic immunosuppression. We found no evidence of uncontrolled proliferation or inflammatory responses. Borderline improvements in best-corrected VA in 4 participants either were unsustained or were matched by a similar improvement in the untreated contralateral eye. Microperimetry demonstrated no evidence of benefit at 12 months in the 12 participants. In one instance at the highest dose, localized retinal thinning and reduced sensitivity in the area of hyperpigmentation suggested the potential for harm.

Leucostim\u00ae is a recombinant filgrastim product tested for biosimilarity with its reference product, Neupogen\u00ae. We conducted a comparative clinical trial of the 2 products. Patients and methods:A randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover, single-dose Phase I study was conducted for 56 healthy subjects. After a 5 and 10 \u03bcg/kg single subcutaneous administration of test and reference product, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters (absolute neutrophil count and CD34+ cell count) were compared. During the study, safety tests and adverse event monitoring were performed. Results:The test and the reference products had a comparable pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety profile.

We hypothesised that dual B-cell receptor pathway blockade would be tolerable and efficacious. We investigated a next-generation phosphoinositide-3-kinase-\u03b4 inhibitor (PI3K-\u03b4i), umbralisib, plus a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi), ibrutinib, in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and mantle cell lymphoma.<h4>Methods</h4>We did an investigator-initiated, multicentre, phase 1-1b study of patients from five sites in the USA (academic and community sites). Patients were 18 years and older with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or mantle cell lymphoma, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less, and were given umbralisib orally once daily (400 mg, 600 mg, or 800 mg) and ibrutinib orally once daily (420 mg for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or 560 mg for mantle cell lymphoma) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The phase 1 dose-escalation cohorts for each histology escalated independently in a standard 3\u2008\u00d7\u20083 design. The primary endpoints were intention-to-treat assessment of maximum-tolerated dose, safety, and dose-limiting toxicities. This trial is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02268851.<h4>Findings</h4>Between Dec 5, 2014, and March 7, 2018, we enrolled 44 patients, of which 42 were given at least one dose of study drug (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, n=21; mantle cell lymphoma, n=21). Patients had a median age of 68 years (range 48-85) and had a median of two (IQR 1-3) previous therapies. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed and the maximum-tolerated dose of umbralisib was not reached. The recommended phase 2 dose of umbralisib when given in combination with ibrutinib was 800 mg once daily. The most frequent adverse events included diarrhoea (22 [52%] patients, 10% of whom had grade 3), infection (21 [50%], 17% grade 3-4), and transaminitis (ten [24%], 2% grade 3).

We hypothesised that dual B-cell receptor pathway blockade would be tolerable and efficacious. We investigated a next-generation phosphoinositide-3-kinase-\u03b4 inhibitor (PI3K-\u03b4i), umbralisib, plus a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi), ibrutinib, in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and mantle cell lymphoma.<h4>Methods</h4>We did an investigator-initiated, multicentre, phase 1-1b study of patients from five sites in the USA (academic and community sites). Patients were 18 years and older with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or mantle cell lymphoma, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less, and were given umbralisib orally once daily (400 mg, 600 mg, or 800 mg) and ibrutinib orally once daily (420 mg for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or 560 mg for mantle cell lymphoma) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The phase 1 dose-escalation cohorts for each histology escalated independently in a standard 3\u2008\u00d7\u20083 design. The primary endpoints were intention-to-treat assessment of maximum-tolerated dose, safety, and dose-limiting toxicities. This trial is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02268851.<h4>Findings</h4>Between Dec 5, 2014, and March 7, 2018, we enrolled 44 patients, of which 42 were given at least one dose of study drug (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, n=21; mantle cell lymphoma, n=21). Patients had a median age of 68 years (range 48-85) and had a median of two (IQR 1-3) previous therapies. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed and the maximum-tolerated dose of umbralisib was not reached. The recommended phase 2 dose of umbralisib when given in combination with ibrutinib was 800 mg once daily. The most frequent adverse events included diarrhoea (22 [52%] patients, 10% of whom had grade 3), infection (21 [50%], 17% grade 3-4), and transaminitis (ten [24%], 2% grade 3). Serious adverse events occurred in 12 (29%) patients and included lipase elevation, atrial fibrillation, hypophosphataemia, adrenal insufficiency, transaminitis, and infections.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Umbralisib plus ibrutinib is well tolerated and active in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and mantle cell lymphoma, with a recommended phase 2 dose of umbralisib 800 mg once daily. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first clinical data on a BTKi and PI3K-\u03b4i doublet in B-cell malignancies, and the results suggest that this approach is feasible and worthy of further study.<h4>Funding</h4>TG Therapeutics, Leukemia and Lymphoma Society Therapy Accelerator Program.", "journaltitle": "The Lancet.

Fifty-six patients will be randomized to receive either SRS of all brain metastases (up to ten lesions) or WBRT.

(MS) is a progressively debilitating neurological condition in which the immune system abnormally erodes the myelin sheath insulating the nerves. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been used in the last decade to safely treat certain immune and inflammatory conditions.<h4>Methods</h4>A safety and feasibility study was completed on the use of umbilical cord MSC (UCMSC) as a treatment for MS. In this 1-year study, consenting subjects received seven intravenous infusions of 20\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>6</sup> UCMSC over 7\u00a0days. Efficacy was assessed at baseline, 1\u00a0month and 1\u00a0year after treatment, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Scripps Neurological Rating Scale, Nine-Hole Peg Test, 25-Foot Walk Test, and RAND Short Form-36 quality of life questionnaire.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty subjects were enrolled in this study. No serious adverse events were reported. Of the mild AEs denoted as possibly related to treatment, most were headache or fatigue. Symptom improvements were most notable 1\u00a0month after treatment. Improvements were seen in EDSS scores (p\u2009<\u20090.03), as well as in bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction (p\u2009<\u20090.01), in non-dominant hand average scores (p\u2009<\u20090.01), in walk times (p\u2009<\u20090.02) and general perspective of a positive health change and improved quality of life.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been used in the last decade to safely treat certain immune and inflammatory conditions.<h4>Methods</h4>A safety and feasibility study was completed on the use of umbilical cord MSC (UCMSC) as a treatment for MS. In this 1-year study, consenting subjects received seven intravenous infusions of 20\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>6</sup> UCMSC over 7\u00a0days. Efficacy was assessed at baseline, 1\u00a0month and 1\u00a0year after treatment, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Scripps Neurological Rating Scale, Nine-Hole Peg Test, 25-Foot Walk Test, and RAND Short Form-36 quality of life questionnaire.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty subjects were enrolled in this study. No serious adverse events were reported. Of the mild AEs denoted as possibly related to treatment, most were headache or fatigue. Symptom improvements were most notable 1\u00a0month after treatment. Improvements were seen in EDSS scores (p\u2009<\u20090.03), as well as in bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction (p\u2009<\u20090.01), in non-dominant hand average scores (p\u2009<\u20090.01), in walk times (p\u2009<\u20090.02) and general perspective of a positive health change and improved quality of life. MRI scans of the brain and the cervical spinal cord showed inactive lesions in 15/18 (83.3%) subjects after 1\u00a0year.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Treatment with UCMSC intravenous infusions for subjects with MS is safe, and potential therapeutic benefits should be further investigated.

BMCA is universally detected on patient-derived myeloma cells and has emerged as a selective antigen to be targeted by novel treatments in multiple myeloma. We assessed the safety, tolerability, and preliminary clinical activity of GSK2857916, a novel anti-BCMA antibody conjugated to microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin F, in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.<h4>Methods</h4>We did an international, multicentre, open-label, first-in-human phase 1 study with dose escalation (part 1) and dose expansion (part 2) phases, at nine centres in the USA, Canada, and the UK. Adults with histologically or cytologically confirmed multiple myeloma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, and progressive disease after stem cell transplantation, alkylators, proteasome inhibitors, and immunomodulators were recruited for this study. In part 1, patients received GSK2857916 (0\u00b703-4\u00b760 mg/kg) through 1 h intravenous infusions once every 3 weeks. In part 2, patients received the selected recommended phase 2 dose of GSK2857916 (3\u00b740 mg/kg) once every 3 weeks. Primary endpoints were maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose. Secondary endpoints for part 2 included preliminary anti-cancer clinical activity. All patients who received one or more doses were included in this prespecified administrative interim analysis (data cutoff date June 26, 2017), which was done for internal purposes. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02064387, and is ongoing, but closed for recruitment.<h4>Findings</h4>Between July 29, 2014, and Feb 21, 2017, we treated 73 patients: 38 patients in the dose-escalation part 1 and 35 patients in the dose-expansion part 2. There were no dose-limiting toxicities and no maximum tolerated dose was identified in part 1. On the basis of safety and clinical activity, we selected 3\u00b740 mg/kg as the recommended phase 2 dose. Corneal events were common (20 [53%] of 38 patients in part 1 and 22 [63%] of 35 in part 2); most (18 [47%] in part 1 and 19 [54%] in part 2) were grade 1 or 2 and resulted in two treatment discontinuations in part 1 and no discontinuations in part 2. The most common grade 3 or 4 events were thrombocytopenia (13 [34%] of 38 patients in part 1 and 12 [34%] of 35 in part 2) and anaemia (6 [16%] in part 1 and 5 [14%] in part 2). There were 12 treatment-related serious adverse events and no treatment-related deaths. In part 2, 21 (60\u00b70%; 95% CI 42\u00b71-76\u00b71) of 35 patients achieved an overall response.<h4>Interpretation</h4>At the identified recommended phase 2 dose, GSK2857916 was well tolerated and had good clinical activity in heavily pretreated patients, thereby indicating that this might be a promising candidate for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.<h4>Funding</h4>GlaxoSmithKline.", "affiliation": "Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.

At 6 months, we found a significant improvement in RV function in the SC Group (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion [TAPSE]: +0.44\u2009\u00b1\u20090.64 cm, p\u2009=\u2009.001; peak systolic tissue Doppler velocity of tricuspid annulus [St]: +1.5\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1 cm/s; p\u2009=\u2009.001; percent of fractional area change [FAC]: +8.6%\u2009\u00b1\u20095%, p\u2009=\u2009.01), but not in Controls (TAPSE: -0.07\u2009\u00b1\u20090.32 cm, p\u2009=\u2009.40; St: -0.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2 cm/s; p\u2009=\u2009.44; FAC: -1.2%\u2009\u00b1\u20093.2%, p\u2009=\u2009.50). On repeat electroanatomical mapping, we found an improvement in interventricular septum viability in 19 of 30 patients from the SC Group; this correlated with the improvements in RV function (13/19 in the improved septum group versus 3/11 in the remaining cohort, p\u2009=\u2009.029). These results suggest that patients with DCM, changes in RV function correlate with changes of viability of interventricular septum. CD34<sup>+</sup> cell therapy appears to be associated with improved right ventricular function in this patient cohort. (Clinical Trial Registration Information: www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT02248532).

Quizartinib is an oral, highly potent, and selective next-generation FLT3 inhibitor with clinical antileukaemic activity in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of single-agent quizartinib in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia.<h4>Methods</h4>We did an open-label, multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 trial at 76 hospitals and cancer centres in the USA, Europe, and Canada. We enrolled patients with morphologically documented primary acute myeloid leukaemia or acute myeloid leukaemia secondary to myelodysplastic syndromes and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2 into two predefined, independent cohorts: patients who were aged 60 years or older with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia within 1 year after first-line therapy (cohort 1), and those who were 18 years or older with relapsed or refractory disease following salvage chemotherapy or haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (cohort 2). Patients with an FLT3-ITD allelic frequency of more than 10% were considered as FLT3-ITD positive, whereas all other patients were considered as FLT3-ITD negative. Patients received quizartinib once daily as an oral solution; the initial 17 patients received 200 mg per day but the QTcF interval was prolonged for more than 60 ms above baseline in some of these patients. Subsequently, doses were amended for all patients to 135 mg per day for men and 90 mg per day for women. The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved a composite complete remission (defined as complete remission\u2008+\u2008complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery\u2008+\u2008complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery) and the proportion of patients who achieved a complete remission. Efficacy and safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of quizartinib (ie, the intention-to-treat population). Patients with a locally assessed post-treatment bone marrow aspirate or biopsy were included in efficacy analyses by response; all other patients were considered to have an unknown response. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00989261, and with the European Clinical Trials Database, EudraCT 2009-013093-41, and is completed.<h4>Findings</h4>Between Nov 19, 2009, and Oct 31, 2011, a total of 333 patients were enrolled (157 in cohort 1 and 176 in cohort 2). In cohort 1, 63 (56%) of 112 FLT3-ITD-positive patients and 16 (36%) of 44 FLT3-ITD-negative patients achieved composite complete remission, with three (3%) FLT3-ITD-positive patients and two (5%) FLT3-ITD-negative patients achieving complete remission. In cohort 2, 62 (46%) of 136 FLT3-ITD-positive patients achieved composite complete remission with five (4%) achieving complete remission, whereas 12 (30%) of 40 FLT3-ITD-negative patients achieved composite complete remission with one (3%) achieving complete remission. Across both cohorts (ie, the intention-to-treat population of 333 patients), grade 3 or worse treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events in 5% or more of patients were febrile neutropenia (76 [23%] of 333), anaemia (75 [23%]), thrombocytopenia (39 [12%]), QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) prolongation (33 [10%]), neutropenia (31 [9%]), leucopenia (22 [7%]), decreased platelet count (20 [6%]), and pneumonia (17 [5%]). Serious adverse events occurring in 5% or more of patients were febrile neutropenia (126 [38%] of 333; 76 treatment related), acute myeloid leukaemia progression (73 [22%]), pneumonia (40 [12%]; 14 treatment related), QTcF prolongation (33 [10%]; 32 treatment related), sepsis (25 [8%]; eight treatment related), and pyrexia (18 [5%]; nine treatment related). Notable serious adverse events occurring in less than 5% of patients were torsades de pointes (one [<1%]) and hepatic failure (two [1%]). In total, 125 (38%) of 333 patients died within the study treatment period, including the 30-day follow-up. 18 (5%) patients died because of an adverse event considered by the investigator to be treatment related (ten [6%] of 157 patients in cohort 1 and eight [5%] of 176 in cohort 2.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Single-agent quizartinib was shown to be highly active and generally well tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia, particularly those with FLT3-ITD mutations. These findings confirm that targeting the FLT3-ITD driver mutation with a highly potent and selective FLT3 inhibitor is a promising clinical strategy to help improve clinical outcomes in patients with very few options. Phase 3 studies (NCT02039726; NCT02668653) will examine quizartinib at lower starting doses.<h4>Funding</h4>Ambit Biosciences/Daiichi Sankyo.", "affiliation": "Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.

progenitors has emerged as a promising therapeutic for refractory angina (RA) patients. In the present study, we evaluated the safety and preliminary efficacy of transcatheter delivery of autologous BM-derived advanced therapy medicinal product CD133<sup>+</sup> cells (ATMP-CD133) in RA patients, correlating perfusion outcome with cell function.<h4>Methods</h4>In the phase I \"Endocavitary Injection of Bone Marrow Derived CD133<sup>+</sup> Cells in Ischemic Refractory Cardiomyopathy\" (RECARDIO) trial, a total of 10 patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (ejection fraction \u2264\u200945%) and evidence of reversible ischemia, as assessed by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), underwent BM aspiration and fluoroscopy-based percutaneous endomyocardial delivery of ATMP-CD133. Patients were evaluated at 6 and 12\u00a0months for safety and preliminary efficacy endpoints. ATMP-CD133 samples were used for in vitro correlations.<h4>Results</h4>Patients were treated safely with a mean number of 6.57\u2009\u00b1\u20093.45\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u00a010<sup>6</sup> ATMP-CD133. At 6-month follow-up, myocardial perfusion at SPECT was significantly ameliorated in terms of changes in summed stress (from 18.2\u2009\u00b1\u20098.6 to 13.8\u2009\u00b1\u20097.8, p\u2009=\u20090.05) and difference scores (from 12.0\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3 to 6.1\u2009\u00b1\u20094.0, p\u2009=\u20090.02) and number of segments with inducible ischemia (from 7.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2 to 4.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092.7, p\u2009=\u20090.003). Similarly, Canadian Cardiovascular Society and New York Heart Association classes significantly improved at follow-up vs baseline (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001 and p\u2009=\u20090.007, respectively). Changes in summed stress score changes positively correlated with ATMP-CD133 release of proangiogenic cytokines HGF and PDGF-bb (r\u2009=\u20090.80, p\u2009=\u20090.009 and r\u2009=\u20090.77, p\u2009=\u20090.01, respectively) and negatively with the proinflammatory cytokines RANTES (r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.79, p\u2009=\u20090.01) and IL-6 (r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.76, p\u2009=\u20090.02).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Results of the RECARDIO trial suggested safety and efficacy in terms of clinical and perfusion outcomes in patients with RA and LV dysfunction. The observed link between myocardial perfusion improvements and ATMP-CD133 secretome may represent a proof of concept for further mechanistic investigations.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02059681 .

At 6-month follow-up, myocardial perfusion at SPECT was significantly ameliorated in terms of changes in summed stress (from 18.2\u2009\u00b1\u20098.6 to 13.8\u2009\u00b1\u20097.8, p\u2009=\u20090.05) and difference scores (from 12.0\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3 to 6.1\u2009\u00b1\u20094.0, p\u2009=\u20090.02) and number of segments with inducible ischemia (from 7.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2 to 4.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092.7, p\u2009=\u20090.003). Similarly, Canadian Cardiovascular Society and New York Heart Association classes significantly improved at follow-up vs baseline (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001 and p\u2009=\u20090.007, respectively). Changes in summed stress score changes positively correlated with ATMP-CD133 release of proangiogenic cytokines HGF and PDGF-bb (r\u2009=\u20090.80, p\u2009=\u20090.009 and r\u2009=\u20090.77, p\u2009=\u20090.01, respectively) and negatively with the proinflammatory cytokines RANTES (r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.79, p\u2009=\u20090.01) and IL-6 (r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.76, p\u2009=\u20090.02).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Results of the RECARDIO trial suggested safety and efficacy in terms of clinical and perfusion outcomes in patients with RA and LV dysfunction. The observed link between myocardial perfusion improvements and ATMP-CD133 secretome may represent a proof of concept for further mechanistic investigations.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02059681 .

"We present results of a prospective, multicenter, phase II study evaluating rituximab, bendamustine, bortezomib and dexamethasone as first-line treatment for patients with mantle cell lymphoma aged 65 years or older. A total of 74 patients were enrolled (median age, 73 years). Patients received a maximum of six cycles of treatment at 28-day intervals. The primary objective was to achieve an 18-month progression-free survival rate of 65% or higher. Secondary objectives were to evaluate toxicity and the prognostic impact of mantle cell lymphoma prognostic index, Ki67 expression, [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography and molecular minimal residual disease, in peripheral blood or bone marrow. With a median follow-up of 52 months, the 24-month progression-free survival rate was 70%, hence the primary objective was reached. After six cycles of treatment, 91% (54/59) of responding patients were analyzed for peripheral blood residual disease and 87% of these (47/54) were negative. Four-year overall survival rates of the patients who did not have or had detectable molecular residual disease in the blood at completion of treatment were 86.6% and 28.6%, respectively (<i>P</i><0.0001). Neither the mantle cell lymphoma index, nor fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography nor Ki67 positivity (cut off of \u226530%) showed a prognostic impact for survival. Hematologic grade 3-4 toxicities were mainly neutropenia (51%), thrombocytopenia (35%) and lymphopenia (65%).

A total of 74 patients were enrolled (median age, 73 years). Patients received a maximum of six cycles of treatment at 28-day intervals. The primary objective was to achieve an 18-month progression-free survival rate of 65% or higher. Secondary objectives were to evaluate toxicity and the prognostic impact of mantle cell lymphoma prognostic index, Ki67 expression, [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography and molecular minimal residual disease, in peripheral blood or bone marrow. With a median follow-up of 52 months, the 24-month progression-free survival rate was 70%, hence the primary objective was reached. After six cycles of treatment, 91% (54/59) of responding patients were analyzed for peripheral blood residual disease and 87% of these (47/54) were negative. Four-year overall survival rates of the patients who did not have or had detectable molecular residual disease in the blood at completion of treatment were 86.6% and 28.6%, respectively (<i>P</i><0.0001). Neither the mantle cell lymphoma index, nor fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography nor Ki67 positivity (cut off of \u226530%) showed a prognostic impact for survival. Hematologic grade 3-4 toxicities were mainly neutropenia (51%), thrombocytopenia (35%) and lymphopenia (65%). Grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicities were mainly fatigue (18.5%), neuropathy (15%) and infections. In conclusion, the tested treatment regimen is active as frontline therapy in older patients with mantle cell lymphoma, with manageable toxicity.

Loss of endothelial barrier integrity, inflammation, and impaired cellular oxygen have been shown to be primary contributors to sepsis. To date, little is known regarding the pathway for the mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from the bone marrow in sepsis whereas stromal-cell-derived factor 1a (SDF-1a) and hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) seem to have a role in the EPC response to hypoxic microenvironments. The aims of the study are: (a) to determine the time course of the levels of circulating EPCs (CD133/CD34), SDF-1a, and HIF-1 in septic patients undergoing major abdominal surgery (group S), (b) to investigate the relationship between CD133/CD34, HIF-1, and SDF-1a, and (c) to investigate the relationship of these factors with the outcome of group S patients treated with standard conventional therapy alone (CT) or with the addition of extracorporeal hemoperfusion therapy (HCT). METHODS/DESIGN:Patients undergoing major abdominal surgery will be allocated into groups: postoperative non-septic patients in an emergency surgical ward (group C) and postoperative septic patients in an intensive care unit (group S). The latter will be randomized to receive CT alone (S1) or with HCT (S2). Healthy volunteers (group H) will be recruited at University Hospital Foggia. Peripheral blood (PB) samples will be collected preoperatively (T0), at 24 h (T1), 72 h (T2), 7 (T3), and 10 (T4) postoperative days in groups S and C, and at T0 in group H. The CD34/133 cells and HIF-1 counts will be determined by flow cytometer analysis. The concentration of SDF-1a in plasma will be calculated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis (ELISA). DISCUSSION:This prospective randomized clinical trial is designed to investigate circulating stem cells, levels of HIF-1 and SDF-1a, and their interrelationship in septic postoperative abdominal surgical patients treated with CT alone or with HCT. The rationale is that an integrated understanding of the role of hypoxia-related factors and EPCs in PB of septic patients could indicate which molecular processes need to be regulated to recover the innate immunity homeostasis. Understanding the function of EPCs in sepsis may provide innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to improve the prognosis of this syndrome.

We randomly assigned patients (1:1) stratified by subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma and international prognostic index to either CHOP (intravenous cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, doxorubicin 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, and vincristine 1\u00b74 mg/m<sup>2</sup> [maximum 2 mg] on day 1, and oral prednisolone 100 mg on days 1-5) every 21 days for six cycles; or GEM-P (intravenous gemcitabine 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1, 8, and 15, cisplatin 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 15, and oral or intravenous methylprednisolone 1000 mg on days 1-5) every 28 days for four cycles. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a CT-based complete response or unconfirmed complete response on completion of study chemotherapy, to detect a 20% superiority of GEM-P compared with CHOP, assessed in all patients who received at least one cycle of treatment and had an end-of-treatment CT scan or reported clinical progression as the reason for stopping trial treatment. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study medication. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01719835) and the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT 2011-004146-18).<h4>Findings</h4>Between June 18, 2012, and Nov 16, 2016, we randomly assigned 87 patients to treatment, 43 to CHOP and 44 to GEM-P. A planned unmasked review of efficacy data by the independent data monitoring committee in November, 2016, showed that the number of patients with a confirmed or unconfirmed complete response with GEM-P was non-significantly inferior compared with CHOP and the trial was closed early. At a median follow-up of 27\u00b74 months (IQR 16\u00b76-38\u00b74), 23 patients (62%) of 37 assessable patients assigned to CHOP had achieved a complete response or unconfirmed complete response compared with 17 (46%) of 37 assigned to GEM-P (odds ratio 0\u00b752, 95% CI 0\u00b721-1\u00b731; p=0\u00b7164). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or worse in both groups were neutropenia (17 [40%] with CHOP and nine [20%] with GEM-P), thrombocytopenia (4 [10%] with CHOP and 13 [30%] with GEM-P, and febrile neutropenia (12 [29%] with CHOP and 3 [7%] with GEM-P). Two patients (5%) died during the study, both in the GEM-P group, from lung infections.<h4>Interpretation</h4>The number of patients with a complete response or unconfirmed complete response did not differ between the groups, indicating that GEM-P was not superior for this outcome. CHOP should therefore remain the reference regimen for previously untreated peripheral T-cell lymphoma.<h4>Funding</h4>Bloodwise and the UK National Institute of Health Research.", "affiliation": "The

A previous phase I/II trial demonstrated that CCR5 blockade with maraviroc in the first 30days after allo-HCT resulted in a low incidence of early acute GVHD, primarily in visceral organs, but with no impact on late acute or chronic GVHD. We conducted a phase II trial to examine the efficacy of an extended course of maraviroc, administered through post-transplantation day +90 in addition to standard prophylaxis in 37 recipients of reduced-intensity-conditioned unrelated donor allo-HCT performed to treat hematologic malignancies. Extended maraviroc treatment was safe and feasible. The primary study endpoint, day +180 rate of grade II-IV acute GVHD, was 22 \u00b1 7%, liver GVHD was not observed, and gut GVHD was uncommon. The day +180 rate of grade III-IV acute GVHD was 5 \u00b1 4%. The 1-year rate of moderate to severe chronic GVHD was 8 \u00b1 5% and that of disease relapse was 30 \u00b1 8%. Overall survival at 1 year was 70 \u00b1 8%. Compared with the previously studied short course of maraviroc, the extended course resulted in a significantly higher GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], .45; 95% confidence interval [CI], .25 to .82; P\u202f=\u202f.009) and overall survival (adjusted HR, .48; 95% CI, .24 to .96; P\u202f=\u202f.037). A combined analysis of both trials showed that high maraviroc trough concentrations on the day of hematopoietic cell infusion were associated with lower rates of acute GVHD.

The day +180 rate of grade III-IV acute GVHD was 5 \u00b1 4%. The 1-year rate of moderate to severe chronic GVHD was 8 \u00b1 5% and that of disease relapse was 30 \u00b1 8%. Overall survival at 1 year was 70 \u00b1 8%. Compared with the previously studied short course of maraviroc, the extended course resulted in a significantly higher GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], .45; 95% confidence interval [CI], .25 to .82; P\u202f=\u202f.009) and overall survival (adjusted HR, .48; 95% CI, .24 to .96; P\u202f=\u202f.037). A combined analysis of both trials showed that high maraviroc trough concentrations on the day of hematopoietic cell infusion were associated with lower rates of acute GVHD. An extended course of maraviroc after reduced-intensity-conditioned unrelated donor allo-HCT is safe and effective in preventing acute and chronic GVHD and is associated with favorable survival.", "Keywords": ["Graft-versus-host disease", "C-c Chemokine Receptor Type 5"], "journaltitle": "Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation", "authorinfo": ["Reshef R", "Ganetsky A", "Acosta EP", "Blauser R", "Crisalli L", "McGraw J", "Frey NV", "Hexner EO", "Hoxie JA", "Loren AW", "Luger SM", "Mangan J", "Stadtmauer EA", "Mick R", "Vonderheide RH", "Porter DL"], "title": "Extended CCR5 Blockade for Graft-versus-Host Disease Prophylaxis Improves Outcomes of Reduced-Intensity Unrelated Donor Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation: A Phase II Clinical Trial."}, "PMC6411304": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "30553167", "source": "MED", "pmid": "30553167", "pmcid": "PMC6411304", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC6411304"}, "doi": "10.1016/j.msard.2018.11.032", "title": "Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers link toxic astrogliosis and microglial activation to multiple sclerosis severity.", "authorString": "Masvekar R, Wu T, Kosa P, Barbour C, Fossati V, Bielekova B.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Masvekar R", "firstName": "Ruturaj", "lastName": "Masvekar", "initials": "R", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Neuroimmunological Diseases Section (NDS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Building 10, Room 5N248, 10 Center Drive, MSC1444, Bethesda, MD 20892, United States."}}}, {"fullName": "Wu T", "firstName": "Tianxia", "lastName": "Wu", "initials": "T", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States."}}}, {"fullName": "Kosa P", "firstName": "Peter", "lastName": "Kosa", "initials": "P", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Neuroimmunological Diseases Section (NDS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Building 10, Room 5N248, 10 Center Drive, MSC1444, Bethesda, MD 20892, United States."}}}, {"fullName": "Barbour C", "firstName": "Christopher", "lastName": "Barbour", "initials": "C", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Neuroimmunological Diseases Section (NDS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Building 10, Room 5N248, 10 Center Drive, MSC1444, Bethesda, MD 20892, United States; Department of Mathematical Sciences, Montana State University, Bozeman, MT, United States."}}}, {"fullName": "Fossati V", "firstName": "Valentina", "lastName": "Fossati", "initials": "V", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-1825-9371"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "The New York Stem Cell Foundation Research Institute, New York, NY, United States."}}}, {"fullName": "Bielekova B", "firstName": "Bibiana", "lastName": "Bielekova", "initials": "B", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Neuroimmunological Diseases Section (NDS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Building 10, Room 5N248, 10 Center Drive, MSC1444, Bethesda, MD 20892, United States.

Although they provide temporary symptom relief, current treatments fail to control motor and non-motor alterations or to arrest disease progression. Aiming to explore safety and possible motor and neuropsychological benefits of a novel strategy to improve the PD condition, a case series study was designed for brain grafting of human neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to a group of eight patients with moderate PD. A NPC line, expressing Oct-4 and Sox-2, was manufactured and characterized. Using stereotactic surgery, NPC suspensions were bilaterally injected into patients' dorsal putamina. Cyclosporine A was given for 10 days prior to surgery and continued for 1 month thereafter. Neurological, neuropsychological, and brain imaging evaluations were performed pre-operatively, 1, 2, and 4 years post-surgery. Seven of eight patients have completed 4-year follow-up. The procedure proved to be safe, with no immune responses against the transplant, and no adverse effects. One year after cell grafting, all but one of the seven patients completing the study showed various degrees of motor improvement, and five of them showed better response to medication. PET imaging showed a trend toward enhanced midbrain dopaminergic activity. By their 4-year evaluation, improvements somewhat decreased but remained better than at baseline. Neuropsychological changes were minor, if at all. The intervention appears to be safe. At 4 years post-transplantation we report that undifferentiated NPCs can be delivered safely by stereotaxis to both putamina of patients with PD without causing adverse effects. In 6/7 patients in OFF condition improvement in UPDRS III was observed. PET functional scans suggest enhanced putaminal dopaminergic neurotransmission that could correlate with improved motor function, and better response to L-DOPA. Patients' neuropsychological scores were unaffected by grafting.

lower limbs in patients with diabetes. The appearance, often as insidious as its resolution, is characterized by tense blisters on the skin surfaces of the lower limbs and the feet. The cause still remains unclear, but it may relate to microangiopathy and neuropathy. In this report, we present a case of a 64-year-old male with multiple episodes of blistering in the left lateral lower limb after a traumatic fall who was subsequently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient had a history of poorly controlled blood glucose and subsequently developed vasculopathy and peripheral neuropathy. Despite appropriate glycemic control and antibiotics therapy, the patient developed recurrent bullosis diabeticorum on five separate occasions during a 2-year span from 2005 to 2007. Building on our success with ischemic diabetic foot, we used bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMMSC) transplantation therapy for bullosis diabeticorum. After a 9-month treatment, this patient developed another episode of cellulitis in the same lower limb which was successfully treated with antibacterial therapy. It is interesting that the patient reported no recurrence in the next 10-year follow-up span. This study demonstrates that bullosis diabeticorum could appear even before the onset of diabetes, and vascular insufficiency predisposes to the occurrence of bullosis diabeticorum. Our findings suggest that autologous BMMSC transplantation therapy may be an effective measure for recurrent bullosis diabeticorum; however, this will require further investigation to be conclusive.

Successful treatment-free remission was defined as no confirmed loss of deep molecular response. We recruited 96 Japanese patients, of whom 78 sustained a deep molecular response during the consolidation phase and were therefore eligible to discontinue nilotinib in the treatment-free remission phase; of these, 53 patients (67.9%; 95% confidence interval: 56.4-78.1%) remained free from molecular recurrence in the first 12 months. The estimated 3-year treatment-free survival was 62.8%. Nilotinib was readministered to all patients (n=29) who experienced a molecular recurrence during the treatment-free remission phase. After restarting treatment, rapid deep molecular response returned in 25 patients (86.2%), with 50% of patients achieving a deep molecular response within 3.5 months.

A comparison to 130 matched controls who only received tacrolimus and methotrexate demonstrated a lower cumulative incidence of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (17% versus 45%, P=0.003) and a significant increase in grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease-free survival at six months (69% versus 42%, P=0.001) with tocilizumab, tacrolimus and methotrexate, which was the primary endpoint of the study. Immune reconstitution was preserved in patients treated with tocilizumab, tacrolimus and methotrexate, as T-cell and B-cell subsets recovered to near normal levels by 6-12 months post-transplantation. We conclude that tocilizumab has promising activity in preventing acute graft-versus-host disease, particularly in the lower gastrointestinal tract, and warrants examination in a randomized setting.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5865423?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Haematologica", "authorinfo": ["Drobyski WR", "Szabo A", "Zhu F", "Keever-Taylor C", "Hebert KM", "Dunn R", "Yim S", "Johnson B", "D'Souza A", "Eapen M", "Fenske TS", "Hari P", "Hamadani M", "Horowitz MM", "Rizzo JD", "Saber W", "Shah N", "Shaw B", "Pasquini M"], "title": "Tocilizumab, tacrolimus and methotrexate for the prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease: low incidence of lower gastrointestinal tract disease."}, "PMC5961605": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "29764889", "source": "MED", "pmid": "29764889", "pmcid": "PMC5961605", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC5961605"}, "doi": "10.1136/bmjopen-2018-021600", "title": "Autologous Stem Cells in Achilles Tendinopathy (ASCAT): protocol for a phase IIA, single-centre, proof-of-concept study.", "authorString": "Goldberg AJ, Zaidi R, Brooking D, Kim L, Korda M, Masci L, Green R, O'Donnell P, Smith R.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Goldberg AJ", "firstName": "Andrew J", "lastName": "Goldberg", "initials": "AJ", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "UCL Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science (IOMS), Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital (RNOH), Stanmore, UK."}}}, {"fullName": "Zaidi R", "firstName": "Razi", "lastName": "Zaidi", "initials": "R", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Princess Royal University Hospital, Orpington, UK."}}}, {"fullName": "Brooking D", "firstName": "Deirdre", "lastName": "Brooking", "initials": "D", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "UCL Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science (IOMS), Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital (RNOH), Stanmore, UK."}}}, {"fullName": "Kim L", "firstName": "Louise", "lastName": "Kim", "initials": "L", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Joint Research and Enterprise Office, St George's, University of London, London, UK."}}}, {"fullName": "Korda M", "firstName": "Michelle", "lastName": "Korda", "initials": "M", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Queen Mary University of London, London, UK."}}}, {"fullName": "Masci L", "firstName": "Lorenzo", "lastName": "Masci", "initials": "L", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Institute of Sport Exercise and Health, London, UK."}}}, {"fullName": "Green R", "firstName": "Ruth", "lastName": "Green", "initials": "R", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "UCL Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science (IOMS), Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital (RNOH), Stanmore, UK."}}}, {"fullName": "O'Donnell P", "firstName": "Paul", "lastName": "O'Donnell", "initials": "P", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "UCL Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science (IOMS), Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital (RNOH), Stanmore, UK."}}}, {"fullName": "Smith R", "firstName": "Roger", "lastName": "Smith", "initials": "R", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Royal Veterinary College, Hatfield, UK."}}}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "5", "volume": "8", "journalIssueId": "2679815", "dateOfPublication": "2018 May", "monthOfPublication": "5", "yearOfPublication": "2018", "printPublicationDate": "2018-05-01", "journal": {"title": "BMJ open", "ISOAbbreviation": "BMJ Open", "medlineAbbreviation": "BMJ Open", "NLMid": "101552874", "ISSN": "2044-6055", "ESSN": "2044-6055"}}, "pubYear": "2018", "pageInfo": "e021600", "abstractText": "INTRODUCTION:Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is a cause of pain and disability affecting both athletes and sedentary individuals.

Dasatinib is approved for treatment of adults and children with CML-CP. A phase I study determined suitable dosing for children with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemias. Methods CA180-226/NCT00777036 is a phase II, open-label, nonrandomized prospective trial of patients < 18 years of age receiving dasatinib. There are three cohorts: (1) imatinib-resistant/intolerant CML-CP, (2) imatinib-resistant/intolerant CML in accelerated/blast phase or Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 17), and (3) newly diagnosed CML-CP treated with tablets or powder for oral suspension. Major cytogenetic response > 30% for imatinib-resistant/intolerant patients and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) > 55% for newly diagnosed patients were of clinical interest. Results Of 113 patients with CML-CP, 14 (48%) who were imatinib-resistant/intolerant and 61 (73%) who were newly diagnosed remained on treatment at time of analysis. Major cytogenetic response > 30% was reached by 3 months in the imatinib-resistant/intolerant group and CCyR > 55% was reached by 6 months in the newly diagnosed CML-CP group. CCyR and major molecular response by 12 months, respectively, were 76% and 41% in the imatinib-resistant/intolerant group and 92% and 52% in newly diagnosed CML-CP group. Progression-free survival by 48 months was 78% and 93% in the imatinib-resistant/intolerant and newly diagnosed CML-CP groups, respectively. No dasatinib-related pleural or pericardial effusion, pulmonary edema, or pulmonary arterial hypertension were reported. Bone growth and development events were reported in 4% of patients. Conclusion In the largest prospective trial to date in children with CML-CP, we demonstrate that dasatinib is a safe, effective treatment of pediatric CML-CP. Target responses to first- or second-line dasatinib were met early, and deep molecular responses were observed. Safety of dasatinib in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults; however, no cases of pleural or pericardial effusion or pulmonary arterial hypertension were reported.", "affiliation": "Lia Gore, University of Colorado School of Medicine/Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, CO; Pamela R.

Safety of dasatinib in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults; however, no cases of pleural or pericardial effusion or pulmonary arterial hypertension were reported.", "journaltitle": "Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology", "authorinfo": ["Gore L", "Kearns PR", "de Martino ML", "Lee", "De Souza CA", "Bertrand Y", "Hijiya N", "Stork LC", "Chung NG", "Cardos RC", "Saikia T", "Fagioli F", "Seo JJ", "Landman-Parker J", "Lancaster D", "Place AE", "Rabin KR", "Sacchi M", "Swanink R", "Zwaan CM"], "title": "Dasatinib in Pediatric Patients With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Chronic Phase: Results From a Phase II Trial."}, "PMC6436818": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "30522922", "source": "MED", "pmid": "30522922", "pmcid": "PMC6436818", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC6436818"}, "doi": "10.1016/s0140-6736(18)32984-2", "title": "Brentuximab vedotin with chemotherapy for CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma (ECHELON-2): a global, double-blind, randomised, phase 3 trial.", "authorString": "Horwitz S, O'Connor OA, Pro B, Illidge T, Fanale M, Advani R, Bartlett NL, Christensen JH, Morschhauser F, Domingo-Domenech E, Rossi G, Kim WS, Feldman T, Lennard A, Belada D, Ill\u00e9s \u00c1, Tobinai K, Tsukasaki K, Yeh SP, Shustov A, H\u00fcttmann A, Savage KJ, Yuen S, Iyer S, Zinzani PL, Hua Z, Little M, Rao S, Woolery J, Manley T, Tr\u00fcmper L, ECHELON-2 Study Group.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Horwitz S", "firstName": "Steven", "lastName": "Horwitz", "initials": "S", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.

"<h4>Background</h4>Based on the encouraging activity and manageable safety profile observed in a phase 1 study, the ECHELON-2 trial was initiated to compare the efficacy and safety of brentuximab vedotin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (A+CHP) versus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) for the treatment of CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphomas.<h4>Methods</h4>ECHELON-2 is a double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, placebo-controlled, active-comparator phase 3 study. Eligible adults from 132 sites in 17 countries with previously untreated CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphomas (targeting 75% with systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma) were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either A+CHP or CHOP for six or eight 21-day cycles. Randomisation was stratified by histological subtype according to local pathology assessment and by international prognostic index score. All patients received cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and doxorubicin 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1 of each cycle intravenously and prednisone 100 mg once daily on days 1 to 5 of each cycle orally, followed by either brentuximab vedotin 1\u00b78 mg/kg and a placebo form of vincristine intravenously (A+CHP group) or vincristine 1\u00b74 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and a placebo form of brentuximab vedotin intravenously (CHOP group) on day 1 of each cycle. The primary endpoint, progression-free survival according to blinded independent central review, was analysed by intent-to-treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01777152.<h4>Findings</h4>Between Jan 24, 2013, and Nov 7, 2016, 601 patients assessed for eligibility, of whom 452 patients were enrolled and 226 were randomly assigned to both the A+CHP group and the CHOP group. Median progression-free survival was 48\u00b72 months (95% CI 35\u00b72-not evaluable) in the A+CHP group and 20\u00b78 months (12\u00b77-47\u00b76) in the CHOP group (hazard ratio 0\u00b771 [95% CI 0\u00b754-0\u00b793], p=0\u00b70110). Adverse events, including incidence and severity of febrile neutropenia (41 [18%] patients in the A+CHP group and 33 [15%] in the CHOP group) and peripheral neuropathy (117 [52%] in the A+CHP group and 124 [55%] in the CHOP group), were similar between groups. Fatal adverse events occurred in seven (3%) patients in the A+CHP group and nine (4%) in the CHOP group.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Front-line treatment with A+CHP is superior to CHOP for patients with CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphomas as shown by a significant improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival with a manageable safety profile.<h4>Funding</h4>Seattle Genetics Inc, Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmacuetical Company Limited, and National Institutes of Health National Cancer Institute Cancer Center.", "affiliation": "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.

"<h4>Background</h4>Intrauterine adhesions (IUA) are the most common cause of uterine infertility and are caused by endometrium fibrotic regeneration following severe damage to the endometrium. Although current stem cell treatment options using different types of autologous stem cells have exhibited some beneficial outcomes in IUA patients, the reported drawbacks include variable therapeutic efficacies, invasiveness and treatment unavailability. Therefore, the development of new therapeutic stem cell treatments is critical to improving clinical outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>Twenty-six patients who suffered from infertility caused by recurrent IUA were enrolled in this prospective, non-controlled, phase I clinical trial with a 30-month follow-up. During the procedure, 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>7</sup> umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSCs), loaded onto a collagen scaffold, were transplanted into the uterine cavity following an adhesion separation procedure. Medical history, physical examination, endometrial thickness, intrauterine adhesion score and the biological molecules related to endometrial proliferation and differentiation were assessed both before and 3\u00a0months after cell therapy.<h4>Results</h4>No treatment-related serious adverse events were found. Three months after the operation, the average maximum endometrial thickness in patients increased, and the intrauterine adhesion score decreased compared to those before the treatment. A histological study showed the upregulation of ER\u03b1 (estrogen receptor \u03b1), vimentin, Ki67 and vWF (von Willebrand factor) expression levels and the downregulation of \u0394NP63 expression level, which indicates an improvement in endometrial proliferation, differentiation and neovascularization following treatment. DNA short tandem repeat (STR) analysis showed that the regenerated endometrium contained patient DNA only. By the end of the 30-month follow-up period, ten of the 26 patients had become pregnant, and eight of them had delivered live babies with no obvious birth defects and without placental complications, one patient in the third trimester of pregnancy, and one had a spontaneous abortion at 7 weeks.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Transplanting clinical-grade UC-MSCs loaded onto a degradable collagen scaffold into the uterine cavity of patients with recurrent IUA following adhesiolysis surgery is a safety and effective therapeutic method.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Clinicaltrials.gov .

Previous studies have demonstrated anti-tumour activities of famitinib against a wide variety of advanced-stage solid cancers. We aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of famitinib with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). We also evaluated the feasibility of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (D-CEUS) as a predictor of early tumour response to famitinib and to correlate functional parameters with clinical efficacy.<h4>Methods</h4>The trial was conducted in subjects with stage III or IVa-b NPC using a 3\u2009+\u20093 design of escalating famitinib doses. Briefly, subjects received 2\u00a0weeks of famitinib monotherapy followed by 7\u00a0weeks of famitinib plus CCRT. D-CEUS of the neck lymph nodes was performed at day 0, 8 and 15 after famitinib was administered before starting concurrent chemoradiotherapy. End points included safety, tolerability and anti-tumour activity.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty patients were enrolled (six each for 12.5, 16.5 and 20\u00a0mg and two for 25\u00a0mg). Two patients in the 25\u00a0mg cohort developed dose-limiting toxicities, including grade 4 thrombocytopenia and grade 3 hypertension. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were leukopenia, neutropenia and radiation mucositis. D-CEUS tests showed that more than 60% of patients achieved a perfusion parameter response after 2\u00a0weeks taking famitinib alone, and the parameter response was associated with disease improvement. In the famitinib monotherapy stage, three patients (15%) showed partial responses. The complete response rate was 65% at the completion of treatment and 95% 3\u00a0months after the treatment ended. After a median follow-up of 44\u00a0months, the 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and distant metastasis-free survival were 70% and 75%, respectively. Subjects with a decrease of perfusion parameter response, such as peak intensity decreased at least 30% after 1\u00a0week of famitinib treatment, had higher 3-year PFS (90.9% vs. 44.4%, 95% CI 73.7%-100% vs. 11.9%-76.9%, P\u2009<\u20090.001) than those with an increase or a reduction of less than 30%.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The recommended famitinib dose for phase II trial is 20\u00a0mg with CCRT for patients with local advanced NPC. D-CEUS is a reliable and early measure of efficacy for famitinib therapies. Further investigation is required to confirm the effects of famitinib plus chemoradiotherapy.", "affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Diagnosis and Therapy, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, 510060, P.

inhibitor to enter the clinic. Given the efficacy of bortezomib in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone, we studied the combination of ixazomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (ICd) in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) and patients with measurable disease, irrespective of transplant eligibility, were enrolled. The phase 1 was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of cyclophosphamide in the combination. Patients received ixazomib 4\u2009mg (days 1, 8, 15), dexamethasone 40\u2009mg (days 1, 8, 15, 22), and cyclophosphamide 300 or 400\u2009mg/m<sup>2</sup> days 1, 8, 15, 22; cycles were 28 days. We enrolled 51 patients, 10 in phase 1 and 41 patients in phase 2. The median age was 64.5 years (range: 41-88); 29% had high or intermediate risk FISH. The MTD was 400\u2009mg/m<sup>2</sup> of cyclophosphamide weekly.

Therapeutic options for patients with MM have changed in the last decade with the arrival of proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs. Despite these options, almost all patients will relapse post first-line autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). First relapse management (second-line treatment) has evolved in recent years with an expanding portfolio of novel agents, driving response rates influencing the durability of response. A second ASCT, as part of relapsed disease management (salvage ASCT), has been shown to prolong the progression-free survival and overall survival following a proteasome inhibitor-containing re-induction regimen, in the Cancer Research UK-funded National Cancer Research Institute Myeloma X (Intensive) study. It is now recommended that salvage ASCT be considered for suitable patients by the International Myeloma Working Group and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence NG35 guidance.<h4>Methods/design</h4>ACCoRd (Myeloma XII) is a UK-nationwide, individually randomised, multi-centre, multiple randomisation, open-label phase III trial with an initial single intervention registration phase aimed at relapsing MM patients who have received ASCT in first-line treatment. We will register 406 participants into the trial to allow 284 and 248 participants to be randomised at the first and second randomisations, respectively. All participants will receive re-induction therapy until maximal response (four to six cycles of ixazomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone). Participants who achieve at least stable disease will be randomised (1:1) to receive either ASCT<sub>Con</sub>, using high-dose melphalan, or ASCT<sub>Aug</sub>, using high-dose melphalan with ixazomib. All participants achieving or maintaining a minimal response or better, following salvage ASCT, will undergo a second randomisation (1:1) to consolidation and maintenance or observation. Participants randomised to consolidation and maintenance will receive consolidation with two cycles of ixazomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone, and maintenance with ixazomib until disease progression.<h4>Discussion</h4>The question of how best to maximise the durability of response to salvage ASCT warrants clinical investigation. Given the expanding scope of oral therapeutic agents, patient engagement with long-term maintenance strategies is a real opportunity. This study will provide evidence to better define post-relapse treatment in MM.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ISRCTN, ISRCTN10038996 .

"Preclinical models have shown that blocking PD-1/PD-L1 pathways enhances antileukemic responses. Azacitidine upregulates PD-1 and IFN\u03b3 signaling. We therefore conducted this single-arm trial, in which patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were treated with azacitidine 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> days 1 to 7 intravenously or subcutaneously with nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously on days 1 and 14, every 4 to 6 weeks. For the seventy patients who were treated, the median age was 70 years (range, 22-90) and the median number of prior therapies received was 2 (range, 1-7). The overall response rate (ORR) was 33%, including 15 (22%) complete remission/complete remission with insufficient recovery of counts, 1 partial response, and 7 patients with hematologic improvement maintained >6 months. Six patients (9%) had stable disease >6 months. The ORR was 58% and 22%, in hypomethylating agent (HMA)-na\u00efve (<i>n</i> = 25) and HMA-pretreated (<i>n</i> = 45) patients, respectively. Grade 3 to 4 immune-related adverse events occurred in 8 (11%) patients. Pretherapy bone marrow and peripheral blood CD3 and CD8 were significantly predictive for response on flow cytometry. CTLA4 was significantly upregulated on CD4<sup>+</sup> Teff in nonresponders after 2 and 4 doses of nivolumab. Azacitidine and nivolumab therapy produced an encouraging response rate and overall survival in patients with R/R AML, particularly in HMA-na\u00efve and salvage 1 patients. Pretherapy bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood CD3 percentage may be biomarkers for patient selection. SIGNIFICANCE: Azacitidine in combination with nivolumab appeared to be a safe and effective therapy in patients with AML who were salvage 1, prior hypomethylator-na\u00efve, or had increased pretherapy CD3<sup>+</sup> bone marrow infiltrate by flow cytometry or IHC. Bone marrow CD3 and CD8 are relatively simple assays that should be incorporated to select patients in future trials. <i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 305</i>.",

A Phase 2 study of high dose pravastatin given in combination with idarubicin and cytarabine demonstrated an impressive response rate [75% complete remission (CR), CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi)]. However, this population was a favorable risk group as eligible patients had to have a CR/CRi lasting \u22653 months following their most recent chemotherapy. Therefore, the study was amended to treat patients with poor risk disease including those with CR/CRi <6\u202fmonths following their last induction regimen or with refractory disease. Here, we present results in this poor risk group. This trial included a significant number of patients with poor risk cytogenetics (43%) and poor risk molecular mutations. The response rate was 30% and approximately one-fourth of patients were able to proceed to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The median overall survival for patients proceeding to allogeneic HSCT is 27.1 months.

acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts to chemotherapy. A Phase 2 study of high dose pravastatin given in combination with idarubicin and cytarabine demonstrated an impressive response rate [75% complete remission (CR), CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi)]. However, this population was a favorable risk group as eligible patients had to have a CR/CRi lasting \u22653 months following their most recent chemotherapy. Therefore, the study was amended to treat patients with poor risk disease including those with CR/CRi <6\u202fmonths following their last induction regimen or with refractory disease. Here, we present results in this poor risk group. This trial included a significant number of patients with poor risk cytogenetics (43%) and poor risk molecular mutations. The response rate was 30% and approximately one-fourth of patients were able to proceed to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The median overall survival for patients proceeding to allogeneic HSCT is 27.1 months. Although this trial did not meet criteria for a positive study based on the response rate (p\u202f=\u202f.062), these results are encouraging given the poor risk population and suggest that targeting the cholesterol pathway may have therapeutic benefit in AML.", "Keywords": ["Acute myeloid leukemia", "cytarabine", "pravastatin", "Refractory", "Relapsed", "Idarubicin"], "journaltitle": "Leukemia

We conducted a phase II study of OM in patients with MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) who had previously failed or been intolerant to HMAs.

Vorinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, has been shown to have neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects in preclinical models of neurologic diseases. Thus, within the context of a myeloablative conditioning phase II clinical trial of vorinostat combined with tacrolimus and methotrexate for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, we conducted an ancillary study to evaluate feasibility of assessing associations between vorinostat and neurocognitive function and quality of life (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02409134). Nine patients (mean age, 53 years; range, 36 to 66) underwent computerized neuropsychological testing (Cogstate) and completed surveys of mood (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7), and quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General). Control cohorts from a separate concurrent longitudinal study (19 autologous and 18 allogeneic HCT patients, who matched the vorinostat patients on relevant medical and demographic variables) completed the same test battery. All allogeneic patients received busulfan-based myeloablative conditioning and were transplanted with HLA-matched unrelated donors. The total neurocognitive performance score of vorinostat patients did not change significantly across the study duration (ie, baseline, day 30, day 100, and day 160). Depression, anxiety, and quality of life also did not differ significantly across time. In univariate analyses (analysis of variance), vorinostat-treated patients showed no difference in neurocognitive function or quality of life compared with autologous and allogeneic control subjects. However, when medical variables were accounted for in a linear mixed effects regression model, the total neurocognitive performance of vorinostat-treated patients was comparable with autologous control subjects. Notably, autologous control subjects performed significantly better than allogeneic control subjects (estimate, .64; standard error, .23; P \u2264 .01).

Vorinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, has been shown to have neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects in preclinical models of neurologic diseases. Thus, within the context of a myeloablative conditioning phase II clinical trial of vorinostat combined with tacrolimus and methotrexate for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, we conducted an ancillary study to evaluate feasibility of assessing associations between vorinostat and neurocognitive function and quality of life (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02409134). Nine patients (mean age, 53 years; range, 36 to 66) underwent computerized neuropsychological testing (Cogstate) and completed surveys of mood (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7), and quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General). Control cohorts from a separate concurrent longitudinal study (19 autologous and 18 allogeneic HCT patients, who matched the vorinostat patients on relevant medical and demographic variables) completed the same test battery. All allogeneic patients received busulfan-based myeloablative conditioning and were transplanted with HLA-matched unrelated donors. The total neurocognitive performance score of vorinostat patients did not change significantly across the study duration (ie, baseline, day 30, day 100, and day 160). Depression, anxiety, and quality of life also did not differ significantly across time. In univariate analyses (analysis of variance), vorinostat-treated patients showed no difference in neurocognitive function or quality of life compared with autologous and allogeneic control subjects. However, when medical variables were accounted for in a linear mixed effects regression model, the total neurocognitive performance of vorinostat-treated patients was comparable with autologous control subjects. Notably, autologous control subjects performed significantly better than allogeneic control subjects (estimate, .64; standard error, .23; P \u2264 .01). Moreover, a smaller percentage of vorinostat-treated patients were classified as mildly, moderately, or severely impaired across neurocognitive domains as well as time points compared with both control cohorts.

A non-transplanted group with similar clinical characteristics, aged 65-70\u00a0years old, diagnosed and treated in the same timeline was used for comparison.

Conditioning consisted of melphalan 200\u00a0mg/m<sup>2</sup> (MEL200) in younger patients and melphalan 140\u00a0mg/m<sup>2</sup> (MEL140) in half of elderly patients. Stratifying by age, there were no statistically significant differences concerning transplant-related myelotoxicity and non-hematopoietic toxicity; however, elderly patients conditioned with MEL200 had higher needs of transfusional support and more days of intravenous antibiotics. Those patients also had higher needs of transfusional support, higher grade of mucositis (p\u2009=\u20090.028), and more days of intravenous antibiotics (p\u2009=\u20090.019) than the elderly transplanted with MEL140. Global transplant-related mortality was 3.8%. Survival was not influenced by age. Non-transplanted elderly patients had comparable disease features, and induction response was similar in both groups (before ASCT in the transplanted cohort).

We performed a\u00a0retrospective analysis of newly diagnosed MM patients who underwent ASCT between January 2010 and July 2016. A non-transplanted group with similar clinical characteristics, aged 65-70\u00a0years old, diagnosed and treated in the same timeline was used for comparison. We analyzed a total of 155 patients, 132 of which underwent ASCT (\u2264\u200965\u00a0years, n\u2009=\u2009103, median 56\u00a0years; >\u200965\u00a0years, n\u2009=\u200929, median 67\u00a0years) and 23 non-transplanted (median 68\u00a0years). Conditioning consisted of melphalan 200\u00a0mg/m<sup>2</sup> (MEL200) in younger patients and melphalan 140\u00a0mg/m<sup>2</sup> (MEL140) in half of elderly patients. Stratifying by age, there were no statistically significant differences concerning transplant-related myelotoxicity and non-hematopoietic toxicity; however, elderly patients conditioned with MEL200 had higher needs of transfusional support and more days of intravenous antibiotics. Those patients also had higher needs of transfusional support, higher grade of mucositis (p\u2009=\u20090.028), and more days of intravenous antibiotics (p\u2009=\u20090.019) than the elderly transplanted with MEL140. Global transplant-related mortality was 3.8%. Survival was not influenced by age. Non-transplanted elderly patients had comparable disease features, and induction response was similar in both groups (before ASCT in the transplanted cohort). Survival of transplanted elderly patients was superior to non-transplanted (OS, 59\u00a0months vs 30\u00a0months, p\u2009=\u20090.037; EFS, 45\u00a0months vs 27\u00a0months, p\u2009=\u20090.014).

Although cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity have emerged as predominant noninfectious complications of CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, infections associated with this treatment modality have not been well documented. Methods:We analyzed infectious complications that followed CD19 CAR T-cell therapy in 53 adult patients with relapsed B-ALL enrolled in a phase I clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (NCT01044069). Results:Overall, 22 patients (42%) experienced 26 infections (17 bacterial, 4 fungal, and 5 viral) within the first 30 days of CAR T-cell infusion. In 10 of 32 (31%) patients in whom complete remission was achieved, 15 infections developed between days 31 and 180; the majority of these late infections were due to respiratory viruses. In general, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections were detected at a median of 18, 23, and 48 days, respectively, after CAR T-cell infusion. CRS grade 3 or higher was independently associated with increased risk of subsequent infection (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.67; P = .05) and in particular with bloodstream infection (adjusted HR, 19.97; P < .001).

Although cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity have emerged as predominant noninfectious complications of CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, infections associated with this treatment modality have not been well documented. Methods:We analyzed infectious complications that followed CD19 CAR T-cell therapy in 53 adult patients with relapsed B-ALL enrolled in a phase I clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (NCT01044069). Results:Overall, 22 patients (42%) experienced 26 infections (17 bacterial, 4 fungal, and 5 viral) within the first 30 days of CAR T-cell infusion. In 10 of 32 (31%) patients in whom complete remission was achieved, 15 infections developed between days 31 and 180; the majority of these late infections were due to respiratory viruses. In general, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections were detected at a median of 18, 23, and 48 days, respectively, after CAR T-cell infusion. CRS grade 3 or higher was independently associated with increased risk of subsequent infection (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.67; P = .05) and in particular with bloodstream infection (adjusted HR, 19.97; P < .001). Three of 53 patients (6%) died of an infection-related cause. Conclusions:Infections in adult patients with relapsed B-ALL are common after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. Understanding the infectious complications that are temporally coincident with CD19 CAR T-cell therapy is critical for developing effective prophylactic and other supportive care measures to improve clinical outcomes.

papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among HIV-infected young men who have sex with men. On average, participants appropriately perceived themselves to be at lower than neutral risk for HPV (mean subscale score 4.2/10), at higher than neutral risk for other sexually transmitted infections (7.0/10), and that safer sexual behaviors were still important (8.5/10).

nonproductive tubulin aggregate formation. We performed a phase 1 trial to determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated or recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D), and pharmacokinetics (PK) of eribulin in children with refractory or recurrent solid (excluding central nervous system) tumors. METHODS:Eribulin was administered intravenously on days 1 and 8 in 21-day cycles. Three dose levels (1.1, 1.4, and 1.8\u00a0mg/m2 /dose) were evaluated using the rolling six design with additional patients enrolled into a PK expansion cohort at the MTD. PK samples were obtained following the day 1, cycle 1 dose. RESULTS:Twenty-three patients, ages 3-17 (median 14) years were enrolled; 20 were evaluable for toxicity. DLTs occurred in 0/6 and 1/6 subjects at the 1.1 and 1.4\u00a0mg/m2 /dose, respectively. One subject at the 1.4\u00a0mg/m2 /dose had grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3 fatigue. At the 1.8\u00a0mg/m2 /dose, 2/5 subjects experienced dose-limiting (grade 4) neutropenia. Grade 3/4 non-DLTs included lymphopenia and hypokalemia, while low-grade toxicities included anorexia and nausea. No episodes of grade\u00a0>\u00a02 corrected QT interval prolongation or peripheral neuropathy were reported.

We performed a phase 1 trial to determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated or recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D), and pharmacokinetics (PK) of eribulin in children with refractory or recurrent solid (excluding central nervous system) tumors. METHODS:Eribulin was administered intravenously on days 1 and 8 in 21-day cycles. Three dose levels (1.1, 1.4, and 1.8\u00a0mg/m2 /dose) were evaluated using the rolling six design with additional patients enrolled into a PK expansion cohort at the MTD. PK samples were obtained following the day 1, cycle 1 dose. RESULTS:Twenty-three patients, ages 3-17 (median 14) years were enrolled; 20 were evaluable for toxicity. DLTs occurred in 0/6 and 1/6 subjects at the 1.1 and 1.4\u00a0mg/m2 /dose, respectively. One subject at the 1.4\u00a0mg/m2 /dose had grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3 fatigue. At the 1.8\u00a0mg/m2 /dose, 2/5 subjects experienced dose-limiting (grade 4) neutropenia. Grade 3/4 non-DLTs included lymphopenia and hypokalemia, while low-grade toxicities included anorexia and nausea. No episodes of grade\u00a0>\u00a02 corrected QT interval prolongation or peripheral neuropathy were reported. Eribulin pharmacokinetic parameters were highly variable; the median elimination half-life was 39.6 (range 24.2-96.4) hr. A partial response was observed in one patient (Ewing sarcoma).

It was discovered that near-infrared wavelengths (800-900\u00a0nm) and red (600\u00a0nm) light-emitting diodes (LED) are able to penetrate through the scalp and skull and have the potential to improve the subnormal cellular activity of compromised brain tissue. Different experimental and clinical studies were performed to test LED therapy for traumatic brain injury (TBI) with promising results. One of the proposals of this present study is to develop different approaches to maximize the positive effects of this therapy and improve the quality of life of TBI patients. METHODS/DESIGN:This is a double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial of patients with diffuse axonal injury (DAI) due to a severe TBI in an acute stage (less than 8\u00a0h). Thirty\u00a0two patients will be randomized to active coil helmet and inactive coil (sham) groups in a 1:1 ratio. The protocol includes 18 sessions of transcranial LED stimulation (627\u00a0nm, 70\u00a0mW/cm2, 10\u00a0J/cm2) at four points of the frontal and parietal regions for 30\u00a0s each, totaling 120\u00a0s, three times per week for 6\u00a0weeks, lasting 30\u00a0min. Patients will be evaluated with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) before stimulation and 1, 3, and 6\u00a0months after the first stimulation. The study hypotheses are as follows: (1) transcranial LED therapy (TCLT) will improve the cognitive function of DAI patients and (2) TCLT will promote beneficial hemodynamic changes in cerebral circulation. DISCUSSION:This study evaluates early and delayed effects of TCLT on the cognitive rehabilitation for DAI following severe acute TBI. There is a paucity of studies regarding the use of this therapy for cognitive improvement in TBI. There are some experimental studies and case series presenting interesting results for TBI cognitive improvement but no clinical trials. TRIAL REGISTRATION:ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03281759 .

It was discovered that near-infrared wavelengths (800-900\u00a0nm) and red (600\u00a0nm) light-emitting diodes (LED) are able to penetrate through the scalp and skull and have the potential to improve the subnormal cellular activity of compromised brain tissue. Different experimental and clinical studies were performed to test LED therapy for traumatic brain injury (TBI) with promising results. One of the proposals of this present study is to develop different approaches to maximize the positive effects of this therapy and improve the quality of life of TBI patients. METHODS/DESIGN:This is a double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial of patients with diffuse axonal injury (DAI) due to a severe TBI in an acute stage (less than 8\u00a0h). Thirty\u00a0two patients will be randomized to active coil helmet and inactive coil (sham) groups in a 1:1 ratio. The protocol includes 18 sessions of transcranial LED stimulation (627\u00a0nm, 70\u00a0mW/cm2, 10\u00a0J/cm2) at four points of the frontal and parietal regions for 30\u00a0s each, totaling 120\u00a0s, three times per week for 6\u00a0weeks, lasting 30\u00a0min. Patients will be evaluated with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) before stimulation and 1, 3, and 6\u00a0months after the first stimulation. The study hypotheses are as follows: (1) transcranial LED therapy (TCLT) will improve the cognitive function of DAI patients and (2) TCLT will promote beneficial hemodynamic changes in cerebral circulation. DISCUSSION:This study evaluates early and delayed effects of TCLT on the cognitive rehabilitation for DAI following severe acute TBI. There is a paucity of studies regarding the use of this therapy for cognitive improvement in TBI. There are some experimental studies and case series presenting interesting results for TBI cognitive improvement but no clinical trials. TRIAL REGISTRATION:ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03281759 .

received only by patients who did not achieve a complete remission, and a chemotherapy/low-dose radiation salvage regimen was received by those who had a protocol-defined, low-risk recurrence.<h4>Methods</h4>Patients younger than 21 years who had stage IA or IIA nonbulky disease were eligible. The treatment strategy was evaluated by determining the proportion that received minimal chemotherapy alone, the proportion that had a first or second remission without the receipt of high-dose chemotherapy/stem cell rescue or higher dose involved-field radiation therapy (>21 grays), and overall survival.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 278 patients were eligible. At 4 years, 49.0% had received minimal chemotherapy and no radiation, 88.8% were in remission without receiving high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue or >21 grays of involved-field radiation therapy, and the overall survival rate was 99.6%. Patients who had mixed cellularity histology had a 4-year event-free survival (EFS) rate of 95.2%, which was significantly better than the 75.8% EFS for those who had nodular sclerosis histology (P\u2009=\u2009.008). A red blood cell sedimentation rate \u226420\u2009mm/hour and a negative fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scan after 1 cycle of chemotherapy (PET1) were associated with a favorable EFS outcome. The study was closed early when the receipt of radiation therapy exceeded the predefined monitoring boundary.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This limited chemotherapy response-based approach was successful in patients who had a negative PET1 result, had MC histology, or had a low red blood cell sedimentation rate. In this treatment paradigm, evaluation of increased chemotherapy intensity or the integration of active new agents is indicated for patients who have nodular sclerosis histology with a high ESR or who have a positive PET1 result.

Dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy is a promising alternative treatment strategy. A novel allogeneic DC vaccine, DCP-001, was developed from an AML-derived cell line that uniquely combines the positive features of allogeneic DC vaccines and expression of multi-leukemia-associated antigens. Here, we present data from a phase I study conducted with DCP-001 in 12 advanced-stage elderly AML patients. Patients enrolled were in complete remission (CR1/CR2) (n\u2009=\u20095) or had smoldering disease (n\u2009=\u20097). All patients were at high risk of relapse and ineligible for post-remission intensification therapies. A standard 3\u2009+\u20093 dose escalation design with extension to six patients in the highest dose was performed. Patients received four biweekly intradermal DCP-001 injections at different dose levels (10, 25, and 50\u00a0million cells DCP-001) and were monitored for clinical and immunological responses. Primary objectives of the study (feasibility and safety) were achieved with 10/12 patients completing the vaccination program. Treatment was well tolerated. A clear-cut distinction between patients with and without detectable circulating leukemic blasts during the vaccination period was noted.

Dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy is a promising alternative treatment strategy. A novel allogeneic DC vaccine, DCP-001, was developed from an AML-derived cell line that uniquely combines the positive features of allogeneic DC vaccines and expression of multi-leukemia-associated antigens. Here, we present data from a phase I study conducted with DCP-001 in 12 advanced-stage elderly AML patients. Patients enrolled were in complete remission (CR1/CR2) (n\u2009=\u20095) or had smoldering disease (n\u2009=\u20097). All patients were at high risk of relapse and ineligible for post-remission intensification therapies. A standard 3\u2009+\u20093 dose escalation design with extension to six patients in the highest dose was performed. Patients received four biweekly intradermal DCP-001 injections at different dose levels (10, 25, and 50\u00a0million cells DCP-001) and were monitored for clinical and immunological responses. Primary objectives of the study (feasibility and safety) were achieved with 10/12 patients completing the vaccination program. Treatment was well tolerated. A clear-cut distinction between patients with and without detectable circulating leukemic blasts during the vaccination period was noted. Patients with no circulating blasts showed an unusually prolonged survival [median overall survival 36 months (range 7-63) from\u00a0the start\u00a0of vaccination] whereas patients with circulating blasts, died within 6\u00a0months. Long-term survival was correlated with maintained T cell levels and induction of multi-functional immune responses.

Use of haploidentical (mismatched) donors increases HSCT availability but is limited by severe graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and delayed immune reconstitution. Alloanergization of donor T cells is a simple approach to rebuild immunity while limiting GvHD after haploidentical HSCT, but the optimal T-cell dose and impact on immune reconstitution remain unknown.Patients and Methods: We performed a multicenter phase I trial of alloanergized donor lymphocyte infusion (aDLI) after CD34-selected myeloablative haploidentical HSCT. The primary aim was feasibility and safety with secondary aims of assessing the less frequently addressed issue of impact on immune reconstitution.Results: Nineteen patients with high-risk acute leukemia or myelodysplasia were enrolled. Engraftment occurred in 18 of 19 patients (95%). Pre-aDLI, 12 patients (63%) had bacteremia, nine of 17 at-risk patients (53%) reactivated CMV, and one developed acute GvHD. Sixteen patients received aDLI at dose levels 1 (103 T cells/kg, n = 4), 2 (104, n = 8), and 3 (105, n = 4). After aDLI, five patients developed clinically significant acute GvHD, and four of 14 at-risk patients (29%) reactivated CMV. T-cell recovery was significantly greater, and functional virus- and tumor-associated antigen-specific T cells were detectable earlier in patients receiving dose level 2 or 3 versus dose level 1/no aDLI. Alloanergization of donor cells expanded the CD4+ T-regulatory cell frequency within aDLI, which increased further in vivo without impeding expansion of virus- and tumor-associated antigen-specific T cells.Conclusions: These data demonstrate safety and a potential role for aDLI in contributing to immune reconstitution and expanding tolerogenic regulatory T cells in vivo after CD34-selected myeloablative haploidentical HSCT.

hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative treatment for many hematologic cancers. Use of haploidentical (mismatched) donors increases HSCT availability but is limited by severe graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and delayed immune reconstitution. Alloanergization of donor T cells is a simple approach to rebuild immunity while limiting GvHD after haploidentical HSCT, but the optimal T-cell dose and impact on immune reconstitution remain unknown.Patients and Methods: We performed a multicenter phase I trial of alloanergized donor lymphocyte infusion (aDLI) after CD34-selected myeloablative haploidentical HSCT. The primary aim was feasibility and safety with secondary aims of assessing the less frequently addressed issue of impact on immune reconstitution.Results: Nineteen patients with high-risk acute leukemia or myelodysplasia were enrolled. Engraftment occurred in 18 of 19 patients (95%). Pre-aDLI, 12 patients (63%) had bacteremia, nine of 17 at-risk patients (53%) reactivated CMV, and one developed acute GvHD. Sixteen patients received aDLI at dose levels 1 (103 T cells/kg, n = 4), 2 (104, n = 8), and 3 (105, n = 4). After aDLI, five patients developed clinically significant acute GvHD, and four of 14 at-risk patients (29%) reactivated CMV. T-cell recovery was significantly greater, and functional virus- and tumor-associated antigen-specific T cells were detectable earlier in patients receiving dose level 2 or 3 versus dose level 1/no aDLI. Alloanergization of donor cells expanded the CD4+ T-regulatory cell frequency within aDLI, which increased further in vivo without impeding expansion of virus- and tumor-associated antigen-specific T cells.Conclusions: These data demonstrate safety and a potential role for aDLI in contributing to immune reconstitution and expanding tolerogenic regulatory T cells in vivo after CD34-selected myeloablative haploidentical HSCT.

"abstractText": "Acute myeloid leukemia carries a dismal prognosis in older patients. The objective of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of decitabine combined with the CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor in newly diagnosed older patients with acute myeloid leukemia and to evaluate the effects of plerixafor on leukemia stem cells. Patients were treated with monthly cycles of decitabine 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> days 1-10 and escalating doses of plerixafor (320-810 mcg/kg) days 1-5. Sixty-nine patients were treated, with an overall response rate of 43%. Adverse karyotype did not predict response (<i>P</i>=0.31). Prior hypomethylating agent treatment was the strongest independent predictor of adverse overall survival (hazard ratio 3.1; 95%CI: 1.3-7.3; <i>P</i>=0.008) and response (14% in previously treated patients, 46% in treatment na\u00efve; <i>P</i>=0.002). As expected, the most common toxicities were myelosuppression and infection. Plerixafor induced mobilization of leukemia stem and progenitor cells, but did not cause clinically significant hyperleukocytosis.

The objective of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of decitabine combined with the CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor in newly diagnosed older patients with acute myeloid leukemia and to evaluate the effects of plerixafor on leukemia stem cells. Patients were treated with monthly cycles of decitabine 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> days 1-10 and escalating doses of plerixafor (320-810 mcg/kg) days 1-5. Sixty-nine patients were treated, with an overall response rate of 43%. Adverse karyotype did not predict response (<i>P</i>=0.31). Prior hypomethylating agent treatment was the strongest independent predictor of adverse overall survival (hazard ratio 3.1; 95%CI: 1.3-7.3; <i>P</i>=0.008) and response (14% in previously treated patients, 46% in treatment na\u00efve; <i>P</i>=0.002). As expected, the most common toxicities were myelosuppression and infection. Plerixafor induced mobilization of leukemia stem and progenitor cells, but did not cause clinically significant hyperleukocytosis.

Great hopes, however, are placed in growth factors that show neuroprotective abilities (e.g., nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) and in the immune modulating features, in particular, the anti-inflammatory effects. In our study we aimed to investigate whether a bone marrow-derived lineage-negative (Lin-) cells population, after autologous application into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), is able to produce noticeable concentrations of trophic factors and inflammatory-related proteins and thus influence the clinical course of ALS. To our knowledge, the evaluation of Lin- cells transplantation for ALS treatment has not been previously reported. Early hematopoietic Lin- cells were isolated from twelve ALS patients&rsquo; bone marrow, and later, the suspension of cells was administered into the subarachnoid space by lumbar puncture. Concentrations of selected proteins in the CSF and plasma were quantified by multiplex fluorescent bead-based immunoassays at different timepoints post-transplantation. We also chose microRNAs (miRNAs) related to muscle biology (miRNA-1, miRNA-133a, and miRNA-206) and angiogenesis and inflammation (miRNA-155 and miRNA-378) and tested, for the first time, their expression profiles in the CSF and plasma of ALS patients after Lin- cells transplantation. The injection of bone marrow cells resulted in decreased concentration of selected inflammatory proteins (C3) after Lin- cells injection, particularly in patients who had a better clinical outcome. Moreover, several analyzed miRNAs have changed expression levels in the CSF and plasma of ALS patients subsequent to Lin- cells administration. Interestingly, the expression of miR-206 increased in ALS patients, while miR-378 decreased both in the CSF and plasma one month after the cells&rsquo; injection. We propose that autologous lineage-negative early hematopoietic cells injected intrathecally may be a safe and feasible source of material for transplantations to the central nervous system (CNS) environment aimed at anti-inflammatory support provision for ALS adjuvant treatment strategies. Further research is needed to evaluate whether the observed effects could significantly influence the ALS progression.", "affiliation": "Department of General Pathology, Pomeranian Medical University, 70-111 Szczecin, Poland. ania.sobus@gmail.com.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Clinical Trial", "research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Subarachnoid Space"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Hematopoietic Stem Cells", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "IM", "qualifierName": "immunology", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "CH", "qualifierName": "chemistry", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Cerebrospinal Fluid", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "CH", "qualifierName": "chemistry", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "IM", "qualifierName": "immunology", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}, {"abbreviation": "TH", "qualifierName": "therapy", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "MicroRNAs", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "BL", "qualifierName": "blood", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "CF", "qualifierName": "cerebrospinal fluid", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "GE", "qualifierName": "genetics", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Spinal Puncture"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Transplantation, Autologous"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Adult"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Female"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Male"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Immunity, Humoral", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "IM", "qualifierName": "immunology", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Transcriptome", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "GE", "qualifierName": "genetics", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}}}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Complement", "Neurotrophins", "MicroRNA", "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Als)", "Lin- Cells", "Trophic Effects Of Stem Cell-based Therapy"]}, "chemicalList": {"chemical": {"name": "MicroRNAs", "registryNumber": "0"}}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms19051312"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5983708"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5983708?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "12", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "Y", "tmAccessionTypeList": {"accessionType": "nct"}, "dateOfCompletion": "2018-10-01", "dateOfCreation": "2018-04-28", "firstIndexDate": "2018-04-28", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-11", "dateOfRevision": "2019-01-24", "electronicPublicationDate": "2018-04-27", "firstPublicationDate": "2018-04-27"}, "htmllinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5983708", "abstract": "Therapeutic options for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are still limited.

"pageInfo": "880-897", "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>No regenerative approach has thus far been shown to be effective in skeletal muscle injuries, despite their high frequency and associated functional deficits. We sought to address surgical trauma-related muscle injuries using local intraoperative application of allogeneic placenta-derived, mesenchymal-like adherent cells (PLX-PAD), using hip arthroplasty as a standardized injury model, because of the high regenerative and immunomodulatory potency of this cell type.<h4>Methods</h4>Our pilot phase I/IIa study was prospective, randomized, double blind, and placebo-controlled. Twenty patients undergoing hip arthroplasty via a direct lateral approach received an injection of 3.0 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> (300 M, n = 6) or 1.5 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> (150\u00a0M, n\u00a0=\u00a07) PLX-PAD or a placebo (n\u00a0=\u00a07) into the injured gluteus medius muscles.<h4>Results</h4>We did not observe any relevant PLX-PAD-related adverse events at the 2-year follow-up. Improved gluteus medius strength was noted as early as Week 6 in the treatment-groups. Surprisingly, until Week 26, the low-dose group outperformed the high-dose group and reached significantly improved strength compared with placebo [150\u00a0M vs. placebo: P\u00a0=\u00a00.007 (baseline adjusted; 95% confidence interval 7.6, 43.9); preoperative baseline values mean \u00b1 SE: placebo: 24.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7\u00a0Nm, 150\u00a0M: 27.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.6 Nm], mirrored by an increase in muscle volume [150\u00a0M vs. placebo: P\u00a0=\u00a00.004 (baseline adjusted; 95% confidence interval 6.0, 30.0); preoperative baseline values GM volume: placebo: 211.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.3 cm<sup>3</sup> , 150\u00a0M: 237.4\u00a0\u00b1 27.2\u00a0cm<sup>3</sup> ]. Histology indicated accelerated healing after cell therapy.

We sought to address surgical trauma-related muscle injuries using local intraoperative application of allogeneic placenta-derived, mesenchymal-like adherent cells (PLX-PAD), using hip arthroplasty as a standardized injury model, because of the high regenerative and immunomodulatory potency of this cell type.<h4>Methods</h4>Our pilot phase I/IIa study was prospective, randomized, double blind, and placebo-controlled. Twenty patients undergoing hip arthroplasty via a direct lateral approach received an injection of 3.0 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> (300 M, n = 6) or 1.5 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> (150\u00a0M, n\u00a0=\u00a07) PLX-PAD or a placebo (n\u00a0=\u00a07) into the injured gluteus medius muscles.<h4>Results</h4>We did not observe any relevant PLX-PAD-related adverse events at the 2-year follow-up. Improved gluteus medius strength was noted as early as Week 6 in the treatment-groups. Surprisingly, until Week 26, the low-dose group outperformed the high-dose group and reached significantly improved strength compared with placebo [150\u00a0M vs. placebo: P\u00a0=\u00a00.007 (baseline adjusted; 95% confidence interval 7.6, 43.9); preoperative baseline values mean \u00b1 SE: placebo: 24.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7\u00a0Nm, 150\u00a0M: 27.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.6 Nm], mirrored by an increase in muscle volume [150\u00a0M vs. placebo: P\u00a0=\u00a00.004 (baseline adjusted; 95% confidence interval 6.0, 30.0); preoperative baseline values GM volume: placebo: 211.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.3 cm<sup>3</sup> , 150\u00a0M: 237.4\u00a0\u00b1 27.2\u00a0cm<sup>3</sup> ].

The purpose of the present analysis was to explore whether measures of electroencephalography (EEG) theta, alpha, and beta power showed evidence of change after treatment and whether baseline EEG characteristics were predictive of clinical improvement. The primary endpoint was the parent-reported Vineland adaptive behavior scales-II socialization subscale score, collected at baseline, 6- and 12-month visits. In addition, the expressive one word picture vocabulary test 4 and the clinical global impression-improvement scale were administered. Electrophysiological recordings were taken during viewing of dynamic social and nonsocial stimuli at 6 and 12 months post-treatment. Significant changes in EEG spectral characteristics were found by 12 months post-infusion, which were characterized by increased alpha and beta power and decreased EEG theta power. Furthermore, higher baseline posterior EEG beta power was associated with a greater degree of improvement in social communication symptoms, highlighting the potential for an EEG biomarker to predict variation in outcome. Taken together, the results suggest that EEG measures may be useful endpoints for future ASD clinical trials.

Programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor blockade is active in classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) despite reported deficiencies of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression on HRS cells. Herein, we assess bases of sensitivity to PD-1 blockade in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL who were treated with nivolumab (anti-PD-1) in the CheckMate 205 trial. Methods HRS cells from archival tumor biopsies were evaluated for 9p24.1 alterations by fluorescence in situ hybridization and for expression of PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) and the antigen presentation pathway components-\u03b22-microglobulin, MHC class I, and MHC class II-by immunohistochemistry. These parameters were correlated with clinical responses and progression-free survival (PFS) after PD-1 blockade. Results Patients with higher-level 9p24.1 copy gain and increased PD-L1 expression on HRS cells had superior PFS. HRS cell expression of \u03b22-microglobulin/MHC class I was not predictive for complete remission or PFS after nivolumab therapy. In contrast, HRS cell expression of MHC class II was predictive for complete remission. In patients with a > 12-month interval between myeloablative autologous stem-cell transplantation and nivolumab therapy, HRS cell expression of MHC class II was associated with prolonged PFS. Conclusion Genetically driven PD-L1 expression and MHC class II positivity on HRS cells are potential predictors of favorable outcome after PD-1 blockade. In cHL, clinical responses to nivolumab were not dependent on HRS cell expression of MHC class I.", "affiliation": "Margaretha G.M. Roemer, Robert A. Redd, Fathima Zumla Cader, Christine J.

presentation. Programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor blockade is active in classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) despite reported deficiencies of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression on HRS cells. Herein, we assess bases of sensitivity to PD-1 blockade in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL who were treated with nivolumab (anti-PD-1) in the CheckMate 205 trial. Methods HRS cells from archival tumor biopsies were evaluated for 9p24.1 alterations by fluorescence in situ hybridization and for expression of PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) and the antigen presentation pathway components-\u03b22-microglobulin, MHC class I, and MHC class II-by immunohistochemistry. These parameters were correlated with clinical responses and progression-free survival (PFS) after PD-1 blockade. Results Patients with higher-level 9p24.1 copy gain and increased PD-L1 expression on HRS cells had superior PFS. HRS cell expression of \u03b22-microglobulin/MHC class I was not predictive for complete remission or PFS after nivolumab therapy. In contrast, HRS cell expression of MHC class II was predictive for complete remission. In patients with a > 12-month interval between myeloablative autologous stem-cell transplantation and nivolumab therapy, HRS cell expression of MHC class II was associated with prolonged PFS. Conclusion Genetically driven PD-L1 expression and MHC class II positivity on HRS cells are potential predictors of favorable outcome after PD-1 blockade. In cHL, clinical responses to nivolumab were not dependent on HRS cell expression of MHC class I.", "journaltitle": "Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical

No dose-limiting toxicities were reported in cycle 1; the RP2D was 3\u00b70\u00a0mg based on overall tolerability across multiple cycles. In 62 evaluable patients, the confirmed overall response rate was 94% (68% \u2265very good partial response; 24% complete response). Median progression-free survival was 24\u00b79\u00a0months. Responses (median duration 36\u00b79\u00a0months for patients receiving the RP2D) deepened during treatment. Grade 3 drug-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 64% of patients, including: rash, 13%; peripheral neuropathy, 8%; hyperglycaemia, 8%. There were no grade 4 drug-related AEs.

with endothelial dysfunction leading to cardiovascular disease. CD34+ endothelial Progenitor Cells (EPCs) are responsible for endothelial repair and neo-angiogenesis and can be used as a cardiovascular disease risk biomarker. This study investigated whether the addition of saxagliptin, a DPP-IV inhibitor, to metformin, may reduce cardiovascular disease risk in addition to improving glycemic control in Type 2 diabetes patients. METHODS:In 12\u00a0week, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial, 42 subjects already taking metformin 1-2 grams/day were randomized to placebo or saxagliptin 5\u00a0mg. Subjects aged 40-70\u00a0years with diabetes for <\u200910\u00a0years, with no known cardiovascular disease, BMI 25-39.9, HbA1C 6-9% were included. We evaluated EPCs number, function, surface markers and gene expression, in addition to arterial stiffness, blood biochemistries, resting energy expenditure, and body composition parameters. A mixed model regression to examine saxagliptin vs placebo, accounting for within-subject autocorrelation, was done with SAS (p\u2009<\u20090.05). RESULTS:Although there was no significant increase in CD34+ cell number, CD31+ cells percentage increased. Saxagliptin increased migration (in response to SDF1\u03b1) with a trend of higher colony formation count. MNCs cytometry showed higher percentage of CXCR4 double positivity for both CD34 and CD31 positive cells, indicating a functional improvement. Gene expression analysis showed an upregulation in CD34+ cells for antioxidant SOD1 (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and a downregulation in CD34- cells for IL-6 (p\u2009<\u20090.01). For arterial stiffness, both augmentation index and systolic blood pressure measures went down in saxagliptin subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.05). CONCLUSION:Saxagliptin, in combination with metformin, can help improve endothelial dysfunction in early diabetes before macrovascular complications appear.

adipose stem cells (ASCs) in omental, retroperitoneal and subcutaneous adipose tissues of women with endometrial cancer.<h4>Patients & methods</h4>ASCs were collected from 22 women, aged 35-83 years, undergoing hysterectomy for endometrial cancer.

However, its efficacy in B-ALL patients with extramedullary involvement is limited due to poor responses and neurotoxicity. Here, we utilized a third generation of CAR T cell vector, which contains the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (ITR) domain of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), to generate 1928zT2 T cells targeting CD19, and evaluated the efficacy of 1928zT2 T cells in relapse or refractory B-ALL patients with extramedullary involvement. METHODS:1928zT2 T cells were generated by 19-28z-TLR2 lentiviral vector transfection into primary human T lymphocytes. The anti-leukemia effect of 1928zT2 T cells were determined by killing assays and in xenografts. Three patients diagnosed as relapse or refractory ALL with extramedullary involvement were infused with 1928zT2 T cells, and the clinical responses were evaluated by BM smear, B-ultrasonography, PET/CT, histology, flow cytometry, qPCR, ELISA, and luminex assay. RESULTS:1928zT2 T cells exhibited enhanced effector function against CD19+ leukemic cells in vitro and in a xenograft model of human extramedullary leukemia. Notably, the 1928zT2 T cells eradicated extramedullary leukemia and induced complete remission in the three relapse and refractory ALL patients without serious adverse effects. 1928zT2 T cells expanded robustly in the circulation of these three patients and were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of patient 3. These three patients experienced cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with grade 2 or 3, which remitted spontaneously or after tocilizumab treatment. None of the three patients suffered neurotoxicity or needed further intensive care. CONCLUSIONS:Our results demonstrate that 1928zT2 T cells with TLR2 incorporation augment anti-leukemic effects, particularly for eradicating extramedullary leukemia cells, and suggest that the infusion of 1928zT2 T cells is an encouraging treatment for relapsed/refractory ALL patients with extramedullary involvement.

cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) are 2 promising cell types being evaluated for patients with heart failure (HF) secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy. No information is available in humans about the relative efficacy of MSCs and CPCs and whether their combination is more efficacious than either cell type alone.<h4>Objective</h4>CONCERT-HF (Combination of Mesenchymal and c-kit<sup>+</sup> Cardiac Stem Cells As Regenerative Therapy for Heart Failure) is a phase II trial aimed at elucidating these issues by assessing the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of transendocardial administration of autologous MSCs and CPCs, alone and in combination, in patients with HF caused by chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy (coronary artery disease and old myocardial infarction).<h4>Methods and results</h4>Using a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter, multitreatment, and adaptive design, CONCERT-HF examines whether administration of MSCs alone, CPCs alone, or MSCs+CPCs in this population alleviates left ventricular remodeling and dysfunction, reduces scar size, improves quality of life, or augments functional capacity. The 4-arm design enables comparisons of MSCs alone with CPCs alone and with their combination. CONCERT-HF consists of 162 patients, 18 in a safety lead-in phase (stage 1) and 144 in the main trial (stage 2).

Enasidenib is an oral inhibitor of mutant-IDH2 proteins. This first-in-human phase 1/2 study evaluated enasidenib doses of 50 to 650 mg/d, administered in continuous 28-day cycles, in patients with mutant-<i>IDH2</i> hematologic malignancies. Overall, 214 of 345 patients (62%) with relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML received enasidenib, 100 mg/d. Median age was 68 years. Forty-two patients (19.6%) attained complete remission (CR), 19 patients (10.3%) proceeded to an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, and the overall response rate was 38.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 32.2-45.7). Median overall survival was 8.8 months (95% CI, 7.7-9.6). Response and survival were comparable among patients with <i>IDH2</i>-R140 or <i>IDH2</i>-R172 mutations. Response rates were similar among patients who, at study entry, were in relapse (37.7%) or were refractory to intensive (37.5%) or nonintensive (43.2%) therapies. Sixty-six (43.1%) red blood cell transfusion-dependent and 53 (40.2%) platelet transfusion-dependent patients achieved transfusion independence. The magnitude of 2-HG reduction on study was associated with CR in <i>IDH2</i>-R172 patients. Clearance of mutant-<i>IDH2</i> clones was also associated with achievement of CR. Among all 345 patients, the most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were hyperbilirubinemia (10%), thrombocytopenia (7%), and IDH differentiation syndrome (6%). Enasidenib was well tolerated and induced molecular remissions and hematologic responses in patients with AML for whom prior treatments had failed.

have isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (<i>IDH2</i>) mutations, which occur at active site arginine residues R140 and R172. <i>IDH2</i> mutations produce an oncometabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which leads to DNA and histone hypermethylation and impaired hematopoietic differentiation. Enasidenib is an oral inhibitor of mutant-IDH2 proteins. This first-in-human phase 1/2 study evaluated enasidenib doses of 50 to 650 mg/d, administered in continuous 28-day cycles, in patients with mutant-<i>IDH2</i> hematologic malignancies. Overall, 214 of 345 patients (62%) with relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML received enasidenib, 100 mg/d. Median age was 68 years. Forty-two patients (19.6%) attained complete remission (CR), 19 patients (10.3%) proceeded to an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, and the overall response rate was 38.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 32.2-45.7). Median overall survival was 8.8 months (95% CI, 7.7-9.6). Response and survival were comparable among patients with <i>IDH2</i>-R140 or <i>IDH2</i>-R172 mutations. Response rates were similar among patients who, at study entry, were in relapse (37.7%) or were refractory to intensive (37.5%) or nonintensive (43.2%) therapies. Sixty-six (43.1%) red blood cell transfusion-dependent and 53 (40.2%) platelet transfusion-dependent patients achieved transfusion independence. The magnitude of 2-HG reduction on study was associated with CR in <i>IDH2</i>-R172 patients. Clearance of mutant-<i>IDH2</i> clones was also associated with achievement of CR. Among all 345 patients, the most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were hyperbilirubinemia (10%), thrombocytopenia (7%), and IDH differentiation syndrome (6%). Enasidenib was well tolerated and induced molecular remissions and hematologic responses in patients with AML for whom prior treatments had failed. The study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01915498.", "journaltitle": "Blood", "authorinfo": ["Stein EM", "DiNardo CD", "Fathi AT", "Pollyea DA", "Stone RM", "Altman JK", "Roboz GJ",

Taurolidine is a non-antibiotic agent with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, which has been used as a lock solution to prevent CRBSI in some settings. However, little is known about its usefulness in high-risk adult neutropenic patients with cancer. This prospective randomised clinical trial aims to test the hypothesis that taurolidine-citrate lock solution is more effective than placebo for preventing catheter infection in neutropenic haematological patients. METHODS:This study is a prospective, multicentre, randomised, double-blinded, parallel, superiority, placebo-controlled trial. Patients with haematological cancer who are expected to develop prolonged neutropenia (>\u20097\u00a0days) and who have a non-tunnelled CVC implanted will be randomised to receive prophylactic taurolidine-citrate-heparin solution using a lock technique (study group) or heparin alone (placebo group). The primary endpoint will be bacterial colonisation of the CVC hubs. The secondary endpoints will be the incidence of CRBSI, CVC removal, adverse events, and 30-day case-fatality rate. DISCUSSION:The lock technique is a preventive strategy that inhibits bacterial colonisation in the catheter hubs, which is the initial step of endoluminal catheter colonisation and the development of infection. Taurolidine is a nontoxic agent that does not develop antibiotic resistance because it acts as an antiseptic rather than an antibiotic. Taurolidine has shown controversial results in the few trials conducted in cancer patients. These studies have important limitations due to the lack of data on adult and/or high-risk neutropenic patients, the type of catheters studied (tunnelled or ports), and the lack of information regarding the intervention (e.g. dwelling of the solution, time, and periodicity of the lock technique). If our hypothesis is proven, the study could provide important solid evidence on the potential usefulness of this preventive procedure in a population at high risk of CRBSI, in whom this complication may significantly impair patient outcome.

infection (CRBSI) is one of the most frequent complications in patients with cancer who have central venous catheters (CVCs) implanted and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Taurolidine is a non-antibiotic agent with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, which has been used as a lock solution to prevent CRBSI in some settings. However, little is known about its usefulness in high-risk adult neutropenic patients with cancer. This prospective randomised clinical trial aims to test the hypothesis that taurolidine-citrate lock solution is more effective than placebo for preventing catheter infection in neutropenic haematological patients. METHODS:This study is a prospective, multicentre, randomised, double-blinded, parallel, superiority, placebo-controlled trial. Patients with haematological cancer who are expected to develop prolonged neutropenia (>\u20097\u00a0days) and who have a non-tunnelled CVC implanted will be randomised to receive prophylactic taurolidine-citrate-heparin solution using a lock technique (study group) or heparin alone (placebo group). The primary endpoint will be bacterial colonisation of the CVC hubs. The secondary endpoints will be the incidence of CRBSI, CVC removal, adverse events, and 30-day case-fatality rate. DISCUSSION:The lock technique is a preventive strategy that inhibits bacterial colonisation in the catheter hubs, which is the initial step of endoluminal catheter colonisation and the development of infection. Taurolidine is a nontoxic agent that does not develop antibiotic resistance because it acts as an antiseptic rather than an antibiotic. Taurolidine has shown controversial results in the few trials conducted in cancer patients. These studies have important limitations due to the lack of data on adult and/or high-risk neutropenic patients, the type of catheters studied (tunnelled or ports), and the lack of information regarding the intervention (e.g. dwelling of the solution, time, and periodicity of the lock technique). If our hypothesis is proven, the study could provide important solid evidence on the potential usefulness of this preventive procedure in a population at high risk of CRBSI, in whom this complication may significantly impair patient outcome.

This phase 1 dose-escalation/expansion study assessed the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of INCB040093, a selective PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor, as monotherapy or combined with itacitinib (formerly INCB039110), a selective JAK1 inhibitor, in adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell lymphomas. Final results are reported. Overall, 114 patients were treated (monotherapy, n = 49; combination therapy, n = 72 [7 patients crossed over from monotherapy to combination]). INCB040093 100 mg twice daily (monotherapy) and INCB040093 100 mg twice daily + itacitinib 300 mg once daily (combination) were the recommended phase 2 doses. One dose-limiting toxicity (gastrointestinal bleed secondary to gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL] regression) occurred with monotherapy. The most common serious adverse events with monotherapy were pneumonia (n = 5) and pyrexia (n = 4), and with combination <i>Pneumocystis jiroveci</i> pneumonia (n = 5), pneumonia (unrelated to <i>P jiroveci</i>; n = 5), and pyrexia (n = 4). Grade 3 or higher transaminase elevations were less common with combination. INCB040093 was active across the B-cell lymphomas; 63% of patients (5/8) with follicular lymphoma responded to monotherapy.

This phase 1 dose-escalation/expansion study assessed the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of INCB040093, a selective PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor, as monotherapy or combined with itacitinib (formerly INCB039110), a selective JAK1 inhibitor, in adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell lymphomas. Final results are reported. Overall, 114 patients were treated (monotherapy, n = 49; combination therapy, n = 72 [7 patients crossed over from monotherapy to combination]). INCB040093 100 mg twice daily (monotherapy) and INCB040093 100 mg twice daily + itacitinib 300 mg once daily (combination) were the recommended phase 2 doses. One dose-limiting toxicity (gastrointestinal bleed secondary to gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL] regression) occurred with monotherapy. The most common serious adverse events with monotherapy were pneumonia (n = 5) and pyrexia (n = 4), and with combination <i>Pneumocystis jiroveci</i> pneumonia (n = 5), pneumonia (unrelated to <i>P jiroveci</i>; n = 5), and pyrexia (n = 4). Grade 3 or higher transaminase elevations were less common with combination. INCB040093 was active across the B-cell lymphomas; 63% of patients (5/8) with follicular lymphoma responded to monotherapy.

Among all 678 patients, 5-year event-free survival (EFS) was 87% (95% confidence interval [CI], 84-89) and overall survival 93% (95% CI, 90-94). Five-year disease-free survival of SR patients (N = 407) was 94% (95% CI, 91-96), HR (N = 176) was 84% (95% CI, 77-88), and VHR (N = 65) was 79% (95% CI, 67-87). IKZF1 deletion was present in 62 of 385 (16%) assessed patients and was associated with inferior 5-year EFS (63%; 95% CI, 49%-74% vs 88%; 95% CI, 84%-91%; P < .001), and higher 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse, including among those with low MRD (24% vs 8%, P = .001). In multivariable analysis, age \u226515 years, WBC \u226550\u2009\u00d7 109/L, IKZF1 deletion, and MRD \u226510-4 was each associated with inferior outcome. In conclusion, risk-stratified therapy on DFCI 05-001 resulted in favorable outcomes for B-ALL patients, including those with VHR features.

A secondary objective of this study was to assess the impact of blinatumomab on health-related quality of life (HRQL) as measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30). This analysis included the 342 of 405 randomized patients for whom baseline and \u22651 postbaseline result were available in any EORTC multi-item scale or single-item measure. In general, patients receiving blinatumomab (n = 247) reported better posttreatment HRQL across all QLQ-C30 subscales, based on descriptive mean change from baseline, than did those receiving chemotherapy (n = 95). The hazard ratios for time to deterioration (TTD) of \u226510 points from baseline in HRQL or death ranged from 0.42 to 0.81 in favor of blinatumomab, with the upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval <1.0 across all measures, except insomnia, social functioning, and financial difficulties; sensitivity analysis of TTD in HRQL without the event of death were consistent with these findings.

A secondary objective of this study was to assess the impact of blinatumomab on health-related quality of life (HRQL) as measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30). This analysis included the 342 of 405 randomized patients for whom baseline and \u22651 postbaseline result were available in any EORTC multi-item scale or single-item measure. In general, patients receiving blinatumomab (n = 247) reported better posttreatment HRQL across all QLQ-C30 subscales, based on descriptive mean change from baseline, than did those receiving chemotherapy (n = 95). The hazard ratios for time to deterioration (TTD) of \u226510 points from baseline in HRQL or death ranged from 0.42 to 0.81 in favor of blinatumomab, with the upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval <1.0 across all measures, except insomnia, social functioning, and financial difficulties; sensitivity analysis of TTD in HRQL without the event of death were consistent with these findings.

There is no cure for knee OA, and for some people, the disease may involve progressive symptomatic and structural deterioration over time. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a therapeutic agent that aims to address underlying biological processes responsible for OA pathogenesis. As such, it has the potential to improve both symptoms and joint structure. The aim of this clinical trial is to determine whether a series of injections of PRP into the knee joint will lead to a significantly greater reduction in knee pain, and less loss of medial tibial cartilage volume over 12\u00a0months when compared to a series of placebo saline injections in people with knee OA.<h4>Methods</h4>This will be a two-group, superiority, randomised, participant-, interventionist- and assessor-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Two hundred and eighty-eight participants aged over 50\u00a0years with painful knee OA and mild to moderate structural change on x-ray (Kellgren and Lawrence grade 2 and 3) will be randomly allocated to receive either three PRP injections or three normal saline injections into the knee joint at weekly intervals. The primary outcomes will be 12-month change in average overall knee pain severity (numeric rating scale) and medial tibial cartilage volume (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)). Secondary outcomes include additional measures of knee pain and other symptoms, function in daily living and sport and recreation, quality of life, participant-perceived global ratings of change, and other MRI structural outcomes including meniscal and cartilage morphology, synovitis, effusion, bone marrow lesions and cartilage defects. A range of additional measures will be recorded, and a separate health economic evaluation will be performed.<h4>Discussion</h4>The findings from this study will help determine whether PRP improves both clinical and structural knee OA outcomes over 12\u00a0months when compared to a series of placebo saline injections.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry reference: ACTRN12617000853347 .

Larotrectinib, a highly selective small-molecule inhibitor of the TRK kinases, had shown activity in preclinical models and in adults with tumours harbouring TRK fusions. This study aimed to assess the safety of larotrectinib in paediatric patients.<h4>Methods</h4>This multicentre, open-label, phase 1/2 study was done at eight sites in the USA and enrolled infants, children, and adolescents aged 1 month to 21 years with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours or CNS tumours that had relapsed, progressed, or were non-responsive to available therapies regardless of TRK fusion status; had a Karnofsky (\u226516 years of age) or Lansky (<16 years of age) performance status score of 50 or more, adequate organ function, and full recovery from the acute toxic effects of all previous anticancer therapy. Following a protocol amendment on Sept 12, 2016, patients with locally advanced infantile fibrosarcoma who would require disfiguring surgery to achieve a complete surgical resection were also eligible. Patients were enrolled to three dose cohorts according to a rolling six design. Larotrectinib was administered orally (capsule or liquid formulation), twice daily, on a continuous 28-day schedule, in increasing doses adjusted for age and bodyweight. The primary endpoint of the phase 1 dose escalation component was the safety of larotrectinib, including dose-limiting toxicity. All patients who received at least one dose of larotrectinib were included in the safety analyses. Reported here are results of the phase 1 dose escalation cohort. Phase 1 follow-up and phase 2 are ongoing. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02637687.<h4>Findings</h4>Between Dec 21, 2015, and April 13, 2017, 24 patients (n=17 with tumours harbouring TRK fusions, n=7 without a documented TRK fusion) with a median age of 4\u00b75 years (IQR 1\u00b73-13\u00b73) were enrolled to three dose cohorts: cohorts 1 and 2 were assigned doses on the basis of both age and bodyweight predicted by use of SimCyp modelling to achieve an area under the curve equivalent to the adult doses of 100 mg twice daily (cohort 1) and 150 mg twice daily (cohort 2); and cohort 3 was assigned to receive a dose of 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> twice daily (maximum 100 mg per dose), regardless of age, equating to a maximum of 173% of the recommended adult phase 2 dose. Among enrolled patients harbouring TRK fusion-positive cancers, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. Adverse events were predominantly grade 1 or 2 (occurring in 21 [88%] of 24 patients); the most common larotrectinib-related adverse events of all grades were increased alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ten [42%] of 24 each), leucopenia (five [21%] of 24), decreased neutrophil count (five [21%] of 24), and vomiting (five [21%] of 24). Grade 3 alanine aminotransferase elevation was the only dose-limiting toxicity and occurred in one patient without a TRK fusion and with progressive disease. No grade 4 or 5 treatment-related adverse events were observed. Two larotrectinib-related serious adverse events were observed: grade 3 nausea and grade 3 ejection fraction decrease during the 28-day follow-up after discontinuing larotrectinib and while on anthracyclines. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached, and 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (maximum of 100 mg per dose) was established as the recommended phase 2 dose. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response. None of the seven patients with TRK fusion-negative cancers had an objective response.<h4>Interpretation</h4>The TRK inhibitor larotrectinib was well tolerated in paediatric patients and showed encouraging antitumour activity in all patients with TRK fusion-positive tumours. The recommended phase 2 dose was defined as 100mg/m<sup>2</sup> (maximum 100 mg per dose) for infants, children, and adolescents, regardless of age.<h4>Funding</h4>Loxo Oncology Inc.", "affiliation": "University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center/Children's Health, Dallas, TX, USA.

testing, alisertib tablets with irinotecan and temozolomide showed significant antitumor activity in patients with neuroblastoma. This study sought to confirm activity of this regimen; evaluate an alisertib oral solution; and evaluate biomarkers of clinical outcomes.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>We conducted a two-stage phase II trial of alisertib tablets (60 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/dose \u00d7 7 days), irinotecan (50 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/dose i.v. \u00d7 5 days), and temozolomide (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/dose orally \u00d7 5 days) in patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma.

allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). In this open-label single-group pilot study, 18 subjects were enrolled before allo-HCT and planned to receive third-party FMT capsules. FMT capsules were administered no later than 4 weeks after neutrophil engraftment, and antibiotics were not allowed within 48 hours before FMT. Five patients did not receive FMT because of the development of early acute gastrointestinal (GI) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) before FMT (n = 3), persistent HCT-associated GI toxicity (n = 1), or patient decision (n = 1). Thirteen patients received FMT at a median of 27 days (range, 19-45 days) after HCT. Participants were able to swallow and tolerate all FMT capsules, meeting the primary study endpoint of feasibility. FMT was tolerated well, with 1 treatment-related significant adverse event (abdominal pain). Two patients subsequently developed acute GI GVHD, with 1 patient also having concurrent bacteremia. No additional cases of bacteremia occurred. Median follow-up for survivors is 15 months (range, 13-20 months). The Kaplan-Meier estimates for 12-month overall survival and progression-free survival after FMT were 85% (95% confidence interval, 51%-96%) and 85% (95% confidence interval, 51%-96%), respectively. There was 1 nonrelapse death resulting from acute GI GVHD (12-month nonrelapse mortality, 8%; 95% confidence interval, 0%-30%). Analysis of stool composition and urine 3-indoxyl sulfate concentration indicated improvement in intestinal microbiome diversity after FMT that was associated with expansion of stool-donor taxa. These results indicate that empiric third-party FMT after allo-HCT appears to be feasible, safe, and associated with expansion of recipient microbiome diversity.

The combination of lenalidomide and rituximab demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 66% with a complete response (CR) of 12% in the relapsed/refractory setting. Based on these data, we conducted a phase 1 study of rituximab (R), lenalidomide (L), and ibrutinib (I) in relapsed/refractory CLL. Patients received R 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> cycles 1 to 6 day 1, L on cycles 1 to 12 days 1 to 21, and I until disease progression. Dose escalation used a standard 3+3 design from a dose level (DL) of L 5 mg (DL1) and increasing to 15 mg (DL3) for a total of 3 dose levels. Twelve patients were enrolled; there were 2 dose-limiting toxicities of grade 4 neutropenia at DL3; thus, DL2 was the recommended phase 2 dose. A high incidence of sustained grade 4 neutropenia occurred at all dose levels, prompting study withdrawal in 5 patients, despite growth factor support. The ORR was 67%; ORR at the RP2D was 100% (1 CR). The 12-month progression-free survival at the RP2D was 83%.

The combination of lenalidomide and rituximab demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 66% with a complete response (CR) of 12% in the relapsed/refractory setting. Based on these data, we conducted a phase 1 study of rituximab (R), lenalidomide (L), and ibrutinib (I) in relapsed/refractory CLL. Patients received R 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> cycles 1 to 6 day 1, L on cycles 1 to 12 days 1 to 21, and I until disease progression. Dose escalation used a standard 3+3 design from a dose level (DL) of L 5 mg (DL1) and increasing to 15 mg (DL3) for a total of 3 dose levels. Twelve patients were enrolled; there were 2 dose-limiting toxicities of grade 4 neutropenia at DL3; thus, DL2 was the recommended phase 2 dose. A high incidence of sustained grade 4 neutropenia occurred at all dose levels, prompting study withdrawal in 5 patients, despite growth factor support. The ORR was 67%; ORR at the RP2D was 100% (1 CR). The 12-month progression-free survival at the RP2D was 83%.

GVHD occurs when donor lymphocytes are activated by inflammatory cytokines and alloantigens. The role of donor biologic characteristics, such as basal inflammation, has not been investigated as a risk factor for GVHD but is theoretically transferrable to the recipient. We evaluated donor serum and plasma concentrations of cytokines and adipokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-\u03b1, leptin, suppression of tumorigenicity-2, and adiponectin) from test (n\u202f=\u202f210) and replication (n\u202f=\u202f250) cohorts of matched, unrelated transplant peripheral blood stem cell recipients identified through the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation Research between 2000 and 2011 for hematologic malignancies. Hazard ratios were estimated for acute (grades II to IV and III to IV) and chronic GVHD, overall survival, disease-free survival, transplant-related mortality, and relapse for each cytokine or adipokine, adjusting for significant covariates. The lowest cytokine quartile was considered as the reference group for each model. To account for multiple testing P < .01 was considered the threshold for significance. In the test cohort a borderline significant association was identified between donor serum IL-1\u03b2 concentrations and grades III to IV acute GVHD in the recipient (P = .01), and a significant inverse association was identified between donor TNF-\u03b1 concentrations and chronic GVHD (P = .006).

GVHD occurs when donor lymphocytes are activated by inflammatory cytokines and alloantigens. The role of donor biologic characteristics, such as basal inflammation, has not been investigated as a risk factor for GVHD but is theoretically transferrable to the recipient. We evaluated donor serum and plasma concentrations of cytokines and adipokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-\u03b1, leptin, suppression of tumorigenicity-2, and adiponectin) from test (n\u202f=\u202f210) and replication (n\u202f=\u202f250) cohorts of matched, unrelated transplant peripheral blood stem cell recipients identified through the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation Research between 2000 and 2011 for hematologic malignancies. Hazard ratios were estimated for acute (grades II to IV and III to IV) and chronic GVHD, overall survival, disease-free survival, transplant-related mortality, and relapse for each cytokine or adipokine, adjusting for significant covariates. The lowest cytokine quartile was considered as the reference group for each model. To account for multiple testing P < .01 was considered the threshold for significance. In the test cohort a borderline significant association was identified between donor serum IL-1\u03b2 concentrations and grades III to IV acute GVHD in the recipient (P = .01), and a significant inverse association was identified between donor TNF-\u03b1 concentrations and chronic GVHD (P = .006).

T-cell-depleted alloSCT with postponed donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) may reduce GVHD, because tissue injury can be restored at the time of DLI. In this study, we investigated the presence of tissue injury and inflammation in skin during the period of hematologic recovery and immune reconstitution after alloSCT. Methods:Skin biopsies were immunohistochemically stained for HLA class II, CD1a, CD11c, CD40, CD54, CD68, CD86, CD206, CD3, and CD8. HLA class II-expressing cells were characterized as activated T-cells, antigen-presenting cells (APCs), or tissue repairing macrophages.

Results:No inflammatory environment due to pretransplant conditioning was detected at the time of alloSCT, irrespective of the conditioning regimen.

In the absence of GVHD, patient derived macrophages were gradually replaced by donor-derived macrophages although patient-derived macrophages were detectable even 24\u2009weeks after alloSCT. Conclusion:Conditioning regimens cause tissue damage in the skin, but this does not result in a local increase of activated APC. In contrast to the inflamed situation in GVHD, when interaction takes place between activated APC and donor T-cells, the tissue damage caused by myeloablative alloSCT results in dermal recruitment of HLA class II-positive tissue repairing macrophages co-existing with increased numbers of patient- and donor-derived T-cells, but without signs of specific interaction and initiation of an immune response.

However, the safety and efficacy of allogeneic donor-derived LMP-specific T cells (LMP-Ts) have not been established for patients who have undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). Therefore, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of donor-derived LMP-Ts in 26 patients who had undergone allogeneic HSCT for EBV-associated natural killer/T-cell or B-cell lymphomas. Seven patients received LMP-Ts as therapy for active disease, and 19 were treated with adjuvant therapy for high-risk disease. There were no immediate infusion-related toxicities, and only 1 dose-limiting toxicity potentially related to T-cell infusion was seen. The 2-year overall survival (OS) was 68%. Additionally, patients who received T-cell therapy while in complete remission after allogeneic HSCT had a 78% OS at 2 years. Patients treated for B-cell disease (n = 10) had a 2-year OS of 80%. Patients with T-cell disease had a 2-year OS of 60%, which suggests an improvement compared with published posttransplantation 2-year OS rates of 30% to 50%. Hence, this study shows that donor-derived LMP-Ts are a safe and effective therapy to prevent relapse after transplantation in patients with B cell- or T cell-derived EBV-associated lymphoma or lymphoproliferative disorder and supports the infusion of LMP-Ts as adjuvant therapy to improve outcomes in the posttransplantation setting.

"Autologous T cells targeting Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane proteins (LMPs) have shown safety and efficacy in the treatment of patients with type 2 latency EBV-associated lymphomas for whom standard therapies have failed, including high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem-cell rescue. However, the safety and efficacy of allogeneic donor-derived LMP-specific T cells (LMP-Ts) have not been established for patients who have undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). Therefore, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of donor-derived LMP-Ts in 26 patients who had undergone allogeneic HSCT for EBV-associated natural killer/T-cell or B-cell lymphomas. Seven patients received LMP-Ts as therapy for active disease, and 19 were treated with adjuvant therapy for high-risk disease. There were no immediate infusion-related toxicities, and only 1 dose-limiting toxicity potentially related to T-cell infusion was seen. The 2-year overall survival (OS) was 68%. Additionally, patients who received T-cell therapy while in complete remission after allogeneic HSCT had a 78% OS at 2 years. Patients treated for B-cell disease (n = 10) had a 2-year OS of 80%. Patients with T-cell disease had a 2-year OS of 60%, which suggests an improvement compared with published posttransplantation 2-year OS rates of 30% to 50%. Hence, this study shows that donor-derived LMP-Ts are a safe and effective therapy to prevent relapse after transplantation in patients with B cell- or T cell-derived EBV-associated lymphoma or lymphoproliferative disorder and supports the infusion of LMP-Ts as adjuvant therapy to improve outcomes in the posttransplantation setting.

This phase II study explored the efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and safety of BTH1677 combined with bevacizumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients with untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS:Patients were randomized to the BTH1677 arm (N\u2009=\u200961; intravenous [IV] BTH1677, 4\u00a0mg/kg, weekly; IV bevacizumab, 15\u00a0mg/kg, once each 3-week cycle [Q3W]; IV carboplatin, 6\u00a0mg/mL/min Calvert formula area-under-the-curve, Q3W; and IV paclitaxel, 200\u00a0mg/m2, Q3W) or Control arm (N\u2009=\u200931; bevacizumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel as above). Carboplatin/paclitaxel was discontinued after 4-6\u00a0cycles and patients who responded or remained stable received maintenance therapy with BTH1677/bevacizumab (BTH1677 arm) or bevacizumab (Control arm). Efficacy assessments, based on blinded central radiology review, included objective response rate (ORR; primary endpoint), disease control rate, duration of objective response, and progression-free survival. Overall survival and adverse events (AEs) were also assessed. RESULTS:ORR was higher in the BTH1677 vs Control arm but the difference between groups was not statistically significant (60.4% vs 43.5%; P\u2009=\u2009.2096). All other clinical endpoints also favored the BTH1677 arm but none statistically differed between arms. PK was consistent with previous studies. Although a higher incidence of Grade 3/4 AEs occurred in the BTH1677 vs Control arm (93.2% vs 66.7%), no unexpected AEs were observed. Serious AEs and discontinuations due to AEs were lower in the BTH1677 vs Control arm. CONCLUSIONS:Improvements in tumor assessments and survival were observed with BTH1677/bevacizumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel compared with control treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC.

This phase II study explored the efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and safety of BTH1677 combined with bevacizumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients with untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS:Patients were randomized to the BTH1677 arm (N\u2009=\u200961; intravenous [IV] BTH1677, 4\u00a0mg/kg, weekly; IV bevacizumab, 15\u00a0mg/kg, once each 3-week cycle [Q3W]; IV carboplatin, 6\u00a0mg/mL/min Calvert formula area-under-the-curve, Q3W; and IV paclitaxel, 200\u00a0mg/m2, Q3W) or Control arm (N\u2009=\u200931; bevacizumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel as above). Carboplatin/paclitaxel was discontinued after 4-6\u00a0cycles and patients who responded or remained stable received maintenance therapy with BTH1677/bevacizumab (BTH1677 arm) or bevacizumab (Control arm). Efficacy assessments, based on blinded central radiology review, included objective response rate (ORR; primary endpoint), disease control rate, duration of objective response, and progression-free survival. Overall survival and adverse events (AEs) were also assessed. RESULTS:ORR was higher in the BTH1677 vs Control arm but the difference between groups was not statistically significant (60.4% vs 43.5%; P\u2009=\u2009.2096). All other clinical endpoints also favored the BTH1677 arm but none statistically differed between arms. PK was consistent with previous studies. Although a higher incidence of Grade 3/4 AEs occurred in the BTH1677 vs Control arm (93.2% vs 66.7%), no unexpected AEs were observed. Serious AEs and discontinuations due to AEs were lower in the BTH1677 vs Control arm. CONCLUSIONS:Improvements in tumor assessments and survival were observed with BTH1677/bevacizumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel compared with control treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC.

A phase I study of CPI-613 plus cytarabine and mitoxantrone was conducted in patients with relapsed or refractory AML.<b>Results:</b> Exposure to chemotherapy induced mitochondrial oxygen consumption that depended on PDH. CPI-613 sensitized AML cells to chemotherapy indicating that mitochondrial metabolism is a source of resistance. Loss of p53 did not alter response to CPI-613. The phase I study enrolled 67 patients and 62 were evaluable for response. The overall response rate was 50% (26CR+5CRi/62). Median survival was 6.7 months. In patients over 60 years old, the CR/CRi rate was 47% (15/32) with a median survival of 6.9 months. The response rate for patients with poor-risk cytogenetics also was encouraging with 46% (11/24 patients) achieving a CR or CRi. RNA sequencing analysis of a subset of baseline bone marrow samples revealed a gene expression signature consistent with the presence of B cells in the pretreatment marrow of responders.<b>Conclusions:</b> The addition of CPI-613 to chemotherapy is a promising approach in older patients and those with poor-risk cytogenetics. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 24(9); 2060-73. \u00a92018

LSCs employ CXCL12/CXCR4 to home toward protective marrow niches. Heparin disrupts CXCL12-mediated sequestration of cells in the marrow. CX-01 is a low-anticoagulant heparin derivative. In this pilot study, we combined CX-01 with chemotherapy for the treatment of AML. Induction consisted of cytarabine and idarubicin (7 + 3) with CX-01.

Manufacturing, transport, and administration of intravenous, allogeneic bone marrow-derived MSCs in doses from 1 to 4 million MSCs per kg is safe in lung transplant recipients with BOS.

The aim of this study is to build a predictive model based on clinical variables and cytokine gene polymorphism for predicting acute GVHD (aGVHD) and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) from the analysis of a large cohort of HLA-identical sibling donor allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) patients. A total of 25 SNPs in 12 cytokine genes were evaluated in 509 patients. Data were analyzed using a linear regression model and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). The statistical model was constructed by randomly selecting 85% of cases (training set), and the predictive ability was confirmed based on the remaining 15% of cases (test set). Models including clinical and genetic variables (CG-M) predicted severe aGVHD significantly better than models including only clinical variables (C-M) or only genetic variables (G-M). For grades 3-4 aGVHD, the correct classification rates (CCR1) were: 100% for CG-M, 88% for G-M, and 50% for C-M. On the other hand, CG-M and G-M predicted extensive cGVHD better than C-M (CCR1: 80% vs. 66.7%, respectively). A risk score was calculated based on LASSO multivariate analyses. It was able to correctly stratify patients who developed grades 3-4 aGVHD (<i>P</i> < .001) and extensive cGVHD (<i>P</i> < .001).

The aim of this study is to build a predictive model based on clinical variables and cytokine gene polymorphism for predicting acute GVHD (aGVHD) and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) from the analysis of a large cohort of HLA-identical sibling donor allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) patients. A total of 25 SNPs in 12 cytokine genes were evaluated in 509 patients. Data were analyzed using a linear regression model and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). The statistical model was constructed by randomly selecting 85% of cases (training set), and the predictive ability was confirmed based on the remaining 15% of cases (test set). Models including clinical and genetic variables (CG-M) predicted severe aGVHD significantly better than models including only clinical variables (C-M) or only genetic variables (G-M). For grades 3-4 aGVHD, the correct classification rates (CCR1) were: 100% for CG-M, 88% for G-M, and 50% for C-M. On the other hand, CG-M and G-M predicted extensive cGVHD better than C-M (CCR1: 80% vs. 66.7%, respectively). A risk score was calculated based on LASSO multivariate analyses. It was able to correctly stratify patients who developed grades 3-4 aGVHD (<i>P</i> < .001) and extensive cGVHD (<i>P</i> < .001).

circulation. Thus, blood neutrophil counts serve as a measure for the immune system's functionality. Hematological patients often have low neutrophil counts due to disease or chemotherapy. To increase neutrophil counts and thereby preventing infections in high-risk patients, recombinant G-CSF is widely used as adjunct therapy to stimulate the maturation of neutrophils. In addition, G-CSF is utilized to recruit stem cells (SCs) into the peripheral blood of SC donors. Still, the actual functionality of neutrophils resulting from G-CSF treatment remains insufficiently understood. We tested the <i>ex vivo</i> functionality of neutrophils isolated from blood of G-CSF-treated healthy SC donors. We quantified chemotaxis, oxidative burst, and phagocytosis before and after treatment and detected significantly reduced chemotactic activity upon G-CSF treatment.

Thus, blood neutrophil counts serve as a measure for the immune system's functionality. Hematological patients often have low neutrophil counts due to disease or chemotherapy. To increase neutrophil counts and thereby preventing infections in high-risk patients, recombinant G-CSF is widely used as adjunct therapy to stimulate the maturation of neutrophils. In addition, G-CSF is utilized to recruit stem cells (SCs) into the peripheral blood of SC donors. Still, the actual functionality of neutrophils resulting from G-CSF treatment remains insufficiently understood. We tested the <i>ex vivo</i> functionality of neutrophils isolated from blood of G-CSF-treated healthy SC donors. We quantified chemotaxis, oxidative burst, and phagocytosis before and after treatment and detected significantly reduced chemotactic activity upon G-CSF treatment. Similarly, <i>in vitro</i> treatment of previously untreated neutrophils with G-CSF led to reduced chemotactic activity. In addition, we revealed that this effect persists in the allogeneic SC recipients up to 4 weeks after neutrophil engraftment.

The disease-free survival of this group was 10% (0 to 35%) compared with 55% (46% to 64%, P < .001) for those without disease. The \u0394N assay was validated using the post-HSCT specimen by sorting abnormal or suspicious cells to confirm recipient or donor origin by chimerism studies.

The phenotype of the relapse specimen was then used retrospectively to assess the pre-HSCT specimen, allowing identification of additional samples with low levels of MRD involvement that were previously undetected. Quantitative assessment of WT1 gene expression was not predictive of relapse or other outcomes in either pre- or post-transplant specimens. MRD detected by \u0394N was highly specific, but did not identify most relapsing patients.

Patients and Methods Patients with solid tumors were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase. Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis after a single dose (Cycle 0) informed dose escalation using accelerated dose titration. Once one grade 2 toxicity or dose-limiting toxicity was observed in Cycle 1, the accelerated dose titration was terminated and a 3\u2009+\u20093 dose escalation was started. Continuous daily dosing was evaluated along with two intermittent regimens (7\u00a0days on/7\u00a0days off and 3 times per week). In the expansion phase at RP2D, patients with endometrial or prostate cancer, as well as those with select tumor types with a PIK3CA mutation, AKT mutation or PTEN loss, were enrolled. Patients were evaluated for adverse events (AEs), PK parameters, blood glucose and insulin levels, and tumor response. Results The RP2D of GSK2141795 for once-daily dosing is 75\u00a0mg. The most common (>10%) treatment-related AEs included diarrhea, fatigue, vomiting, and decreased appetite. Most AEs were low grade. The frequency of hyperglycemia increased with dose; however, at the RP2D, grade 3 hyperglycemia was only reported in 4% of patients and no grade 4 events were observed. PK characteristics were favorable, with a prolonged half-life and low peak-to-trough ratio. There were two partial responses at the RP2D in patients with either a PIK3CA mutation or PTEN loss.

The most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were bone pain, myalgia, arthralgia, back pain, and elevated white blood cell counts, with similar incidences across groups. All doses of Rolontis were well tolerated, and no new or significant treatment-related toxicities were observed. In Cycle 1, Rolontis demonstrated noninferiority at the 135\u00a0\u03bcg/kg dose and statistical superiority in DSN at the 270\u00a0\u03bcg/kg dose when compared to pegfilgrastim.", "Keywords": ["Breast cancer", "Neutropenia", "Rolontis", "Eflapegrastim"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5943466?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Cancer medicine", "authorinfo": ["Vacirca JL", "Chan A", "Mezei K", "Adoo CS", "P\u00e1pai Z", "McGregor K", "Okera M", "Horv\u00e1th Z", "Landherr L", "Hanslik J", "Hager SJ", "Ibrahim EN", "Rostom M", "Bhat G", "Choi MR", "Reddy G", "Tedesco KL", "Agajanian R", "L\u00e1ng I", "Schwartzberg LS"], "title": "An open-label, dose-ranging study of Rolontis, a novel long-acting myeloid growth factor, in breast cancer."}, "PMC6034645": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "29784643", "source": "MED", "pmid": "29784643", "pmcid": "PMC6034645", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC6034645"}, "doi": "10.1182/blood-2018-04-842880", "title": "The presence of large focal lesions is a strong independent prognostic factor in multiple myeloma.", "authorString": "Rasche L, Angtuaco EJ, Alpe TL, Gershner GH, McDonald JE, Samant RS, Kumar M, Van Hemert R, Epstein J, Deshpande S, Tytarenko R, Yaccoby S, Hillengass J, Thanendrarajan S, Schinke C, van Rhee F, Zangari M, Walker BA, Barlogie B, Morgan GJ, Davies FE, Weinhold N.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Rasche L", "firstName": "Leo", "lastName": "Rasche", "initials": "L", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Myeloma Institute and."}}}, {"fullName": "Angtuaco EJ", "firstName": "Edgardo J", "lastName": "Angtuaco", "initials": "EJ", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Radiology Department, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR;

"abstractText": "Tissue injury and inflammation markedly alter touch perception, making normally innocuous sensations become intensely painful. Although this sensory distortion, known as tactile allodynia, is one of the most common types of pain, the mechanism by which gentle mechanical stimulation becomes unpleasant remains enigmatic. The stretch-gated ion channel PIEZO2 has been shown to mediate light touch, vibration detection, and proprioception. However, the role of this ion channel in nociception and pain has not been resolved. Here, we examined the importance of Piezo2 in the cellular representation of mechanosensation using in vivo imaging in mice. Piezo2-knockout neurons were completely insensitive to gentle dynamic touch but still responded robustly to noxious pinch.

Although this sensory distortion, known as tactile allodynia, is one of the most common types of pain, the mechanism by which gentle mechanical stimulation becomes unpleasant remains enigmatic. The stretch-gated ion channel PIEZO2 has been shown to mediate light touch, vibration detection, and proprioception. However, the role of this ion channel in nociception and pain has not been resolved. Here, we examined the importance of Piezo2 in the cellular representation of mechanosensation using in vivo imaging in mice. Piezo2-knockout neurons were completely insensitive to gentle dynamic touch but still responded robustly to noxious pinch. During inflammation and after injury, Piezo2 remained essential for detection of gentle mechanical stimuli. We hypothesized that loss of PIEZO2 might eliminate tactile allodynia in humans. Our results show that individuals with loss-of-function mutations in PIEZO2 completely failed to develop sensitization and painful reactions to touch after skin inflammation.

stratification, more effective therapy and better supportive care have resulted in survival rates after childhood cancer of around 80% in developed countries. Treatment however can be harsh, and three in every four childhood cancer survivors (CCS) develop at least one late effect, such as gonadal impairment. Gonadal impairment can cause involuntary childlessness, with serious consequences for the well-being of CCS. In addition, early menopause increases the risk of comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. Inter-individual variability in susceptibility to therapy related gonadal impairment suggests a role for genetic variation. Currently, only one candidate gene study investigated genetic determinants in relation to gonadal impairment in female CCS; it yielded one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that was previously linked with the predicted age at menopause in the general population of women, now associated with gonadal impairment in CCS. Additionally, one genome wide association study (GWAS) evaluated an association with premature menopause, but no GWAS has been performed using endocrine measurements for gonadal impairment\u00a0 as the primary outcome in CCS.<h4>Methods</h4>As part of the PanCareLIFE study, the genetic variability of chemotherapy induced gonadal impairment among CCS will be addressed. Gonadal impairment will be determined by anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) levels or alternatively by fertility and reproductive medical history retrieved by questionnaire. Clinical and genetic data from 837 non-brain or non-bilateral gonadal irradiated long-term CCS will result in the largest clinical European cohort assembled for this late-effect study to date. A candidate gene study will examine SNPs that have already been associated with age at natural menopause and DNA maintenance in the general population. In addition, a GWAS will be performed to identify novel allelic variants.

Donor sex and parity are well-established risk factors for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), with male donors typically associated with lower rates of GVHD. Well-matched unrelated donors (URDs) have also been associated with increased risks of GVHD as compared with matched sibling donors. These observations raise the question of whether male URDs would lead to more (or less) favorable transplant outcomes as compared with parous female sibling donors. We used the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research registry to complete a retrospective cohort study in adults with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome, who underwent T-cell replete HCT from these 2 donor types (parous female sibling or male URD) between 2000 and 2012. Primary outcomes included grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD (aGVHD), chronic GVHD (cGVHD), and overall survival. Secondary outcomes included disease-free survival, transplant-related mortality, and relapse. In 2813 recipients, patients receiving male URD transplants (n = 1921) had 1.6 times higher risk of grade 2 to 4 aGVHD (P < .0001). For cGVHD, recipient sex was a significant factor, so donor/recipient pairs were evaluated.

Donor sex and parity are well-established risk factors for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), with male donors typically associated with lower rates of GVHD. Well-matched unrelated donors (URDs) have also been associated with increased risks of GVHD as compared with matched sibling donors. These observations raise the question of whether male URDs would lead to more (or less) favorable transplant outcomes as compared with parous female sibling donors. We used the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research registry to complete a retrospective cohort study in adults with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome, who underwent T-cell replete HCT from these 2 donor types (parous female sibling or male URD) between 2000 and 2012. Primary outcomes included grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD (aGVHD), chronic GVHD (cGVHD), and overall survival. Secondary outcomes included disease-free survival, transplant-related mortality, and relapse. In 2813 recipients, patients receiving male URD transplants (n = 1921) had 1.6 times higher risk of grade 2 to 4 aGVHD (P < .0001). For cGVHD, recipient sex was a significant factor, so donor/recipient pairs were evaluated. Female recipients of male URD grafts had a higher risk of cGVHD than those receiving parous female sibling grafts (relative risk [RR] = 1.43, P < .0001), whereas male recipients had similar rates of cGVHD regardless of donor type (RR = 1.09, P = .23).

Controlling abundance of wildlife species that are simultaneously protected, abundant, competitive for resources, and in conflict with some stakeholders but beloved by others, is a daunting challenge. Free-ranging horses (Equus caballus) present such a conundrum and managers struggle for effective tools for regulating their abundance. Controlling reproduction of female horses presents a potential alternative. During 2009-2017, we determined the long-term effectiveness of GnRH vaccine (GonaCon-Equine) both as a single immunization and subsequent reimmunization on reproduction and side effects in free-ranging horses. At a scheduled management roundup in 2009, we randomly assigned 57 adult mares to either a GonaCon-Equine treatment group (n = 29) or a saline control group (n = 28). In a second roundup in 2013, we administered a booster vaccination to these same mares. We used annual ground observations to estimate foaling proportions, social behaviors, body condition, and injection site reactions. We found this vaccine to be safe for pregnant females and neonates, with no overt deleterious behavioral side effects during the breeding season. The proportion of treated mares that foaled following a single vaccination was lower than that for control mares for the second (P = 0.03) and third (P = 0.08) post-treatment foaling seasons but was similar (P = 0.67) to untreated mares for the fourth season, demonstrating reversibility of the primary vaccine treatment. After two vaccinations, however, the proportion of females giving birth was lower (P <0.001) than that for control mares for three consecutive years and ranged from 0.0-0.16. The only detectable adverse side effect of vaccination was intramuscular swelling at the vaccination site.

Controlling abundance of wildlife species that are simultaneously protected, abundant, competitive for resources, and in conflict with some stakeholders but beloved by others, is a daunting challenge. Free-ranging horses (Equus caballus) present such a conundrum and managers struggle for effective tools for regulating their abundance. Controlling reproduction of female horses presents a potential alternative. During 2009-2017, we determined the long-term effectiveness of GnRH vaccine (GonaCon-Equine) both as a single immunization and subsequent reimmunization on reproduction and side effects in free-ranging horses. At a scheduled management roundup in 2009, we randomly assigned 57 adult mares to either a GonaCon-Equine treatment group (n = 29) or a saline control group (n = 28). In a second roundup in 2013, we administered a booster vaccination to these same mares. We used annual ground observations to estimate foaling proportions, social behaviors, body condition, and injection site reactions. We found this vaccine to be safe for pregnant females and neonates, with no overt deleterious behavioral side effects during the breeding season. The proportion of treated mares that foaled following a single vaccination was lower than that for control mares for the second (P = 0.03) and third (P = 0.08) post-treatment foaling seasons but was similar (P = 0.67) to untreated mares for the fourth season, demonstrating reversibility of the primary vaccine treatment. After two vaccinations, however, the proportion of females giving birth was lower (P <0.001) than that for control mares for three consecutive years and ranged from 0.0-0.16. The only detectable adverse side effect of vaccination was intramuscular swelling at the vaccination site. Regardless of vaccine treatment (primary/secondary), approximately 62% (34/55) of immunized mares revealed a visible reaction at the vaccine injection site. However, none of these mares displayed any evidence of lameness, altered gait or abnormal range of movement throughout the 8 years they were observed in this study.
