report clinical levels of depression during autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) hospitalization. We report preliminary results from a randomized clinical trial investigating the effect of Programmed Environmental Illumination (PEI) of hospital rooms on depression.<h4>Methods</h4>Patients (N\u00a0=\u00a0187) scheduled to receive an ASCT were assessed for eligibility. Those who met study eligibility criteria (n\u00a0=\u00a044) were randomly assigned to one of two PEI conditions involving delivery of either circadian active bright white light (BWL) or circadian inactive dim white light (DWL) throughout the room from 7 to 10\u00a0am daily during hospitalization. Patients completed the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) prior to hospitalization, at days 2 and 7 post-transplant, and on the third day of engraftment.<h4>Results</h4>General linear model analyses revealed no difference between the groups in CES-D total score at baseline (P\u00a0=\u00a00.7859).
