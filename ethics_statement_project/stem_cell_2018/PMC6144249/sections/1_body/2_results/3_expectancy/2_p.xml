<p>The credibility/expectancy scale was administered at baseline for all participants and at day 2 post‐transplant and third day of engraftment (both following patient exposure to conditions) for a subset of the participants. All data were analyzed for differences. There were no significant differences between the BWL and DWL groups at baseline [
