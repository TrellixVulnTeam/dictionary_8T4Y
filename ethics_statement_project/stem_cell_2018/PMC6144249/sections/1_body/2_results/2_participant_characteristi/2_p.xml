 <xref rid="cam41690-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref> summarizes the sample's descriptive demographic and medical data, indicating that most study participants were male (59%), relatively well educated (65% reported a college or graduate degree), upper income (50% reported incomes above $80 000 per year), and either married or in a marriage equivalent (64%). The majority (59%) were Caucasian, and 27% self‐identified as Black or African American. At the time of transplant, the majority of participants (54%) had reached a very good partial response to treatment, were not on depression medications (91%), and were stage I (50%) on the International Staging System (ISS). Using the HCT comorbidity index, 59% had scores at 2 points or below. Importantly, there were no differences between the groups on demographic or medical variables (
