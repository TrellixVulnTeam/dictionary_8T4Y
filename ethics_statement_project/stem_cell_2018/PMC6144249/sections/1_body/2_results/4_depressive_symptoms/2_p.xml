<p>The GLM analysis of the CES‐D total score revealed no significant difference in depressive symptoms between the BWL (n = 23, 
 <italic>M</italic> = 9.26, SD = 7.03) and DWL (n = 21, 
 <italic>M</italic> = 9.86, SD = 7.43) groups at baseline (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.7859). The repeated‐measures LMM indicated that the main effect of time on CES‐D total score was significant [
 <italic>F</italic>(3,110) = 13.35; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001] . Specifically, there was an increase in depressive symptoms for all study participants during transplant hospitalization (Mean Baseline = 9.54; Mean Day 2—Post‐Transplant = 12.09; Mean Day 7—Post‐Transplant = 16.18; Mean Day 14—Engraftment = 18.97). The interaction of the time by treatment condition effect was significant [
 <italic>F</italic>(3,107) = 2.90; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0386], with a medium effect size (ɳ
 <sup>2 </sup>= 0.08). This result means that changes in depression over time differed depending on whether the patient was exposed to either the DWL or BWL condition. A graphical plot of the interaction (Figure 
 <xref rid="cam41690-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) illustrates how the BWL and DWL groups differed in their trajectories of depressive symptoms over the study period. Figure 
 <xref rid="cam41690-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows a greater increase in depressive symptoms for patients in the DWL condition compared to patients in the BWL condition beginning at day 7 post‐transplant and peaking on the third day of engraftment. Additionally, Figure 
 <xref rid="cam41690-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows that the mean levels of depression were below the clinical depression cutoff of 16 on the CES‐D scale in the BWL group at all timepoints, while this was not the case in the DWL group.
