<p>Depressive symptoms were measured using the 20‐item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES‐D).
 <xref rid="cam41690-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref> A cutoff score of 16 or greater identifies individuals at risk for clinical depression. The CES‐D has been shown to be a reliable measure for assessing the number, types, and duration of depressive symptoms across racial, gender, and age categories (Cronbach's alpha ≥0.85). Concurrent validity by clinical and self‐report criteria as well as substantial evidence of construct validity has been demonstrated. The CES‐D was reliable in the present study (Cronbach's alpha = 0.81, N = 44) and has been established as a valid and reliable measure of depression among cancer patients.
