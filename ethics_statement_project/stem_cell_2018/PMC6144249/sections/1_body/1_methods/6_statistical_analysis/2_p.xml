<p>Using an intent‐to‐treat analysis and data from all randomized participants, the BWL condition was compared to a DWL condition. To determine equivalence between the BWL and DWL groups at baseline, a general linear model (GLM) was conducted. For the main analyses, a repeated‐measures linear mixed model (LMM) was used to evaluate change in depressive symptomatology over time using a random intercepts model. This approach makes use of all the data that each patient provided in parameter estimation and significance testing, even if some of the repeated measures are missing.</p>
