<p>Although the present research represented a trial effort to determine the effect size that would guide power considerations in a larger study, we used the results of Redd et al
 <xref rid="cam41690-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> to obtain an estimate of the effect size for the time by treatment condition interaction associated with the depression measure in the present pilot investigation. In the Redd et al
 <xref rid="cam41690-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> study of fatigue in stem cell transplantation survivors, the interaction effect size was 0.98, indicating that a sample size of 60 patients would be sufficient to obtain a good estimate of effect size for power using the data from the present study.
