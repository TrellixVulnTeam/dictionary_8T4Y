<p>Study personnel approached MM patients during their regular clinical visits. Study personnel described the study, obtained signed consent and administered the screening/eligibility measures questionnaires. Participants who qualified for the study were randomized using a block randomization table to either the bright white light (BWL; n

 <italic> </italic>23) or the dim white light comparison group (DWL; n

 <italic> </italic>21) group.
 <xref rid="cam41690-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref> Following randomization, an un‐blinded study coordinator programmed each light fixture to the correct light condition prior to installation. All conditions were concealed from both the patient and the blinded study coordinators who administered the psychological questionnaires and communicated with patients. Patients completed the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES‐D) independently using a study iPad. Exceptions were made for patients experiencing debilitating fatigue, in which case the surveys were administered orally. Blinded coordinators did not enter the hospital rooms while the light fixtures were turned on. Study participants completed CES‐D at four timepoints: baseline, prior to hospitalization, day 2 post‐transplant, day 7 post‐transplant, and the third day (approximately day 14 post‐transplant) of engraftment. Engraftment was defined as the period where the patient's absolute neutrophil count is above 500 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>. After three consecutive days above this value, the patient is considered fully engrafted; this is a marker of successful transplantation required for discharge.
