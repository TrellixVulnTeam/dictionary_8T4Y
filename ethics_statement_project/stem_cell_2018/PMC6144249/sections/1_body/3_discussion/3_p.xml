<p>The BWL and DWL groups differed in both their trajectory and final levels of depressive symptoms during hospitalization. Mean levels of depressive symptoms increased sharply during the first week of hospitalization in both groups, then leveled off in the BWL group but continued to increase in the DWL condition until the third day of engraftment. Mean levels of depression were below the clinical depression cutoff on the CES‚ÄêD scale in the BWL group at all timepoints. However, the DWL group remained above the clinical cutoff beginning at day 7.</p>
