<p>The findings may also have major implications for lighting in hospital rooms. Circadian active ambient light in the hospital room may not only reduce depressive symptoms but also other common symptoms of circadian disruption experienced by hospitalized cancer patients including fatigue and sleep disturbances. Our previous studies have shown that systematic light exposure delivering BWL by light book reduced fatigue and improved sleep efficiency among cancer survivors.
