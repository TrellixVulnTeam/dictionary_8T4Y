<p>The present study examined the effectiveness of Programmed Environmental Illumination (PEI) using freestanding light fixtures in the hospital room delivering circadian active bright white light (BWL) from 7 to 10Â 
 <sc>am</sc> daily to reduce depressive symptoms during ASCT. PEI using BWL reduced the severity of depressive symptoms during hospitalization compared to circadian inactive dim white light (DWL). To our knowledge, this is the first study to show beneficial effects of PEI on depressive symptoms among MM patients undergoing ASCT.
