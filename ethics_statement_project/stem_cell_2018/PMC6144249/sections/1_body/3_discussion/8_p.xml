<p>The results reported here must be interpreted in the context of its limitations. First, the study is preliminary with a relatively small sample size and is based on a larger program of research examining the effects of light to treat cancer‐related fatigue. Second, the results presented here did not include post‐hospitalization assessments of depressive symptoms. It is not yet known if PEI using BWL during hospitalization affects depressive symptoms during the post‐transplant period. Third, the potential mechanisms underlying the effects of BWL on depressive symptoms were not examined; however, our primary hypothesis is that circadian entrainment plays a role.</p>
