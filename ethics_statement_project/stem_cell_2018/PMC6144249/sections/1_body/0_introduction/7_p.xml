 <xref rid="cam41690-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> According to the Rea model, spectral irradiance at the cornea is first converted into circadian light (CL
 <sub>A</sub>) reflecting the spectral sensitivity of the circadian system that is then transformed into a circadian stimulus (CS). The CS value reflects the absolute sensitivity of the circadian system. Thus, CS is a measure of the 
 <italic>effectiveness</italic> of retinal light to stimulate the human circadian system, as measured by acute melatonin suppression, from threshold (CS = 0.1 or 10% melatonin suppression) to saturation (CS = 0.7, or 70% melatonin suppression). It is important to note that CL
 <sub>A</sub> and CS characterize the spectral and absolute sensitivities of light‐induced nocturnal melatonin suppression via the biological clock. CL
 <sub>A</sub> and CS are assumed to characterize the spectral and absolute sensitivities of the entire human circadian system because the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the central link in a wide variety of daily regulatory functions such as hormone production and sleep. For the purpose of this study, it was accepted that the spectral and absolute sensitivities of nocturnal melatonin suppression are similar to those controlling light‐induced changes of circadian timing, or circadian entrainment.
