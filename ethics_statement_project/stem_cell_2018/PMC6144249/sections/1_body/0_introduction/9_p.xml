<p>In the present study, we investigated the use of a novel ambient lighting intervention, Programmed Environmental Illumination (PEI) using freestanding light fixtures that delivered either Bright White Light (BWL) or Dim White Light (DWL) daily during hospitalization. The BWL delivered a CS ≥ 0.30 at the eye between 7 and 10 
 <sc>am</sc> daily during hospitalization. A similar lighting system delivering a CS ≥ 0.30 showed a significant improvement in sleep, mood, and behavior in our field research with Alzheimer's disease patients and other populations.
