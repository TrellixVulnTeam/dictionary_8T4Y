<p>Previous studies have administered bright white light (BWL) in various forms including handheld light boxes that deliver 2500 lux at the eye for 2 hours or 10 000 lux at the eye for 30 minutes to treat both seasonal and nonseasonal depression.

 <xref rid="cam41690-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> The retinal mechanisms underlying circadian phototransduction (ie, how the retina converts light signals into electrical signals for the master clock and regulates circadian rhythms) have recently been elucidated. It is now well established that suppression of melatonin synthesis, a marker of the clock, is maximally sensitive to short‐wavelength light with a peak around 460 nm.
