<p>Disrupted circadian rhythms co‐occur with depression, both of which manifest through insomnia and early morning awakening. Indeed, these are common diagnostic criteria for clinical depression.
 <xref rid="cam41690-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> Sleep propensity rhythms closely associate with endogenous melatonin rhythms, and melatonin acts as both a soporific (sleep‐promoting), and chronobiotic (circadian‐entraining) agent. It is unclear, however, whether depressed individuals exhibit increased or decreased melatonin secretion, with studies supporting both notions.

 <xref rid="cam41690-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> Agomelatine, a widely used antidepressant and structural derivative of melatonin, is a melatonin receptor (MT1 &amp; MT2) agonist as well as a serotonin receptor (5‐HT
 <sub>2c</sub>) antagonist. Whether its antidepressant action can be attributed to a synergistic effect or to one of its receptor interactions independently is unknown.
 <xref rid="cam41690-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> Melatonin's relationship to depressed mood may instead be due to its chronobiotic activity. A healthy endogenous melatonin rhythm may be necessary, but not sufficient, to relieve depression with underlying circadian rhythm disruption. Melatonin, whether endogenous or exogenous, will synchronize the SCN; therefore, it is imperative to control its timing in order to entrain circadian rhythms. This can be accomplished using light therapy.
