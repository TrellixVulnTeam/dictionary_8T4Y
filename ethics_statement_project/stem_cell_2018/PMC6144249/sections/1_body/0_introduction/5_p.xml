<p>An easy to deliver, low‐burden and inexpensive intervention to alleviate depression is light therapy. Light therapy has been extensively used to treat seasonal affective disorder (SAD),

 <xref rid="cam41690-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> One hypothesized mechanism through which light therapy reduces depression involves the promotion of circadian entrainment. Individuals suffering from depression exhibit circadian disruption such as disturbances in the timing of sleep, melatonin, and cortisol rhythms.
