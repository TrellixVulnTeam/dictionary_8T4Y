<p>The present research investigates the impact of delivering circadian active light (CS = 0.3 BWL) from 7 to 10 
 <sc>am</sc> to MM patients during their ASCT hospital stay compared to patients receiving circadian inactive light (CS = 0.1, DWL). We hypothesized that participants exposed to the BWL would experience lower levels of depression during hospitalization than those exposed to the DWL. These analyses are part of a larger program of research examining the effects of PEI in treating cancer‐related fatigue during and following ASCT.
