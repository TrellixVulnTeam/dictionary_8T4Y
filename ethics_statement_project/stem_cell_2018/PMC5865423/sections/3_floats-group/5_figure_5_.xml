  <p>Reconstitution of major lymphocyte subsets in patients who received tocilizumab for GvHD prophylaxis. (A,B). The absolute number of cells per mm
   <sup>3</sup> (i.e., microliter) is shown in panel A, and the percentage of the gated cells is shown in panel B. Data are shown for individual patients together with the median and 25
   <sup>th</sup> and 75
   <sup>th</sup> quartiles (red bars). Gray shading represents the upper and lower range expected for healthy control subjects. Samples were obtained at one month (n=33), three months (n=29), six months (n=22), and 12 months (n=13). Lymphocytes were gated on total CD45
   <sup>+</sup> white blood cells, and all other subsets were gated on lymphocytes. NK: natural killer.
