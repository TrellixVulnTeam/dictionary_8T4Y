  <p>Engraftment, GvHD, disease-free survival, and overall survival. (A). Cumulative incidence of achieving an absolute neutrophil count &gt;500/mm
   <sup>3</sup> for three consecutive days. (B). Cumulative incidence of patients that achieved an unsupported platelet count &gt; 20,000/mm
   <sup>3</sup>. Five patients never dropped their platelet count below 20,000. (C,D). Cumulative incidence of grades II-IV and grades III-IV aGvHD. (E). Cumulative incidence of grades II-IV aGvHD in patients that received myeloablative (MA) 
   <italic>versus</italic> reduced intensity (RIC) preparative regimens. (F). Cumulative incidence of NIH-defined cGvHD. (G) Probability of disease-free survival and (H) overall survival in patients that received Toc/Tac/MTX as GvHD prophylaxis. Dashed gray lines indicate 95% confidence interval bands.
