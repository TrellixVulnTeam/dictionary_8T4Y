<p>Patients were tested by multi-parameter flow cytometry for reconstitution of lymphocytes and major lymphocyte subsets (CD3
 <sup>+</sup>, CD4
 <sup>+</sup>, and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, B cells, and NK cells) at four intervals over the first year (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-1030717">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Patients recovered lymphocyte subsets to, or near, healthy control levels between six months and one year post-transplant, except for NK cells, which recovered early. The percentage of both regulatory T cells (Tregs) and T helper 17 (TH17) cells were within the expected range of healthy donors, and while Treg levels gradually decreased over the post-transplant period, the absolute number of TH17 cells remained stable (

 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S5)</italic>, and a subset analysis revealed other imbalances. Specifically, a functionally immature/transitional CD21
 <sup>−</sup> subset found to be elevated in association with autoimmunity,

 </sup> was increased throughout the assessment period. However, this subset as well as most other abnormalities (including the percentage of antigen inexperienced naïve B cells) recovered through the first year. There were no significant differences seen when comparing patients experiencing aGvHD or cGvHD compared to those who did not experience GvHD for any assessment (
