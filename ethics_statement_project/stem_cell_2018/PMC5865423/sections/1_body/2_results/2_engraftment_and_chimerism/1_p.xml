Twenty-one patients received granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for 1-3 days on days 14-19 post-transplantation to accelerate white blood cell (WBC) recovery. The platelet count in five patients never dropped below 20,000. Two additional patients died before achieving engraftment of platelets. In the remaining patients, the median time to platelet engraftment was 17 days (range: 10-103) (

Median donor CD3 chimerism was 88% (range: 34-100), while median CD33 chimerism was 100% (range: 97-100). Day 100 studies were performed in 27 patients and revealed a median donor CD3 chimerism of 91% (range: 43-100) and CD33 chimerism of 100% (range: 91-100).
