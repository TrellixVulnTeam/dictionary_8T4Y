<p>From the CIBMTR database, four controls were identified for 30 patients, three controls for three patients, and two and one control for one patient each. The baseline characteristics for the patients in the phase 2 trial and the control cohort are detailed in 
 <xref rid="t2-1030717" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Median follow up was 15 months (range: 9-20 months) for patients receiving Toc/Tac/MTX and 13 months (range; 3-72 months) for the control cohort. The incidence of grades II-IV aGvHD at day 180 was significantly lower in the Toc/Tac/MTX cohort when compared to the Tac/MTX control population (17% 
 <italic>versus</italic> 45% at day 180, HR=0.34 [0.17-0.69], 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.003) (

 <italic>versus</italic> 42% at day 180, HR=0.37, [0.21-0.67], 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.001) (

 <italic>versus</italic> the Tac/MTX groups (38% 
 <italic>versus</italic> 45% at 12 months, HR=0.65, [0.37-1.13], 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.13) (
