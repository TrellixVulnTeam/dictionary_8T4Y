<p>To examine how the administration of Toc altered inflammatory cytokine production, we assayed serum cytokine levels (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, tumor necrosis factor α [TNF-α] and interferon g [IFN-g]) and soluble (s)IL-6R levels in the peripheral blood of patients who received Toc (n=35) as well as a control population (n=11) which had the same trial eligibility criteria, but did not receive this agent (see patient demographics in 
 <italic>Online Supplementary Table S2</italic>). In the control population, we observed that IL-6 was the only cytokine that was increased above baseline during the first 28 days (i.e., nine-fold increase on day 14 post-transplantation) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-1030717">Figure 2</xref>). Conversely, sIL-6R levels were significantly decreased on days seven and 14 before rebounding back to baseline on day 28. In the Toc cohort, IL-6 levels were increased in patients who received Toc at days seven, 14, and 28 when compared to baseline (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-1030717">Figure 3A</xref>). Levels were augmented above baseline in both MA and RIC recipients (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-1030717">Figure 3A</xref>), although IL-6 concentrations were higher in patients who received ablative compared to reduced intensity regimens on days seven and 14, but not day 28 (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S2A</italic>). sIL-6R levels were also significantly increased beginning on day seven post-transplantation, and were still elevated by day 28 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-1030717">Figure 3B</xref>). Levels were augmented in recipients of reduced intensity as opposed to MA regimens on day 14, but otherwise there were no differences at other time points (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S2B</italic>). Of the other cytokines measured in the blood, marginal increases were observed in IL-2 at day seven and IL-10 at day 28 (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S3</italic>). A direct comparison of cytokine levels between control and Toc-treated patients demonstrated a marked increase in IL-6 and sIL-6R levels in the latter group at all time points (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-1030717">Figure 4</xref>). There were also significant but very modest decreases in IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10 in these patients.
