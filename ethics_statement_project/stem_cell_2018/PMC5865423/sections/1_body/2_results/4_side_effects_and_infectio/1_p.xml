<p>There were no infusion-related reactions associated with the administration of Toc. The major immediate Toc-associated side effect within the first 28 days post-transplantation was the development of grade III liver toxicity. Nine patients (26%) had ≥ grade III ALT elevations, two patients (6%) had ≥ grade III AST levels and one patient had a grade IV bilirubin elevation. Transaminase elevations typically peaked 7-10 days after infusion, and were transient in all patients, eventually returning to baseline. The marked bilirubin level in one patient was ascribed to total parenteral nutrition administration after a biopsy revealed no evidence of GvHD or any other underlying pathology. No patient developed veno-occlusive disease of the liver. A total of 23 grade III or higher infectious complications were observed in 13 patients during the first 100 days. Fifteen of these were due to bacterial infections, of which 11 were bloodstream (staphylococcus epidermidis [n=6], bacillus cereus [n=1], strep oralis [n=1], strep mitis [n=1], polymicrobial sepsis [n=1], vancomycin-resistant enterococcus [n=1]), two urinary tract (

Other viral infections consisted of human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) encephalitis (n=1), enterovirus (n=1), and BK virus (n=3). One patient developed invasive aspergillus pneumonia.
