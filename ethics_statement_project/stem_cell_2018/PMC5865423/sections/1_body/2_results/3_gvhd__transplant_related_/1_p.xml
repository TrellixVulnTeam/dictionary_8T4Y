<p>The cumulative incidence of grades II-IV aGvHD at days 100 and 180 was 14% (95% CI 5-30%) and 17% (95% CI 7-35%), respectively, (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1030717">Figure 1C</xref>). The incidence of grades III-IV aGvHD at these same time points was 3% (95% CI 0-11%) and 6% (95% CI 1-16), respectively, (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1030717">Figure 1D</xref>). All patients who developed â‰¥ grade II aGvHD within the first 100 days had isolated involvement of the skin or upper GI tract. Three patients had GvHD of the skin, one of whom developed grade IV disease, which proved to be fatal. Three patients had upper GI tract involvement, which was resolved in each case with modest doses of steroids. There were no cases of aGvHD involving the liver or lower GI tract within this time interval. One patient did develop grade II-IV aGvHD involving the lower GI tract between days 100-180 post-transplantation. A second patient with a prior history of overall grade III skin involvement developed upper GI tract disease in the duodenum on day 177. The cumulative incidence of grades II-IV aGvHD for each individual tissue site is shown in 
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S1</italic>. There was no difference in the incidence of grades II-IV aGvHD at day 180 between patients who received MA (17%, 95% CI 4-37) 
 <italic>versus</italic> reduced intensity (18%, 95% CI 4-39) conditioning regimens (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1030717">Figure 1E</xref>). The median time to onset for aGvHD in recipients of MA 
 <italic>versus</italic> reduced intensity transplants was 44 and 78 days, respectively. The incidence of cGvHD at 12 months was 38% (95% CI 21-55) in this patient population (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1030717">Figure 1F</xref>). The median follow up for surviving patients was 15 months. TRM was 14% (95% CI 5-28) at 12 months and was attributable to GvHD (n=3), sepsis (n=1), aspergillus pneumonia (n=1), idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (n=1), and respiratory failure (n=1). The one-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 29% (95% CI 15-44). DFS and OS at 12 months was 57% (95% CI 42-70) and 68% (95% CI 53-79), respectively, (
