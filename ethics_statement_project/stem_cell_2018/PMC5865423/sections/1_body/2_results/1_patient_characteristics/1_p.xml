<p>From January 29, 2015 to June 30, 2016, 35 patients were enrolled in the study. The demographic data for this population is detailed in 
 <xref rid="t1-1030717" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The median age of the cohort was 66 (range: 22-76). Diseases consisted of 
 <italic>de novo</italic> acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n=14), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; n=4), secondary or therapy-related AML (n=5), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n=3), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML; n=5), myelofibrosis (n=1), T-cell lymphoma (n=1), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; n=1), and natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma (n=1). The disease status of patients with acute and chronic leukemia are further specified in 
 <xref rid="t1-1030717" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Four of the 14 patients with AML in first remission had FLT3/ITD mutations, two additional recipients had evidence of minimal residual disease at the time of transplant, and another patient had a monosomal karyotype. All three patients with ALL in complete remission 1 (CR1) were Philadelphia chromosome positive. Using the adjusted disease risk index,
