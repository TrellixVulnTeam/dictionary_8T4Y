 <italic>versus</italic>-host disease (GvHD) is the major complication arising from allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). GvHD is characterized by the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines that induce target organ damage directly, or indirectly by activating other effector cell populations.

 </sup> Interleukin 6 (IL-6) has emerged as an inflammatory cytokine that plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of GvHD and has become a potential therapeutic target.

 </sup> Preclinical studies have demonstrated that IL-6 levels are increased early during GvHD and are present in all target tissues.

 </sup> Moreover, blockade of the IL-6 signaling pathway using an antibody that binds to the IL-6 receptor has been shown to reduce the severity of GvHD and prolong survival in pre-clinical murine models.

 </sup> In particular, IL-6 appears to have an important pathophysiological role in promoting inflammation in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract,
