<p>In the study herein, we sought to determine whether the addition of Toc to standard immune suppression was effective for the prevention of aGvHD in patients who received busulfan (Bu)-based conditioning regimens, with particular emphasis given to the lower GI tract given prior pre-clinical studies and the primacy of this organ in GvHD pathophysiology. To place our results in context, we interrogated the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) database to obtain a control population that was matched for relevant demographic and transplant characteristics. We also examined longitudinal immune reconstitution and inflammatory cytokine production as additional parameters by which to assess the effect of IL-6 inhibition in transplant recipients.</p>
