 </sup> Eligibility criteria for the control cohort consisted of having received a first allogeneic transplant at an American center, excluding The Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), and meeting the same eligibility as the study population, with the exception of receiving only tacrolimus (Tac)/methotrexate (MTX) as GvHD prophylaxis. Controls were selected from the years 2010-2015. This selection process resulted in the screening of 1,442 patients to define an optimally-matched control cohort.
