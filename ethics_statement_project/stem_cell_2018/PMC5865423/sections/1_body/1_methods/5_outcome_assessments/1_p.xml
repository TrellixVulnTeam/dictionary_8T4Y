<p>Neutrophil recovery was defined as the first of three consecutive days with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC)&gt;500. Platelet engraftment was defined as the first day of a sustained platelet count above 20,000 without any platelet transfusions for the preceding seven days. Five patients who received reduced intensity transplants never dropped their platelet count below 20,000. In these patients, the date of platelet recovery was defined as the first day that the platelet count increased after its nadir. The grade of aGvHD was determined using the Glucksberg scale.
