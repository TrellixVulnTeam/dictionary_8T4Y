<p>The primary objective of this study was to compare the probability of grades II-IV aGvHD-free survival at day 180 post-transplant between recipients of Toc, Tac and MTX and a contemporary control population who received Tac/MTX-based GvHD prophylaxis. Pre-specified secondary objectives of the study were to compare chronic (c)GvHD, transplant related mortality (TRM), disease relapse or progression, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) between Toc/Tac/MTX and Tac/MTX CIBMTR controls. 
 <italic>Online Supplementary Table S1</italic> contains the definition of the events, censorings, and competing risks for all time-to-event outcomes. Additionally, secondary objectives included description of the incidence of grades â‰¥3 toxicities according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTACAE) v4, neutrophil and platelet engraftment, characterization of infections, proportion of donor chimerism, extent of immune reconstitution, and production of proinflammatory cytokines among patients who received Toc/Tac/MTX. A population that consisted of patients who were otherwise eligible for the trial but did not receive Toc in addition to Tac/MTX for GvHD prophylaxis was employed as a control for the cytokine analysis. These patients were consented and enrolled on a separate study. Both protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the MCW.
