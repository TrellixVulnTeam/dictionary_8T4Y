 </sup> While a number of inflammatory molecules are produced as a consequence of the conditioning regimen and the activation and expansion of alloreactive donor T cells, IL-6 has emerged as an important cytokine mediator of tissue damage.

 </sup> In the study herein, we demonstrate that inhibition of IL-6 signaling by the administration of Toc in addition to standard immune suppression resulted in a significant reduction in grades II-IV aGvHD and an increase in grades II-IV aGvHD-free survival, when compared to a matched control population. The administration of Toc was also observed to be safe when given in the setting of MA or reduced intensity Bu-based conditioning regimens. Moreover, adverse events were largely confined to transient elevations in transaminase values, and infectious complications were not dissimilar to what we have previously observed in this patient population treated with standard immune suppression only.
