<p>The results of the current study extend those reported by Kennedy and colleagues,

 </sup> who also examined the efficacy of Toc for the prevention of aGvHD. These investigators observed an incidence of grades II-IV and III-IV aGvHD at day 100 of 12% and 3%, respectively, which was similar to what we observed (14% and 3% for these same endpoints). There were, however, several important differences between the two studies, which suggest that the results may be more broadly generalizable to allogeneic HSCT recipients. First of all, the median age of patients in our report was substantially higher (66 
 <italic>versus</italic> 48), indicating that Toc administration appears to have activity in older patients who comprise an increasing percentage of the transplant population.

 </sup> Secondly, patients in the current report received Bu-based conditioning regimens, whereas those in the study by Kennedy 
 <italic>et al</italic>. were treated with either total body irradiation and Cy (MA conditioning) or Flu and melphalan (RIC). Since the intensity of the conditioning regimen affects the degree of inflammatory cytokine production

 </sup> and incidence of aGvHD,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="b30-1030717" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
 </sup> the fact that promising results were observed in patients who received different MA and reduced intensity regimens is evidence that inhibition of IL-6 may have activity across a spectrum of preparative regimens. Finally, we were able to provide additional context to our data by demonstrating a reduced incidence of grades II-IV aGvHD as well as an increase in grades II-IV GvHD-free survival when compared to a matched control population that only received Tac/MTX.
