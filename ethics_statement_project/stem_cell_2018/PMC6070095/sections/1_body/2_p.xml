<p>Although CRS can be successfully managed with IL-6â€“directed therapy (eg, tocilizumab) or corticosteroids, the clinical presentations of CRS and sepsis are often indistinguishable. Thus, concomitant infection and CRS pose both diagnostic and management challenges and can be fatal [

However, little is known about the frequency and types of infectious complications after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy and whether current antimicrobial prophylactic practices are sufficient. Furthermore, patients are at increased risk of prolonged B-cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinemia after CD19-targeted therapy, but the late infectious complications after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy remain unknown. To this end, we examined infections occurring within the first 180 days in 53 adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL treated with CD19-targeted 19-28z CAR T cells in a phase I clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC).
