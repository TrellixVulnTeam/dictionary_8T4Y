<p>We then analyzed various pre- and posttreatment clinical factors to examine their association with increased infectious risk. Whereas age, sex, prior lines of chemotherapy, prior allogeneic HSCT, cyclophosphamide dose, conditioning regimen (cyclophosphamide alone vs cyclophosphamide plus fludarabine), disease burden, CAR T-cell dose, and hypogammaglobulinemia did not correlate with risk of infection in univariate analysis, CRS (grade ≥3) was associated with increased risk of subsequent infection, particularly BSI (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The association between grade ≥3 CRS and infection (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.67; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .05) or BSI (adjusted HR, 19.97; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) remained significant in multivariate analysis. Cumulative incidence curves of time to infection and BSI within 180 days after CTI stratified by CRS grades are shown in
