<p>To examine whether serum cytokine profiles differ in patients with CRS and infection, we first identified serum cytokines correlated with grades of CRS: interferon γ, IL-6, interleukin 10 and 15, and tumor necrosis factor α (

Considering the timing of infections by organism type, bacterial infections occurred a median of 18 days (IQR, 9–29) after CTI, followed by fungal infections (median 23 days; IQR, 20–29 days) and viral infections (median 48 days; IQR, 20–80 days).
