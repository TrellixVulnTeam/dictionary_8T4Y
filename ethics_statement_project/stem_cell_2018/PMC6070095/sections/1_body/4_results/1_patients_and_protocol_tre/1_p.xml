<p>Fifty-three patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL received CD19 CAR T cells during the study period. Detailed patient and laboratory characteristics are listed in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The median age was 45 years (interquartile range [IQR], 30–74 years); 39 (74%) were men, and the majority (43; 81%) were white. The study patients were pretreated with a median of 3 prior lines of chemotherapy (IQR, 2–7) before CTI, and 19 patients (36%) underwent a prior allogeneic HSCT. Per protocol, all received conditioning chemotherapy, either cyclophosphamide alone (n = 42; 79%), cyclophosphamide plus fludarabine (n = 10; 19%), or cyclophosphamide plus clofarabine (n = 1; 2%).
