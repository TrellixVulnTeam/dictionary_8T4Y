<p>An episode of infection was defined as the presence of clinical symptoms along with corroborating laboratory, radiographic, microbiologic, and histopathologic results (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref>) [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9â€“16</xref>]. Proven or probable invasive fungal infections (IFIs) were defined according to published criteria [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. IFIs in which symptom onset occurred before CTI were excluded. A timeline of documented infections occurring between the day of CTI (day 0) and day 180 was constructed for each patient. Data were censored on receipt of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), last MSKCC follow-up date, or death.
