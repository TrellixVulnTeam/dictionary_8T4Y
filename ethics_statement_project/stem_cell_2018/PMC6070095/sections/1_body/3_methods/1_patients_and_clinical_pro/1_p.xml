<p>We reviewed 53 consecutive adults with relapsed or refractory B-ALL who received 19-28z CAR T cells at MSKCC in a phase I clinical trial (NCT01044069) from May 2010 until August 2016 when the study was completed. This historical cohort study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board at MSKCC. Details regarding the study design were described elsewhere [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. All patients underwent disease assessment with bone marrow evaluations immediately before CTI. The study included 3 stages designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 doses of CAR T cells (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>/kg and 3 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>/kg) and the addition of fludarabine to the conditioning chemotherapy regimen. Antimicrobial prophylaxis commenced with chemotherapy and was continued until count recovery or need to switch to therapy per institutional guidelines.
