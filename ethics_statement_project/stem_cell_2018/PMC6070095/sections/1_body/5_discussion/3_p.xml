<p>We found that the presence of grade ≥3 CRS was the only factor independently associated with any infection, and in particular BSI. It is unclear whether tocilizumab or corticosteroids used to treat high-grade CRS increases the risk of infection independent of CRS, but we were not able to find a significant association in univariate analysis (data not shown). Notably, a similar finding of an association between CRS and infection was recently reported in another trial of CD19-targeted CAR T cells, but with a different costimulatory domain (41BB vs CD28 in our study) and in patients with ALL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma [

 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3–7</xref>] and preclinical studies have demonstrated that tonic CAR signaling may induce early exhaustion of T cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], there is currently no evidence to suggest that these T cells lead to immune dysfunction.
