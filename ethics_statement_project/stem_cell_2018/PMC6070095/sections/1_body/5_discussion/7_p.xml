<p>The decision regarding choice of antifungal prophylaxis depends on several factors, including local epidemiology, drug interactions, and adverse effect profile. At MSKCC, there were 4 breakthrough IFIs (9.5%) among 42 patients receiving antifungal prophylaxis. The majority of patients (32 of 42; 76%) received micafungin prophylaxis (100 mg intravenously daily). Compared with posaconazole suspension, micafungin was associated with a lower rate of premature discontinuation from gastrointestinal intolerance or adverse effects in patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome in a single-center, randomized, open-label study [
