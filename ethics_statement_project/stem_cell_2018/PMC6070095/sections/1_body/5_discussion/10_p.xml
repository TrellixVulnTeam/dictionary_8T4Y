<p>In summary, infections are common in adults with relapsed B-ALL after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy and can co-occur during times of CRS, although infection-related deaths were low. Based on our observations of the frequency and timing of infections, antimicrobial prophylaxis probably will parallel that for high-risk neutropenic patients although local bacterial and fungal epidemiology should be considered. As we gain experience with the different CAR constructs in various hematologic cancers, further studies should be conducted so we can better understand acute and delayed infectious complications in order to develop optimal prophylactic and management strategies and improve clinical outcomes in patients with various hematologic cancers receiving CD19 CAR T cells.</p>
