<p>Our study highlights the frequency, type, and severity of infectious complications in patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL during the first 6 months after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. Overall, 22 patients (42%) experienced ≥1 infection, predominantly bacterial, within the first 30 days of CTI; 10 (31%) of 32 patients with complete remission experienced ≥1 infection, many due to respiratory virus, between days 31 and 180. The infection-related mortality rate was low in these heavily treated patients, with deaths occurring in cases of either a multidrug-resistant organism (n = 1) or polymicrobial infection (n = 2).</p>
