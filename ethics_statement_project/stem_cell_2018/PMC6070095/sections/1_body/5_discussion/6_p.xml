<p>We also observed that bacterial infections occurred a median of 18 days after CTI, followed by fungal infections at a median of 23 days. The early occurrence of bacterial infections, followed by fungal infections, mirrors that in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT or high-risk patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy [

 <italic>C. difficile</italic> infections were excluded, we found that 7 of the 13 remaining documented bacterial infections diagnosed within the first 30 days after CTI were due to resistant organisms. These included 3 VRE, 2 ESBL-producing 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 1 multidrug-resistant 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and 1 carbapenemase-producing 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> infection. All study patients had previously experienced â‰¥2 lines of chemotherapy for B-ALL, and 19 patients (36%) had also undergone prior allogeneic HSCT. We can thus infer that these patients had significant antimicrobial exposure before CAR T-cell therapy. Although prior antimicrobial exposure is a well-known risk factor for colonization by resistant organisms, it is difficult to know to what degree it contributed in this study cohort [
