<p>Consequently, the fundamental objectives of this investigation were: 1) to determine the duration, effectiveness, and reversibility of both a single immunization and subsequent reimmunization against GnRH in suppressing reproductive rates of free-ranging mares in a natural environment, 2) to determine the safety and adverse side effects (if any) in free-ranging mares including assessment of general health, body condition, effects on current pregnancy, injection site reactions, and neonatal health and survival and, 3) to compare the effects of a single vaccination against GnRH on time budgets and social behaviors [

 <sub>1:</sub>) that a single vaccination against GnRH would suppress fertility for multiple years with decreasing effectiveness over time but would not result in permanent infertility. Furthermore, we surmised (H
 <sub>2:</sub>) that the anamnestic immune response to revaccination would be more effective and longer lasting in suppressing fertility than the initial immunization alone. Moreover, we reasoned (H
 <sub>3:</sub>) that except for localized inflammatory reactions at the injection site, we would not observe other adverse side effects (i.e. lameness, detrimental effects on existing pregnancy, neonatal health and survival, body condition, behavioral changes). Apart from determination of return to normal fertility of treated mares, these objectives and hypotheses were addressed and accomplished in this investigation.
