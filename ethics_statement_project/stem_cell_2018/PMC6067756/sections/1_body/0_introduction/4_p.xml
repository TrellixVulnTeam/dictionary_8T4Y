<p>A promising immunological approach to contraception in feral horses and other wild ungulate species involves immunization against gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH), a small neuropeptide that performs an obligatory role in mammalian reproduction [
 <xref rid="pone.0201570.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. When conjugated to a highly immunogenic carrier protein and combined with a potent adjuvant, GnRH vaccination actively stimulates a persistent immune response resulting in prolonged antibody production against endogenous GnRH. These antibodies induce transient infertility by binding to GnRH, thus preventing attachment to receptors on pituitary gonadotropes, suppression of gonadotropin release, and ultimately ovulation in females [
