<p>The GnRH-based contraceptive agent known as GonaCon-Equine (National Wildlife Research Center, Fort Collins, CO, USA; [
 <xref rid="pone.0201570.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] is registered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as a restricted-use pesticide for contraception of adult female feral horses and burros. A single immunization with this or earlier versions of this vaccine (more generally referred to as GonaCon) have been shown to induce extended infertility (≥ 2 yr) in numerous wild ungulate species including captive and free-ranging elk (

 <xref rid="pone.0201570.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, multiple years of infertility are only experienced in a fraction of vaccinated animals. In free-ranging elk, for example, there was approximately a 90% treatment effect the first year after vaccination but this declined to 50% by the second year; with no measurable effect by year three [
