<p>While documentation of contraceptive efficacy and side effects of GonaCon have been described for a variety of wild ungulates, similar evidence for feral horses is limited. To our knowledge, only two long-term (â‰¥ 3 years) empirical investigations have been conducted using GonaCon-Equine. These include a clinical trial with captive feral mares [

 <xref rid="pone.0201570.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In the study with free-ranging horses, vaccination significantly reduced foaling rates of treated females, however, effectiveness was inconsistent over time and was substantially lower than that reported for captive feral mares treated with the same vaccine [
 <xref rid="pone.0201570.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Furthermore, neither of these studies integrated revaccination as a strategy to increase vaccine efficacy. Lastly, these inquiries provide little quantitative evidence of the reversibility of the effects of this vaccine, the presence or absence of adverse side effects related to inoculation of pregnant mares, and neither examined the potential for increased side effects with reimmunization.
