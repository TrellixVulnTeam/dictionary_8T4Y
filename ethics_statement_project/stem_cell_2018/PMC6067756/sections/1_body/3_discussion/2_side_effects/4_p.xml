<p>Researchers have generally hypothesized that by alleviating the energetic demands of gestation and lactation, contracepted females will attain improved body condition over pregnant females that require additional food resources to produce and rear an offspring. However, for free-ranging large ungulates, empirical evidence supporting [

 <xref rid="pone.0201570.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] this prediction is limited and equivocal. In this investigation, contracepted mares that experienced no gestation and lactation did not exhibit improved body condition over mares that successfully reproduced. Individual mares in each experimental group, attained an average BCS of 5.0 (moderate) or better, which has been reported to be the minimally optimal level of stored fat necessary to achieve maximum reproductive efficiency during pregnancy and lactation [
