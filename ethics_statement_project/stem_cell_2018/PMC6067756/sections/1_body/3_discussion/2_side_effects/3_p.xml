<p>Other techniques for reducing the fertility of free-ranging species, such as vaccination with the native porcine zona pellucida vaccine (PZP) and tubal ligation, maintain the competency of the endocrine aspects of fertility. This can lead to unintended consequences with repeated estrous cycling in polyestrous species. In fact, in a population of white-tailed deer, where most reproductive females had received tubal ligations, fawning was negligible; however, there was more than a 700% increase in the number mature males attracted to the area occupied by a high number of estrous cycling females [

GonaCon-Equine may avoid these inadvertent consequences by functionally inducing mimicry of pregnancy in females which continues to be an important part of the social structure of the group but does not invite intense adverse breeding behaviors.
