<p>The only detectable adverse side effect of vaccination was intramuscular swelling at the vaccination site. Mares treated with GonaCon-Equine consistently showed evidence of inflammatory reactions at the injection site. While we never observed lameness associated with this reaction, several mares revealed draining abscesses within one-year post-vaccination. This is consistent with results for other wild ungulates treated with the same or similar GonaCon vaccines [

Given the designed highly inflammatory nature of both the adjuvant, which contains killed mycobacteria and non-biodegradable oil, as well as, the foreign protein carrier molecule, these types of reactions are predictable. In fact, they are likely necessary for optimum vaccine efficacy [

It is impossible to assess the total impact of these lesions on animal welfare; however, in this investigation, these did not have a measurable effect on body condition, locomotion, or social behaviors. Therefore, until additional research suggests otherwise, we conclude that the presence of injection site lesions following GonCon vaccination do not pose a serious contraindication associated with the application of this vaccine, and there appear to be minimal long-term effects on individual animal welfare.
