<p>We acknowledge that our sampling intensity and/or sensitivity of our ocular index to body condition may not have enabled us to detect fine-scale differences between experimental groups. However, we conducted these evaluations during time periods when differences in body condition between pregnant and non-pregnant (GonaCon-treated) females should have been the greatest. Namely, during early spring (March) when fats deposits are depleted over winter and during Aprilâ€“August when the energetic demands of late gestation and lactation are increasing.</p>
