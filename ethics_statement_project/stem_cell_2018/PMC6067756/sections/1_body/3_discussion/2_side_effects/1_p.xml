<p>After revaccinated in October 2013, time budget and social behaviors of mares in spring/summer of 2014 were comparable to those observed during the same period in 2010, following the initial treatment in October 2009. We found no evidence of differences in frequency or intensity of social behaviors including estrous behavior associated with treatment. Both treatment and control groups displayed few estrus behaviors in either 2010 [

Behaviors associated with estrus were observed only 17 times in treated and 57 times in control mares out of 1148 observed social behavior events. This supports our earlier findings that pregnant mares rarely show overt estrous-related behaviors and similarly GonaCon-Equine treated mares only occasionally display these behaviors, although each for different reasons. Once a mare is pregnant, progesterone likely subverts much of the estrous type behavior that would generally be displayed with high estrogen levels, and only occasionally do domestic horses display and stand for mounting when pregnant [
 <xref rid="pone.0201570.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Relatively small amounts of estrogen are secreted as follicles develop and then regress. In the absence of progesterone, relatively small amounts of estrogen are likely sufficient to induce erratic estrous behavior as was observed in these mares. However, the small amounts of estrogen were likely insufficient to induce an LH surge and subsequent ovulation.
