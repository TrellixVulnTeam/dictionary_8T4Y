<p>Regardless of the underlying endocrinology associated with these behaviors, vaccinated and control mares both displayed social interactions that maintained herd structure; herding, tending, and defending behaviors from the stallion; and social hierarchies. The only meaningful factor that influenced the amount of time spent in social behaviors (e.g. allo-grooming, herding and tending) was the presence or absence of a foal. Mares with foals spent more time alone with the foal than those without off-spring, which is to be expected given their social and nutrient requirements during the neonatal and post-natal periods [
