<p>The body condition of an animal is dependent on a balance between energy intake and expenditure. When intake is not sufficient to meet energy requirements for various activities (i.e. maintenance, growth, activity, gestation, lactation, etc.), fat reserves and eventually lean body tissue will be lost. The fact that pregnant and lactating mares in this study were in similar body condition to that of contracepted ones suggest that food is unlikely a limiting factor for free-ranging horses at THRO. This is primarily due to the conservative management of multiple species of ungulates and their food resources [
