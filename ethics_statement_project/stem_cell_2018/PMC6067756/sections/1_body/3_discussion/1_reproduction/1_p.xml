<p>This study demonstrated that a single vaccination against GnRH, using GonaCon-Equine, administered during mid-gestation, was safe, initiated short duration (2 yrs.) infertility in some mares, and was reversible, but was minimally effective in reducing fertility of treated females compared to controls. For two foaling seasons following vaccine treatment, we observed statistically significant reductions (28â€“38%) in foaling proportions of treated versus control mares but no effect by the third-year post-treatment, thus confirming the reversibility of the vaccine.</p>
