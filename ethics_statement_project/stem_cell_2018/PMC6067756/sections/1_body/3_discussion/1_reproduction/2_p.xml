<p>These results parallel similar findings from other experimental evaluations of GonaCon-Equine reported for captive and free-ranging mares. In a comparable study in Nevada with feral horses in a natural environment, GonaCon-Equine reduced foaling proportions by an average of 33% over a 3-year period but, like our study, contraception was only modestly effective over this period [

 <xref rid="pone.0201570.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although these investigations did not suggest a definitive causation for these differences, they all pointed to suppressed and less persistent GnRH antibody concentrations in free-ranging ungulates compared to their captive counterparts suggesting a relatively compromised or weakened immune response to the vaccine that resulted in reduced contraceptive effectiveness.
