<p>It is fundamental knowledge that a secondary response to a vaccine generally results in a more rapid production of antibodies that are produced in greater amounts and over a longer time compared to the primary vaccination [

 <xref rid="pone.0201570.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], GonaCon-Equine is formulated by combining a non-biodegradable oil in water-based emulsion and an optimum concentration of immunostimulatory killed mycobacteria to form a depot usually deep in muscle tissue. This depot injection is thought to allow for a slow release and prolonged stimulation so that the formulation can act for much longer periods of time (years) than is possible with standard injections (months). This effect is thought to be responsible for the extended antibody response of 3â€“4 years in vaccinated deer [
