<p>In comparison to a single inoculation with GonaCon-Equine, the effect of reimmunization on foaling proportions was highly significant which allowed clear differentiation between treated and control mares for multiple breeding seasons. Compared to a single vaccination, reimmunization of mares in this study resulted in a much higher (58%) average vaccine effectiveness (range = 0.80–0.94) than the single vaccination for a 3-year period (2015–2017). Likewise, this level of effectiveness following reimmunization was on average higher than that previously reported for free-ranging mares treated with a single application with GonaCon-Equine [

 <xref rid="pone.0201570.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These results support the conclusion that a booster immunization with GonaCon-Equine can provide a highly effective, multi-year suppression of fertility in free-ranging horses and these results may be consistent in other animal species, as well.
