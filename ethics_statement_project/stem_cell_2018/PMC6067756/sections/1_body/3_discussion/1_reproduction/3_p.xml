<p>It is widely acknowledged that differences in vaccine effectiveness can be attributed to increased environmental stressors (i.e., nutritional status, injuries, parasite load, pathogen exposure, and social dynamics) that can inhibit a more vigorous immune response in free-ranging animals in a natural environment [

 <xref rid="pone.0201570.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. It follows that while efficacy trials with captive animals can provide an important first approximation of vaccine safety and performance under controlled conditions; they may offer only limited inference to free-ranging animals that are not buffered against natural stressors that may decrease immune response and vaccine effectiveness. Regardless of the factor(s) contributing to the limited effectiveness of GonaCon in free-ranging animals, it appears that the immune response from a single vaccination does not consistently provide multiple years of infertility in all or even a high proportion of these animals.
