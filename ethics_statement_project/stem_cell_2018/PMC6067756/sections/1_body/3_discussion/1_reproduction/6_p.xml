<p>While this response was not unexpected, the magnitude and duration of effectiveness of GonaCon-Equine following revaccination, even 4 years after the initial vaccination, is salient and relevant to the management of fertility in free-ranging horses. First, it demonstrates that a booster vaccination can stimulate a highly effective immune response that can result in multiple years (â‰¥ 3 yrs.) of contraception. Second, it provides an initial reference point for defining the optimum revaccination schedule required for long-term reproductive management of female horses in a natural environment. And finally, it supports the consideration that while a single application may be preferred from a practical management perspective, GonaCon-Equine is more effective, in free-ranging horses, if repeat vaccinations are delivered on a periodic basis. While initial results are encouraging, additional research is needed to complete the objectives of this study including: 1) to define the duration of effective contraception post-revaccination, 2) to determine if long-term or permanent infertility is a possible outcome, and 3) to assess if return to fertility (if it occurs) results in altered birth phenology of treated mares. We will investigate these questions over the next three years of this study. Additionally, there may be a more optimal revaccination schedule which allows for altered duration of effectiveness or is more conducive to management schedules.</p>
