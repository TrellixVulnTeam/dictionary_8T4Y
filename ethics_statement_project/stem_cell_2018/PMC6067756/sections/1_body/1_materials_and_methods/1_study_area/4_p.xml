<p>The social structure of this population consists of 14–16 social groups (bands) that include a single dominant stallion, subdominant stallions, and 1–5 adult mares, yearlings, and foals of both sexes. Males greater than 1 year of age that have not acquired a band are usually found in ephemeral bachelor groups of 3–6 individuals. These bands are non-territorial and are spatially distributed across the South Unit primarily east of the Little Missouri River. All horses are known by unique coloration and markings and have been previously identified and assigned individual identifiers by managers. Photographs of each animal from birth to adulthood assist in the identification of individuals. Age, reproductive history, and genealogy data for each animal has been maintained since 1993.</p>
