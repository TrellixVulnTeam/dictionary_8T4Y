<p>In spring/summer 2009, we collected pre-treatment data on all mares and bands within THRO. The purpose of this effort was: 1) to determine the sample size and sampling intensity required to achieve acceptable statistical power (≥ 80%) to detect fixed differences (≥ 50%) in foaling proportions of experimental groups, 2) to assess unknown logistical limitations of locating and identifying specific study mares within bands of horses, and 3) to train field technicians to observation protocols, and collect pre-treatment time budget and social behavioral data.</p>
