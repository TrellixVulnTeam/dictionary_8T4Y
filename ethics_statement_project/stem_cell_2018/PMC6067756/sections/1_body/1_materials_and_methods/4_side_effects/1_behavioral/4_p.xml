<p>We observed all horses from the nearest distance that did not elicit attention to the presence of the observer, typically 50–200 m. All observations were conducted using a 15–45 × 600 mm spotting scope or 10 × 42 mm binoculars when the distance between horses and observers was too far to allow unassisted detailed observation. We observed each band of horses weekly or bi-weekly in conjunction with other field assessments.</p>
