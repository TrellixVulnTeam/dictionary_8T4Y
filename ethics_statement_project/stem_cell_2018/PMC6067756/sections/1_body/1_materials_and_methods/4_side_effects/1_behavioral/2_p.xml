 <xref rid="pone.0201570.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Briefly, this included blocking observations into three daylight time periods (08:00–12:00 h, 12:01–16:00 h, and 16:01–20:00 h) with observations conducted during the primary breeding season, 1 March– 1 August 2014. Each observation session included collection of a 20-min instantaneous scan sample of time budgets at 1 min intervals for each adult band member (≥1 year old), and all-occurrence data collection for social interactions [
