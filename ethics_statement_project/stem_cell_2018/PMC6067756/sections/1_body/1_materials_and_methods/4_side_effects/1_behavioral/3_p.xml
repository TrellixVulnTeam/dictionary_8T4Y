 <xref rid="pone.0201570.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Social behavior data included herding, reproduction, agonism, harem-tending, and harem-social behavior, and were collected at all occurrences throughout the observation sessions. Harem-social behavior was not collected through all-occurrence sampling in our previous study; however, it was collected during the scan sample in the previous study and was worthy of further consideration here. We defined this category as interactions between two individuals that did not meet the definition of the other all-occurrence behaviors (e.g. allogrooming and non-reproductive olfactory investigation).
