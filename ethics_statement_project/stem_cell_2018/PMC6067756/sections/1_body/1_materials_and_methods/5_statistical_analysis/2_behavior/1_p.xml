<p>We used the same statistical approach for the analyses in 2014 as that used in 2010 [
 <xref rid="pone.0201570.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We modeled the frequency of each behavior using mixed-effects linear regression, where individual female identity and sampling time (time of day) were included as random effects on the intercept term of each model. This accounted for variation that may have been present among individuals who were sampled repeatedly, though not always equally over time, and for temporal variation in behavior when samples were not equally collected across all times of the day. Time budget behaviors sampled at 1-min intervals were aggregated into proportion of time spent per behavior to calculate an independent measure of behavior per observation session. We used the 
 <italic>lme4</italic> package of R version 3.1.2 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing 2014) and SYSTAT 12.02.00 (SYSTAT Software, Inc. 2007) to calculate descriptive statistics and obtain mixed-effects model estimates using restricted maximum likelihood [
 <xref rid="pone.0201570.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Separate models were fitted for each time budget behavior with the fixed effects of treatment group (treated or control), foal presence (dependent foal &lt; 1 year of age present with the female, or no foal present with the female), female age, and band size. In the previous study, we considered band fidelity (number of times a female moved bands within a year), but data were too homogeneous to consider that factor in 2014: only 8 horses moved bands at all (4 treated/4 saline) and five of those moved collectively to a different stallion.
