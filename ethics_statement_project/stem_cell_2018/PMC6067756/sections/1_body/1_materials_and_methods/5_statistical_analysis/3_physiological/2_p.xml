<p>This research was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the National Park Service (NPS) (Permit Numbers: MWR_THRO_Baker_Horse_2013.A3, MWR_THRO_Baker_Horse_2015.A3) and Colorado State University (IACUC Protocol No. 17-7651A). This study was conducted in accordance with good laboratory practices (GLP) and oversight from United States Department of Agriculture/National Wildlife Research Center (No.QA1647). All data collections were conducted after obtaining a scientific collection permit issued by Theodore Roosevelt National Park (THRO-2010-SCI-0010). All work, other than animal handling and vaccination at the two feral horse roundups, was observational. Every effort was made to prevent and minimize disruption of natural band dynamics and individual horse behavior and well-being during handling and treatment application.</p>
