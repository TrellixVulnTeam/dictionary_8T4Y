<p>During a scheduled management roundup at THRO (18–23 October 2009), 160 horses were guided by helicopter into permanent corrals and handling facilities. An attempt was made to capture the entire population to maximize sample sizes for this research project and to remove excess horses to meet desired herd management objectives. A total of 57 adult mares (2–17 years of age) and associated foals, and band stallions, were captured, identified, treated, and retained in the Park for this experiment. Using a randomized complete block design, we established two experimental groups consisting of a GonaCon-Equine treatment group (
 <italic>n</italic> = 29) and a saline control group (
 <italic>n</italic> = 28). Mares were paired (blocked) based on age and pregnancy status such that animals within a block were as similar as possible. Within each block, individual mares were then randomly assigned to either a control or treatment group.
