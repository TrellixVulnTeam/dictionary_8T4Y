<p>Equine veterinarians and a reproductive specialist, blinded to treatment status, assessed the general health, body condition, pregnancy status, and approximate gestational stage of each mare. We determined pregnancy status and gestational age by transrectal palpation and ultrasonography of the reproductive tract [

 <sup>0</sup> C. We later transferred frozen serum on dry ice to Fort Collins, Colorado, where it was stored at -80
 <sup>0</sup> C. We also assessed serum for exposure to common pathogens known to cause abortions in horses (e.g. equine herpesvirus-1, equine infectious anemia, equine viral arteritis and contagious equine metritis) that could confound the interpretation of treatment-induced infertility [
