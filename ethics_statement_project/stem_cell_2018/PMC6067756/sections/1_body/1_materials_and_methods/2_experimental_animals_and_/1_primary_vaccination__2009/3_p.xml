<p>We applied treatments while mares were restrained in a squeeze chute. Females in the treatment group received an intramuscular injection in the lower left gluteal musculature, by hand-held syringe (18-gauge, 3.8 cm needle) containing GonaCon-Equine (2.0 mg GnRH conjugate + adjuvant; 2.0 mL). The vaccine contained multiple synthetic copies of GnRH coupled to a large immunogenic carrier protein (Blue Carrier; Biosonda, Santiago, Chile) that was combined with a water-in-oil adjuvant containing killed

We chose to inject the vaccine into the gluteus muscle (~ 15 cm distal to the point of the hip) rather than the neck because of greater safety for hand-injection, enhanced detection of potential injection site reactions under field conditions, and the preferred location for potential remote dart delivery of the vaccine.
