<p>Four years later, during 23–25 September 2013, we similarly rounded up the entire THRO horse population and moved and handled them through existing corrals and chute systems to remove excess animals from the Park. Given this unique opportunity and endorsement from the Park, we retained all available mares previously immunized and control mares, retreated them, assessed pregnancy status, and determined body condition using techniques identical to those applied at the 2009 roundup. Two mares in the control group and 4 mares in the treatment group died between 2009–2013 and therefore, were not available for this experiment. We attributed these mortalities to malnutrition, dystocia, broken appendage, and unknown causes not related to treatments. The one exception in our 2013 protocol was that we injected the booster vaccination into the opposite (right) hip from where the primary (left hip) vaccination was previously administered. This provided the opportunity to simultaneously evaluate injection site reactions related to both immunizations. Treatment mares again received 2.0 mL GonaCon-Equine and control mares 2.0 mL saline.</p>
