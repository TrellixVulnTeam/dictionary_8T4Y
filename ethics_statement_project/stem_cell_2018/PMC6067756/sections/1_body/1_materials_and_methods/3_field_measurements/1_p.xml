<p>Using 2â€“3 trained technicians and occasional equally trained volunteers, we conducted field measurements and observations consistently from year to year. Prior to field observations, technicians were provided with photographic images of individual horses and required to recognize them by band association, natural markings, and pelage coloration. They were also trained or had previous experience in identifying prepartum characteristics of pregnancy (e.g., enlarged abdomen, mammary gland development, waxing teats, behavior, etc.), as well as, body condition scoring, and the appearance and classification of injection site reactions to the vaccine. We collected all data from ground surveys (foot, vehicle, horseback) using binoculars and spotting scopes. Although technicians were unaware of treatment assignments of individual mares, the presence of injection site reactions in several GonaCon-treated mares could have revealed their treatment designation.</p>
