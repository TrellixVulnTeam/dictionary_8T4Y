<p>We predicted that pregnant females inoculated with GnRH at the fall gathers of 2009 and 2013 would give birth to a healthy foal the following spring (2010 or 2014) and presumably be infertile during subsequent breeding seasons. Thus, the effects of the primary or booster vaccinations on reproduction (foaling proportions) would not be observed until the 2011 and 2015 foaling seasons, respectively. These are the first breeding seasons that a treatment or retreatment effect on mare fertility could be detected when using foaling observations to assess successful contraception by the vaccine.</p>
