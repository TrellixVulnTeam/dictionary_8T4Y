<p>At the scheduled gather in October 2013, we extended our evaluation of GonaCon-Equine by assessing the effects of revaccination on fertility and safety in these same experimental mares treated four years after the primary vaccination. Evidence of similar fertility for individual mares was demonstrated at the 2013 gather, where pregnancy proportions of treated (0.92 (23/25), 95% CI = 0.75–0.98) and control (0.88 (23/26), 95% CI = 0.71–0.96) mares were similar (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.86) [

Except for one treated and one control mare, all others had conceived and given birth to at least one foal during 2009–2013. For the 2013 foaling season, foaling proportions of treated (0.69 (18/26), 95% CI = 0.51–0.87) and control (0.66 (18/27) 95% CI = 0.49–0.84) mares were not different (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.84) providing additional evidence that treatments groups were of equal fertility prior to reimmunization (
