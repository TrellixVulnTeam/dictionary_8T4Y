<p>Unlike results from the single vaccination trial, we observed, not only highly significant reduction in foaling proportions between treated and control mares following reimmunization but also a remarkably effective contraceptive response. Except for the first foaling season following treatment application, (2014) in which the vaccine was not expected to have an effect (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.75), foaling proportions in reimmunized mares were lower (
 <italic>P &lt;</italic>0.001) than that for control mares for all subsequent years (2015–2017) (

This was particularly evident for the second post-treatment foaling season (2015) when none 0.00 (0/25), 95% CI = 0.0) of the reimmunized mares produced a foal while the proportion of control mares foaling was estimated to be 0.84 (21/25, 95% CI = 0.69–0.98). During the third post-treatment foaling season (2016), four treated mares produced a foal resulting in a foaling proportion of 0.16 (4/25), 95% CI = 0.01–0.30) while the proportion of control mares foaling was identical to that observed in 2015 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201570.g001">Fig 1</xref>). These foals were determined to be vigorous and in good to excellent condition at birth, however, two of these foals, born in September, were not observed the following spring and were categorized as post-natal mortalities and presumed to have died during winter (2016/2017).
