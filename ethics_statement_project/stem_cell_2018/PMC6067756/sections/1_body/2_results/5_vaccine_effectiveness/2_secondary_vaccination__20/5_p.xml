<p>In 2017, no additional treated mares produced a foal or showed evidence of pregnancy. However, one of the treated mares that had foaled in 2016 died of apparent natural causes (age-related malnutrition) during 2017 and two other revaccinated mares that had foaled in 2016 failed to produce a foal that year resulting in a foaling proportion of 0.041 (1/24), 95% CI = 0.03–0.12) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201570.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The foaling proportion for mares in the control group (2017) was 0.84 (21/25, 95% CI = 0.69–0.98) and higher (
 <italic>P &lt;</italic>0.001) than that for GonaCon-treated mares (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201570.g001">Fig 1</xref>). It should be noted that the apparent decrease in foaling proportions in GonaCon-treated mares from 2016–2017 and resulting increase in vaccine effectiveness (
 <xref rid="pone.0201570.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) is likely due to the inherent error associated with the small sample size (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) of mares in this treatment group that regained fertility. Overall, there was both a substantial decrease in foaling proportions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201570.g001">Fig 1</xref>) and an exceedingly high level of effectiveness (
 <xref rid="pone.0201570.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) for treated mares compared to controls for 3 years post-revaccination (2015–2017) (P &lt;0.001). Thus, fertility measurements during 2015–2017 support our prediction (
