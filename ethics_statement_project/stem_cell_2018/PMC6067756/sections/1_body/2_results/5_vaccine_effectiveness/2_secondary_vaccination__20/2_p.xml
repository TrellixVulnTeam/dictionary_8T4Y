<p>Like 2010, mean foaling proportions during the first post-treatment foaling season (2014) were not different (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.74) between treated (0.60 (15/25), 95% CI = 0.41–0.79) and control (0.56 (15/27), 95% CI = 0.37–0.74) mares (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201570.g001">Fig 1</xref>) supporting similar observations in 2010 that revaccination could be applied to pregnant mares, during mid-gestation, without risk to the existing pregnancy. Foaling date distribution was comparable to that observed in 2010 following the primary vaccination. Average foaling date for treated mares was estimated to be 27 April (95% CI = 5 April– 20 May) and 19 April (95% CI = 6 April– 2 May) for controls. No foal was observed for 15 mares (8 treated: 7 control) that were determined to be pregnant at the 2013 gather. Like 2010 estimates, foaling proportions underestimated pregnancy proportions determined at the 2013 gather for both treated and control mares by approximately 30% and 34%, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201570.g001">Fig 1</xref>). These data, together with similar observations in 2010, support the inference that foaling proportions are not an accurate proxy for pregnancy proportions but provide a limited but practicable field measurement for determining contraceptive effectiveness. Average foal age at first observation across both treatment and control groups was 2.6 (95% CI = 1.5–3.3) days. Nearly all foals born to revaccinated and control mares were classified as vigorous and found to be in good to excellent condition when first observed.
