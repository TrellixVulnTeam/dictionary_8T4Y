<p>Mean foaling proportions of treated (0.62 (18/29) 95% CI = 0.44–0.79) and control (0.68 (19/28) 95% CI = 0.50–0.85) mares during the 2009 pre-treatment foaling season were not different (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201570.s001">S1 Table</xref>]. Further evidence was provided by individual mares at the 2009 gather and primary vaccine inoculation. The proportion of treated (0.86 (25/29), 95% CI = 0.71–0.95 and control (0.85 (24/28), 95% CI = 0.70–0.95) mares determined to be pregnant, via transrectal ultrasonography, were not different (

This provided an opportunity to compare the effects of GonaCon-Equine vaccination on the existing pregnancy of treated mares and neonatal health and survival to that of untreated control mares. Foaling proportions of treated (0.68 (19/28) 95% CI = 0.50–0.85) and control (0.64 (18/28), 95% CI = 0.46–0.82) mares during 2010 were not different (
 <italic>P =</italic> 0.78) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201570.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Births occurred from early March to early September with 97% (35/36) observed during the first four months of the foaling season (1 March to 1 June). Average foaling dates in 2010 for treated and control mares were 5 May (95% CI = 22 April–18 May) and 10 May (95% CI = 25 April–25 May), respectively. No foal was detected for 12 mares (6 treated: 6 control) that were determined to be pregnant at the 2009 gather. None of these mares showed evidence of pregnancy during the intensive foaling period or for the remainder of the year. We surmised that most of these foals were either aborted or died as neonates between the periods from 20 October 2009 (gather) to 1 March 2010 (beginning of foaling observations). Regardless of timing or cause of death, the proportion of mares that foaled in 2010 underestimated the proportion of mares that were determined to be pregnant at the 2009 gather by 24% for treated mares and 21% for control mares.
