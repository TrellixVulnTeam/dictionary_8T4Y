<p>Estimated age of all foals at first observation was 2.4 days (95% CI = 1.7–3.1days). Most neonates (97%), from both experimental groups, were classified as vigorous and in good to excellent condition when first observed. Neonatal survival rate from parturition to 14 days of age was estimated to be 0.95 (18/19, 95% CI = 0.75–0.99) for foals born to GonaCon-treated females and 0.88 (16/18, 95% CI = 0.64–0.98) for foals born to control mares (
