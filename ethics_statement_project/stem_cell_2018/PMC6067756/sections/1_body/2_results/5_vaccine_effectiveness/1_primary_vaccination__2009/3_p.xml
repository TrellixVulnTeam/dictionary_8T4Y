Even though we observed a significant reduction in foaling proportions between treated and control mares during 2011 and a declining effect in 2012, therapeutic effectiveness and relative risk reduction estimates were low to modest and estimated to be 0.37 (95% CI = 0.01–0.60) and 0.28 (95% CI = -0.06–0.51), respectively (
