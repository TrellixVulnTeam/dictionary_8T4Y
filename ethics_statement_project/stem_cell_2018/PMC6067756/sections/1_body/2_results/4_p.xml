<p>We met our sampling objective by observing more than 95% of all mares weekly (and sometimes more often) from 1 March to 1 August each year of the study. It is possible that some foals were born and died without being detected but given the intensity of the sampling observations, we feel that this was highly unlikely. Observations during the remainder of the year and following winter were less intense and more opportunistic depending upon available personnel, weather, and road conditions. During this time, mortality of foals was more likely to have gone undetected.</p>
