<p>Variance among individuals had little influence on any of the behaviors modeled (
 <xref rid="pone.0201570.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Variance was also minimal between time periods of observation; however, there were some significant differences in amount of activity by time of day. An estimated 6.88% (95% C I = -0.73–14.5) more feeding occurred in the 1601–2000 h time-period than did earlier in the day, and this was reciprocated by an estimated 3.33% (95% CI = 1.09–7.79) less resting, 0.34% (95% CI = 0.15–0.82) less maintenance, and 1.30% (95% CI = 0.51–3.11) less social behavior during the same period.
