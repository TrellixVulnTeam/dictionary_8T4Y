<p>We collected behavioral data on 73 feral horses (22 males, 25 treated females, 26 saline females) for 218.3 h in 2014. The median age of observed stallions was 12 years (range = 9–19 years), median age of observed control females was 8 years (range = 7–20), median age of observed treated females was 9 years (range = 7–22), and median band size was 8 horses (range = 2–14). There were no differences detected between treatment groups in any time budget behavior category (
 <xref rid="pone.0201570.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). As band size increased, feeding decreased 1.24% (95% CI = 0.48–2.00) per additional horse in the band. Likewise, locomotion increased 0.20% (95% CI = 0.07–0.33) and maintenance decreased 0.10% (95% CI = 0.01–0.19) per additional horse in the band.
