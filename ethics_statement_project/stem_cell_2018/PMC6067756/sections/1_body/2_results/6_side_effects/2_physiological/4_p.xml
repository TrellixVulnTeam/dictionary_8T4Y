<p>While body condition varied between individuals and study years, it did not vary between treatment groups (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.14) over the course of the study. Likewise, there was no effect of presence of a foal on body condition (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.16). Average body condition ranged from 3.7–4.9 (moderately thin to moderate body condition) for all study animals over the 8 years that mares were observed. Individual body condition scores ranged from 1–7.
