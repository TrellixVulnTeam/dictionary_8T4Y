<p>Like initial vaccination reactions, during the first-year post-revaccination, approximately 50% (13/26) of mares continued to show swelling on the left hip at the site of the 2009 injection and 50% developed a reaction on the right hip at the site of revaccination in 2013. Two of these new reactions were draining abscesses. Yet again, injection site reactions were persistent with approximately half of the mares with swellings at one or both injection sites, 3 years after revaccination. None of the GonaCon-treated mares displayed any evidence of lameness, altered gait or abnormal range of movement throughout the 8 years they were observed.</p>
