<p>Transrectal ultrasonography revealed that the fetuses of most pregnant females were approximately 120+ days old at the roundup and that most had descended over the pelvic rim preventing a more accurate assessment of gestational age at treatment application [
 <xref rid="pone.0201570.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. To provide a more precise estimate, we used an estimated gestation period for horses of 342 days [
 <xref rid="pone.0201570.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and the approximate foaling date (± 5 days) of each mare in 2010 and 2014 and then back-calculated to the date of treatment application at the 2009 (18–23 October) and 2013 (23–25 September) roundups. Using these calculations, we estimated mean gestational age at vaccine inoculation in 2009 to be 162 days (95% CI = 150–175) for treated mares and 154 days (95% CI = 138–170 days) for control mares. For 2013, we used the same calculation and projected that, on average, females were reimmunized against GnRH at approximately 129 days (95% CI = 105–151 days) of gestation and saline-treated control mares at 132 days (95% CI = 119–144 days).
