<p>Following the 2009 and 2013 roundups and release, experimental mares distributed themselves among 16–19 individual bands. At least one treated or control mare was present in all bands during 2010–2017. Likewise, the composition of adult mares in each band, as well as the band stallions, remained relatively stable during this period. By the end of the 2017 foaling season, 14% (4/29) of treated mares and 11% (3/28) of control mares had died of various causes (e.g., malnutrition, broken appendage, dystocia, unknown causes). Except for these mares and one vaccinated mare that was not re-captured at the 2013 gather, all others were observed for foaling and other field measurements for all eight years of this investigation.</p>
