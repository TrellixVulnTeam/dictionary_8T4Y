  <title>Comparative probability of foaling and pregnancy for treatment and control groups of free-ranging feral horses (
   <italic>Equus caballus)</italic> mares selected for this experiment.
  </title>
  <p>Mares were treated with a primary vaccination of GonaCon-Equine in October 2009 and then reimmunized with the same vaccine in September 2013 at scheduled gathers at Theodore Roosevelt National Park, North Dakota, USA. GonaCon vaccinations occurred at the time points represented by the red arrows. Symbols correspond to observed p-values for relative risk comparisons between treatment groups within years (p-value between 0.05 and 0.1 = +, for &lt; 0.05 = x, and for &lt; 1x10
   <sup>-05</sup> = *).
