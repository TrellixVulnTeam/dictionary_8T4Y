 <sup>+</sup>. Aliquots of anti-coagulated whole blood (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA]) were incubated with fluorophore-conjugated monoclonal antibodies: anti-CD3 V450 (clone UCHT1, BD Biosciences), anti-CD4 APC-H7 (clone RPA-T4, BD Biosciences), anti-CD8 Pacific-Orange (clone RPA-T8, Biolegend), anti-CD25 PE-Cy7 (clone M-A251, BD Biosciences), anti-CD127 PE-Cy5 (clone eBioRDR5, eBioscience) for T-cell subsets; anti-CD56 PE (clone B159, BD Biosciences), anti-CD3 V450 (clone UCHT1, BD Biosciences) for NK/NKT cells, and anti-CD19 APC (clone HIB19, BD Biosciences) for B cells. RBC lysis with BD Pharm Lyse was performed either prior to or following incubation with conjugated antibodies. Flow cytometry analysis utilized FACSCanto II (BD Bioscience) or the Fortessa (BD Bioscience) and FACSDiva software (BD Bioscience). There was a change in the use of flow cytometry machines over the course of the study. Both flow cytometers were validated and results were comparable.
