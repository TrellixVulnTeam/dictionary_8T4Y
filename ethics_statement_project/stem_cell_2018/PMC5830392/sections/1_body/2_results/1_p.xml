 <italic>Patient and transplant variables</italic>: one hundred and forty-two subjects enrolled and 138 randomized subjects were evaluable per the protocol-specified mITT criteria (four cancelled study participation before receiving transplantation conditioning: two due to acute infection (one with subsequent disease relapse), one due to provider preference to continue protocol-excluded medications, and another due to disease relapse at transplantation admission) (

 <italic>P</italic>=0.01). Subjects had a median age of 64 years (range: 24–75), varying diagnoses (53 acute myeloid leukemia [AML], 33 myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS], 20 non-Hodgkin lymphoma [NHL], 11 chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL], etc.) and disease-risk indices (low 14, intermediate 96, high/very high 28). They received T-replete 8/8 MUD (n=98) or 7/8 MMD (n=40) PBSC grafts. Median follow up in survivors was 30 months (range: 14–46).
