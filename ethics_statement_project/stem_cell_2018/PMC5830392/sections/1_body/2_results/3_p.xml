<p>Acute GvHD: The primary endpoint of grade II-IV aGvHD incidence rate by day +180 did not differ significantly between treatment arms, at 32.6% (A)

For seven patients, grade II-IV aGvHD occurred after hematologic malignancy relapse (six after early IS taper, and 1 after donor lymphocyte infusions [DLI]). Four of these (B, 1; C, 3) had aGvHD onset prior to day +180, and are included in the primary endpoint. This result was consistent with the result from multivariable analysis: subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) was 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42–1.78, 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.7) for arm B 
 <italic>vs</italic>. arm A, and 0.68 (95% CI 0.33–1.4,
