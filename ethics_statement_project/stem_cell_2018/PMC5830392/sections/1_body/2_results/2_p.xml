 <italic>Engraftment, chimerism, safety</italic>: the median time to neutrophil (&gt;500/μl) and platelet engraftment (&gt;20,000/μl) among patients who experienced count nadir (i.e., neutrophil count &lt;500/vl and/or platelet count &lt;20,000/μl) was 11 days (range: 2–45) and 19 days (range: 10–57), respectively, with no significant difference between treatment arms (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.9 and 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.55 for neutrophils and platelets, respectively). For the entire cohort, 31% of patients did not experience count nadir (24% in arm A, 27% in arm B, 43% in arm C, 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.11) and no subject failed neutrophil engraftment. Median total nucleated cell donor chimerism by day 30 was 96% (range: 42–100) and by day 100 was 97% (range: 0–100, with no significant difference between treatment arms (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.84 and 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.83, respectively). The bort-based regimens were well tolerated. No bort doses were delayed or reduced due to toxicity. No serious adverse event (SAE) attributable to bort (e.g., neuropathy) was documented. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade ≥3 organ dysfunction (hepatic, renal, pulmonary) did not differ significantly between treatment arms, including the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI, 8.7% overall), thrombotic microangiopathy/hemolytic-uremic syndrome (TMA/HUS, 6.5% overall) or hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD, 3.3% overall) (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.14, 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.16 and 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.41, respectively).
