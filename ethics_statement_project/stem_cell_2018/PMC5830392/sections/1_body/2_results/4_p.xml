<p>In an exploratory analysis in line with our protocol stratification, we repeated the analysis by HLA match status (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Table S1A</italic>). For the 8/8 HLA-matched recipients, when all grade II-IV aGvHD were counted, the six-month cumulative incidence was 33% (A) 
 <italic>vs</italic>. 16% (B, 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.1 for arm A 
 <italic>vs</italic>. B) 
 <italic>vs</italic>. 19% (C, 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.21 for arm A 
 <italic>vs</italic>. C) (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S1</italic>). When arms B and C were combined, the six-month cumulative incidence was 17% (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.08 for arm A 
 <italic>vs</italic>. arm B or C). When we repeated the analysis after excluding aGvHD that occurred after relapse and IS taper, the six-month cumulative incidence was 33% (A) 
 <italic>vs</italic>. 13% (B, 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.046 for arm A 
 <italic>vs</italic>. B) 
 <italic>vs</italic>. 16% (C, 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.13 for arm A 
 <italic>vs</italic>. C). When arms B and C were combined, the cumulative incidence was 15% (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.03 for arm A 
 <italic>vs</italic>. arm B or C). However, for 7/8 MMD recipients such a benefit was not appreciable (albeit with limited sample size) (
