<p>We additionally conducted a phase II randomized control trial (RCT) for patients lacking 8/8 HLA-matched sibling donors (DFCI 12â€“404), directly randomizing conventional tac/mtx 
 <italic>vs</italic>. two novel bort-based GvHD prophylaxis regimens, whose mature results we report herein. The regimens comprised bort plus tac/mtx (arm B), directly based on our phase I/II data; and bort plus sirolimus (sir)/tac (arm C), to explore the tolerizing effects of enhanced Treg sparing with combined proteasome- and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-inhibition during early immune reconstitution.

 </sup> We chose bort/sir/tac instead of bort-based calcineurin inhibitors (CNI)-free prophylaxis (e.g., bort/sir/mycophenolate mofetil [MMF]) as the sir/MMF doublet has limited clinical efficacy,

 </sup> and in our experience, adding bort to sir/MMF did not provide adequate efficacy in GvHD prevention, while the sir/tac doublet has documented efficacy comparable to conventional tac/mtx.
