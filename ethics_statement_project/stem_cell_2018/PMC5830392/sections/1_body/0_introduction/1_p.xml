<p>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is curative in advanced or aggressive hematologic malignancies despite associated toxicities. While a sibling matched at human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 is optimal, only a minority of patients who may benefit from HSCT have such a donor available.
