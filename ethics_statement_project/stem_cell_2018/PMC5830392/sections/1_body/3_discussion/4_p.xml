<p>Engraftment was rapid and sustained, with robust donor chimerism by day 30 that was sustained and comparable across treatment arms. The addition of bort alone did not appear to impair immunologic recovery, with similar counts of T cells (CD4, CD8), B cells and NK cells in the conventional tac/mtx 
 <italic>vs</italic>. bort/tac/mtx arms. Count recovery for arm C (bort/sir/tac) was lower, as we previously documented for other sir-based cohorts.

 </sup> As hypothesized, there was relative sparing of Treg reconstitution with arm C (bort/sir/tac), with no impairment of Treg count recovery and elevated Treg:Tcon ratios.
