<p>The clinical impact of these systematic immunologic differences, however, remains unclear. Importantly, the 2-year NRM incidence was low (ranging from 6.4% to 16%) and did not differ significantly between treatment arms. Relapse was in the expected range after RIC HSCT (ranging from 24% to 36%), and did not differ significantly between treatment arms. In this study, survival, while not differing significantly between treatment arms, with 2-year OS ranging from 61% to 62% (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.98), appeared better than anticipated for 7/8 and 8/8 HLA-matched recipients, plateauing at 50% and 66%, respectively, in contrast to 1- and 3-year registry benchmark survivals recently reported for 7/8 and 8/8 donor recipients, of 48%
