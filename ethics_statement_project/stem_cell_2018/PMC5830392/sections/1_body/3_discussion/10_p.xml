<p>In summary, mature data from this open-label 1:1:1 three-arm phase II RCT indicates that the bort-based regimens evaluated appear to provide lower than anticipated grade II-IV aGvHD benefit compared to conventional tac/mtx in T-replete PBSC RIC HSCT. While we note the potential benefit of bort for 8/8 HLA-matched transplants, direct phase III prospective randomization is required in order to confirm such a benefit. Overall, however, the lack of benefit for other transplantation outcomes (NRM, relapse, chronic GvHD, and survival) suggests limited utility for bort prophylaxis in the doses and combinations assessed. Alternative proteasome inhibitor combination regimens (e.g., with PTCy) should also be considered.</p>
