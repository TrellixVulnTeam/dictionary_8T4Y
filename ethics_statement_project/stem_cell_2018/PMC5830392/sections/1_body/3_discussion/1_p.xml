<p>Most adult hematologic malignancy patients who may benefit from allogeneic HSCT lack an available sibling donor and are considered for a MUD or 1-locus MMD, with umbilical cord blood (UCB) and haploidentical (haplo) donors being additional alternative options. Regarding 8/8 MUD, as a result of improvements in DNA-based typing and supportive care, survival outcomes are considered similar to those of MRD HSCT,

 </sup> The use of 1-locus MMD adds risk. A large registry analysis of 2,588 patients with acute leukemias, MDS or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) undergoing RIC HSCT compared 7/8 with 8/8 HLA-matched donors, and documented higher rates of grade II-IV aGvHD and NRM, and lower 3-year OS (30% 
 <italic>vs</italic>. 38%, respectively; 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.01) with a mismatched graft.

 </sup> Novel regimens to improve GvHD outcomes for patients lacking a preferred sibling donor would represent a major advance, and is the focus of our efforts.
