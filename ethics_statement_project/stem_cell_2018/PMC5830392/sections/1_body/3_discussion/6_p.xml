<p>In the context of delayed T-cell reconstitution noted for arm C, this suggests that the combination of a CNI (tac) plus mTOR inhibitor (sir) provides IS without long term tolerizing effects. While it is possible that longer duration of tac/sir immunosuppression in arm C beyond day +180 may have better prevented aGvHD, ultimately, aGvHD deferral rather than long-term amelioration remains a possibility. In subgroup analysis for the 8/8 HLA-matched recipients, bort-based regimens had a borderline trend towards grade II-IV aGvHD benefit 
 <italic>vs</italic>. tac/mtx, with a cumulative incidence of 17% 
 <italic>vs</italic>. 33%, respectively, (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.08). However, grade III-IV severe aGvHD rates were not improved, and for 7/8 MMD grafts a similar trend for aGvHD benefit of bort-based regimens was not appreciable, though sample size was limited.
