<p>Our primary finding is that, as tested, bort-based regimens did not appear to provide additional benefit for grade II-IV aGvHD prevention in T-replete PBSC RIC HSCT, failing to meet the protocol-specified 25% reduction in aGvHD incidence for success. Our phase II RCT requirements for success were stringent, which limits our ability to detect lower, albeit potentially clinically meaningful benefit with bort. However, it is also notable that conventional tac/mtx outcomes were better than anticipated, a finding similar to that recently reported in other contemporary randomized HSCT trials.
