<p>In our study, Bort, limited to three doses peritransplantation (day +1, +4 and +7), did not add toxicity. No bort doses were missed or modified. No subjects developed toxicities of prolonged/delayed bort administration (e.g., neuropathy, colonic necrosis). Comparing treatment arms, no increase in hepatic VOD, AKI or TMA/HUS was noted for bort-based regimens
