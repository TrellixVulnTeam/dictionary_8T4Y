<p>These data highlight the inadequacy of non-randomized comparators for evaluating early phase single arm interventional studies, and document, as an updated standard, the improved MMD and MUD RIC HSCT outcomes achievable with conventional tac/mtx in this study (2-year OS of 58% and 62%, respectively). In the future, prospective trials of alternative donors (e.g., UCB, haplo) and novel GvHD prophylaxis regimens (e.g., maraviroc, PTCy) may need to benchmark these outcomes. In contrast, the bar for the novel GRFS endpoint appears far lower, ranging from 8% to 12% in our study, with no significant difference between treatment arms (
