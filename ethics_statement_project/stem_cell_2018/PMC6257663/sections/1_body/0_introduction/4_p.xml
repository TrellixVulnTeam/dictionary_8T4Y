<p>Topical sodium nitrite, providing nitrite anions, is a vasodilator in vivo by generating nitric oxide (NO) in tissues with lower oxygen tension and pH.

 </sup> This mechanism involves human hemoglobin and myoglobin as oxygen and pH dependent nitrite reductases, and sodium nitrite as the substrate for NO generation. When applied topically to the wound, sodium nitrite produces NO locally and promotes vasodilation. Additionally, NO may aid wound healing by stimulating extracellular matrix production, immune response modulation, and keratinocyte proliferation.

 </sup> We applied topical sodium nitrite to sickle leg ulcers in a phase I safety trial, and previously reported the primary outcome of wound healing after sodium nitrite application.
