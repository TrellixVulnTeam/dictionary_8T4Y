<p>Sickle leg ulcers may negatively impact MCS scores as well. The presence of ulceration in the ≤35 years subgroup was associated with lower MCS scores (40.7 ± 6.9), which were below an accepted threshold of clinical depression (MCS = 42). Similarly, a sickle cell referral center in France examined a small cohort of patients with sickle leg ulcers and observed depression or mood changes in 85% of subjects.

 </sup> We hypothesized younger patients with ulcers may have felt more alienated from their peers, resulting in increased psychological stress, lower self-esteem, and/or depression, since they were still maturing psychosocially.
