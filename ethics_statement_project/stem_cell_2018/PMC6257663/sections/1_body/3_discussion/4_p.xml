<p>After serial applications of topical sodium nitrite, the leg ulcer group demonstrated improvements in PCS scores, possibly related to a reduction in pain, as previously reported.

  <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]
 </sup> This improvement was observed especially in those with &gt;50% ulcer healing (Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .08), suggesting a possible relationship between ulcer size and QOL. Additionally, bodily pain improved the most among the SF-36 dimensions (Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).
