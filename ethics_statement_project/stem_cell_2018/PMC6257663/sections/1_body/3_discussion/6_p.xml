 </sup> We compared our results to previously published PCS and MCS scores from patients with other diseases (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The PCS scores in patients with sickle leg ulcers were similar to patients with diabetic foot ulcers, receiving hemodialysis, or with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lower than patients with operated lung cancer or myocardial infarction. It was interesting to note that leg ulcers, which were perceived to be less medically urgent or require less medical attention, actually had a larger negative impact on QOL than some of the aforementioned diagnoses.
