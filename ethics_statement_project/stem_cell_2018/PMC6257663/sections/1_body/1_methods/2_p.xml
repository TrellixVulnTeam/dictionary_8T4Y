<p>All patients provided written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki to clinical research protocols approved by the institutional review board of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. We prospectively collected QOL data in two groups of adults with SCD. The leg ulcer group was comprised of those with at least one cutaneous ulcer of at least 4 weeks duration, and an ulcer surface area between 2.5 and 100 cm
 <sup>2</sup>, enrolling in a phase I trial using topical sodium nitrite (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01316796).

 </sup> The accrual to a higher dose of sodium nitrite, from 0.5% to 2%, was based on the tolerability (lack of blood pressure changes, pain or edema after application, or methemoglobinemia &lt;7%). The leg ulcer group received standard wound care and experimental topical sodium nitrite twice weekly for 4 weeks while continuing their sickle specific therapy (hydroxyurea or chronic transfusions). Those with small ulcers (&lt;2.5 cm
 <sup>2</sup>), ulcers with infection, or ulcers suspected to be due to comorbid diabetes, venous stasis, or peripheral vascular disease were excluded.
