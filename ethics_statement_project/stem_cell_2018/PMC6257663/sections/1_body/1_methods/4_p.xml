<p>Both groups completed a baseline Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Survey (SF-36). A follow-up SF-36 was obtained in the leg ulcer group after sodium nitrite treatment. All surveys were scored using the algorithm set forth by the SF-36 Health Survey Manual.

 </sup> The SF-36 embodies 8 scaled health dimensions including: physical function, physical role functioning, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social role functioning, emotional role functioning, and mental health. These 8 subscales were combined and reported here as physical and mental component summary (PCS and MCS) scores, as frequently reported in the literature. Subscale, PCS, and MCS scores are on a 100-point scale and have a normative mean of 50, with a standard deviation (SD) of 10, based on the 1998 National Survey of Functional Health Status.

 </sup> The accrual of the study was based on the tolerability of sodium nitrite application, not on secondary QOL measures.
