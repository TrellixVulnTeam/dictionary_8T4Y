<p>The entire cohort included a total of 32 participants, mean age of 35.9 ± 9.4 years (range 18–58). Seventeen participants were in the leg ulcer group (mean age 37 ± 10.2) and 15 in the control group (mean age 34.67 ± 8.6;

In the control group, all were taking hydroxyurea for at least 2 months in preparation for planned hematopoietic cell transplant. Mean baseline PCS scores were lower than MCS scores (
