<p>Using the overall mean age, we further analyzed those &gt;35 years and those ≤35 years at baseline. Individuals ≤35 years with leg ulcers had lower baseline MCS scores (40.7 ± 6.9, n = 8) than those in the same age group without a leg ulcer (51.1 ± 10.9, n = 9, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .03) and those &gt;35 years with a leg ulcer (50.8 ± 9.8, n = 9, 
 <italic>P</italic> 
 <italic>=</italic> .01). No other significant differences were noted in baseline summary scores between the corresponding leg ulcer subgroups.
