  <p>Changes in 
   <italic>JAK2</italic>-V617F allele burden during the treatment period. (A) Waterfall plot representing the percent changes in 
   <italic>JAK2</italic>-V617F allele burden at 24 weeks. (B) Time course of 
   <italic>JAK2</italic>-V617F allele burden in patients treated with mirabegron. The values measured before treatment (week 0), and at week 12 and week 24 of mirabegron treatment are shown for each individual patient, connected by dashed lines. Filled triangles, circles and squares are used for essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) patients, respectively. Within the group of myelofibrosis (MF) patients, post-ET and post-PV myelofibrosis are indicated by open triangles and circles, respectively.
