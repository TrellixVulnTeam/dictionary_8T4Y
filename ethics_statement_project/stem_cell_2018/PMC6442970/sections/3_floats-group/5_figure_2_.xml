  <p>Reticulin fibrosis and nestin positive (nestin
   <sup>+</sup>) cells before and after treatment with mirabegron. (A) Bone marrow histology of a patient before (week 0) and at the end (week 24) of treatment with mirabegron. (Top) Reticulin fibers are stained black by silver impregnation (Gömöri). (Bottom) Immunohistochemical staining with a monoclonal antibody against human nestin protein. Note decrease of reticulin fibrosis and increase of nestin
   <sup>+</sup> cells (brown staining) after 24 weeks of treatment. Magnification: 200x. (B) Single patient evolutional curves of the grade of reticulin fibrosis (left) and nestin
   <sup>+</sup> mesenchymal cells/mm
   <sup>2</sup> (right) at study inclusion and after 24 weeks of mirabegron. n: number; PMF: primary myelofibrosis; ET: essential thrombocythemia; PV: polycythemia vera; MF: myelofibrosis.
