<p>The 
 <italic>JAK2</italic>-V617F allele burden was determined on DNA from purified granulocytes isolated from PB sampled in EDTA-containing tubes. The allele-specific PCR of 
 <italic>JAK2</italic> genotyping was performed as previously described.

 </sup> The 
 <italic>JAK2</italic>-V617F allele burden was validated by retesting. Capture-based next-generation sequencing with a panel of 94 genes to detect somatic mutations in granulocyte DNA was performed in patients who consented to this subproject on a voluntary basis. For details see the 
 <italic>Online Supplementary Methods</italic>.
