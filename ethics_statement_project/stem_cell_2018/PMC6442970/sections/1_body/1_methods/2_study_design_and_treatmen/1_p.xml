Before the study began, the drug had already been approved in the US, EU and Switzerland for the treatment of patients with an overactive bladder with a maximal recommended dose of 50 mg daily. The trial consisted of mirabegron treatment for at least 24 weeks with an initial dose of 25 mg daily during the first week followed upon good tolerance by 50 mg mirabegron daily during the remaining treatment period. The following treatments were not allowed during the trial treatment phase: other anticancer treatments, drugs known to influence
