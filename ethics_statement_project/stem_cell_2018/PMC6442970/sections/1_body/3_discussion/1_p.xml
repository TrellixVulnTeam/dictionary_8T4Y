<p>Mirabegron was safe and well tolerated in patients with 
 <italic>JAK2</italic>-mutated MPNs. However, the primary end point of reducing the 
 <italic>JAK2</italic>-V617F allele burden was not reached (

 <italic>JAK2</italic>-V617F-driven mouse model of MPN, treatment with the β-3-sympathomimetic agonist BRL37344 lowered platelet and neutrophil counts, and decreased mutant hematopoietic progenitor numbers and spleen size.

 </sup> However, we did not observe effects on blood counts, spleen size or CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells in our phase II study. Species differences in the β3-adrenergic signaling and responsiveness of β3-adrenergic receptors towards different agonists between human and mouse could contribute to the observed discrepancies. Mirabegron is selective for the human β3-adrenergic receptor and was less effective in mice,
