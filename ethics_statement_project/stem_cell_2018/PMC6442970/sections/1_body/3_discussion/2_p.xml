<p>Nevertheless, some of the effects observed in the preclinical 
 <italic>JAK2</italic>-V617F mouse model treated with BRL37344, i.e. increase in nestin
 <sup>+</sup> bone marrow MSCs and decrease in myelofibrosis, were also seen in our mirabegron study: BM biopsies performed in a subset of 20 patients revealed a significant increase in the nestin
 <sup>+</sup> MSCs and a decrease in reticulin fibrosis (

Although the beneficial effect of mirabegron on reticulin fibrosis was moderate, the duration of treatment was also rather short (24 weeks), as it was mainly designed to assess the primary end point of reduction of allele burden. The question of whether a higher dose of mirabegron might have been more effective is difficult to answer. Although doses of 100 mg daily have been tested in earlier clinical studies, no clear dose-dependent effect has been observed, while cardiovascular symptoms and a prolongation of the QT interval were noted.

 </sup> The fact that nestin
 <sup>+</sup> cells showed a robust increase at 24 weeks of treatment indicates that mirabegron at 50 mg daily had one of the expected biological effects that had previously been described in mouse experiments.
