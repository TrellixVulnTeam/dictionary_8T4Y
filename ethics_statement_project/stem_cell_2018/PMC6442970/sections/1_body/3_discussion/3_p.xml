<p>Surprisingly, the effect on reticulin fibrosis was limited to patients who did not receive hydroxyurea treatment (41% of patients). The mechanism of how hydroxyurea interfered with the effect of mirabegron on reticulin fibrosis is currently unknown. Previous reports suggest that hydroxyurea alone can reduce reticulin fibrosis in some MPN patients.

 </sup> Selecting patients who have not previously received hydroxyurea, a longer trial duration and higher dosage of mirabegron will be considered for future studies in MPN.
