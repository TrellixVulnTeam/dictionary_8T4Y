<p>Despite the fact that the primary end point of reducing 
 <italic>JAK2</italic>-V617F allele burden was not reached in this trial, the observed effects on nestin
 <sup>+</sup> MSCs and reticulin fibrosis is encouraging and shows that a β-3-sympathomimetic agonist can modify the microenvironment where the 
 <italic>JAK2</italic>-mutant stem cells are maintained. These results generate an interest in evaluating β-3-sympathomimetic agonists specifically in patients with myelofibrosis not pretreated with hydroxyurea, and possibly in combination with other substances.
