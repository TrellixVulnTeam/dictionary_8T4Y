<p>A slight decrease in reticulin fiber content from a median grade of 1.0 (IQR 0–3) to 0.5 (IQR 0–2) (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.01) and an increase in the nestin
 <sup>+</sup> MSCs cells from a median of 1.09/mm
 <sup>2</sup> (IQR 0.38–3.27) to 3.95/mm
 <sup>2</sup> (IQR 1.98–8.79) (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001) were observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-1040710">Figure 2</xref>). The mean change in the nestin
 <sup>+</sup> cells from baseline to week 24 was 3.52/mm
 <sup>2</sup> [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.65-5.39]. We found no correlation between reticulin fibrosis or nestin
 <sup>+</sup> cell content with time from diagnosis to study inclusion, blood counts, splenomegaly, and 
 <italic>JAK2</italic>-V617F allele burden. The decrease in reticulin fibrosis was limited to patients without hydroxyurea treatment (-0.85/mm
 <sup>2</sup> without hydroxyurea 
 <italic>vs</italic>. 0.0/m
 <sup>2</sup> with hydroxyurea; 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.042). No statistically significant differences in CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell numbers were noted on paired samples before and after 24 weeks of mirabegron. Quantitative assessment of megakaryocyte numbers showed no differences between baseline to week 24 (median 25.5/mm
 <sup>2</sup>, IQR 16.75–34.25 
 <italic>vs</italic>. 22/mm
 <sup>2</sup>, IQR 14.38–29.63; 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.371), but a trend towards reduction in megakaryocyte cluster formation and decrease in numbers of large megakaryocytes with staghorn-like morphology was noted in some patients.
