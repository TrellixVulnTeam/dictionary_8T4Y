<p>During the trial, 20 patients (51%) suffered from at least one disease-related symptom (DRS). Considering the highest CTCAE 4.0 grade DRS per patient, only one (3%) DRS was grade 3 (abdominal distension), 6 (15%) were grade 2, and 13 (33%) grade 1. Most DRS were gastrointestinal (abdominal distension, early satiety), general (fatigue, fever), microvascular (erythromelalgia, acroparesthesia, digital ischemia), headache, and pruritus.</p>
