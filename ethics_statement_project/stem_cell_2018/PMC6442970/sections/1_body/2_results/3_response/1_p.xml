<p>None of the patients reached the primary end point of a 50% or more reduction of 
 <italic>JAK2</italic>-V617F allele burden at 24 weeks (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1040710">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <italic>Online Supplementary Appendix</italic>). The median percent change from baseline to week 24 was an increase of 6.1% [interquartile range (IQR) 3.2-13.8%]. One patient reached the secondary end point with a reduction of 
 <italic>JAK2</italic>-V617F allele burden of 25% or more after 24 weeks. Hematologic response according to European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and International Working Group Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) criteria was observed in 5 out of 21 patients with PV (24%): 2 of them had a complete response (CR) (10%) and 3 a partial response (PR) (14%) (
 <xref rid="t4-1040710" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Two of 7 ET patients (29%) showed a PR, i.e. reduction in platelet count. One patient with MF became transfusion-independent (9%), all other MF patients (n=10) showed no response (91%). There was no difference in spleen size between baseline and 24 weeks by ultrasound [median spleen longitudinal diameter 15 cm (IQR 13–21) 
 <italic>vs</italic>. 16 cm (IQR 14–19)]. All parameters measured are listed in 
 <italic>Online Supplementary Table S1</italic>.
