 <p>The β-3 sympathomimetic agonist BRL37344 restored nestin-positive cells within the stem cell niche, and thereby normalized blood counts and improved myelofibrosis in a mouse model of 
  <italic>JAK2</italic>-V617F-positive myeloproliferative neoplasms. We therefore tested the effectiveness of mirabegron, a β-3 sympathomimetic agonist, in a phase II trial including 39 
  <italic>JAK2</italic>-V617F-positive patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and a mutant allele burden more than 20%. Treatment consisted of mirabegron 50 mg daily for 24 weeks. The primary end point was reduction of 
  <italic>JAK2</italic>-V617F allele burden of 50% or over, but this was not reached in any of the patients. One patient achieved a 25% reduction in 
  <italic>JAK2</italic>-V617F allele burden by 24 weeks. A small subgroup of patients showed hematologic improvement. As a side study, bone marrow biopsies were evaluated in 20 patients. We found an increase in the nestin
  <sup>+</sup> cells from a median of 1.09 (interquartile range 0.38-3.27)/mm
  <sup>2</sup> to 3.95 (interquartile range 1.98-8.79)/mm
  <sup>2</sup> (
  <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001) and a slight decrease of reticulin fibrosis from a median grade of 1.0 (interquartile range 0–3) to 0.5 (interquartile range 0–2) (
  <italic>P</italic>=0.01) between start and end of mirabegron treatment. Despite the fact that the primary end point of reducing 
  <italic>JAK2</italic>-V617F allele burden was not reached, the observed effects on nestin
  <sup>+</sup> mesenchymal stem cells and reticulin fibrosis is encouraging, and shows that mirabegron can modify the microenvironment where the 
  <italic>JAK2</italic>-mutant stem cells are maintained. (Registered at
