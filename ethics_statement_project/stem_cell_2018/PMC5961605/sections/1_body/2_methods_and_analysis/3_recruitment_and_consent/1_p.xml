<p>Patients who are referred to the RNOH will be identified as potentially eligible for the trial by the Chief Investigator (CI) or delegated clinician and invited to participate. The RNOH is a tertiary referral centre for AT and potential participants will be referred by letter to the Foot and Ankle Department at the RNOH. The CI or delegated clinicians at the Foot and Ankle Department will review referral letters. In the main, it may not be possible to identify relevant patients with chronic mid-portion AT from the referral letters; however, Patient Information Sheets may be sent by post or email to referred patients informing them of the trial. The CI or delegate will wait until the patient is seen in the initial outpatient consultation to explain the trial in more detail and if they are eligible invite them to participate. Participant Identification Centres (PIC) will also be used to identify potential patients for the trial and these may include primary care musculoskeletal triage services. Potential participants will be referred by the PIC to the trial site.</p>
