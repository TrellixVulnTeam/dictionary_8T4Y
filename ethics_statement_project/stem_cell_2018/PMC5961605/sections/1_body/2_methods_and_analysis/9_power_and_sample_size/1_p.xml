<p>Sample size was determined to ensure a predetermined level of accuracy for the incidence of SARÂ using an exact binomial CI. With 10 participants, if no SAR is observed we can rule out a true SAR rate of 31% or greater with 95% confidence, or a true SAR rate of 21% or greater with 80% confidence, or a true SAR rate of 13% or greater with 50% confidence. With six participants for the interim analysis, if no SAR is observed we can rule out a true SAR rate of 46% or greater with 95% confidence, or a true SAR rate of 32% or greater with 80% confidence, or a true SAR rate of 21% or greater with 50% confidence. Since the study is a proof-of-concept pilot study, no formal power calculation was performed.</p>
