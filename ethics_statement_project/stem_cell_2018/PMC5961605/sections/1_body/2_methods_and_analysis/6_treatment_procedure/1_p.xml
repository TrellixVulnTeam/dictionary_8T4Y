<p>For eligible participants, approximately 8 mL of bone marrow aspirate will be collected from the posterior iliac crest into a heparinised syringe under either local or general anaesthetic. A decision on which technique will be used will depend on discussions with the patient. MSC processing and manufacturing will be at the cell-processing centre at the Centre for Cell Gene and Tissue Therapeutics based at the Royal Free Hospital in London. The cells are cultured using a standardised protocol using fetal calf serum in the culture medium with robust validation systems to confirm quality and sterility of cells. Approximately 5 weeks after bone marrow harvest, participants will undergo implantation of the culture expanded MSCs under local anaesthetic in the outpatient setting following clinical assessment and tendon imaging using conventional ultrasound and UTC measurement.
