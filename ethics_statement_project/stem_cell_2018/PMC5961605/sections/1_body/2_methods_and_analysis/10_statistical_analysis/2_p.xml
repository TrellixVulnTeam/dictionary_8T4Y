<p>Continuous baseline data will be presented as mean and SD for normally distributed variables, medians and IQRs for non-normally distributed variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical baseline variables. For the primary outcome, the proportion of participants experiencing a SAR at any time over the 24-week follow-up period will be calculated along with exact binomial CIs to express the uncertainty in the observed incidence rate of SAR.</p>
