<p>Since the primary outcome is the incidence of SARs, missing outcomes are not anticipated. The primary analysis will be as per-protocol. All participants will receive the same treatment, which cannot be withdrawn once given and we will only analyse the data from the participants who actually receive autologous culture expanded MSCs. Cancellation of implantation will be a logistical rather than surgical decision and as such is not expected to introduce bias. The proportion of participants experiencing a success at 6 months will be calculated along with exact binomial CIs to express the uncertainty in the observed incidence of success at 6 months. Changes from baseline in EQ-5D, MOXFQ, VAS (pain), VISA-A and SAS scores will be summarised as mean and SD if normally distributed, or median and IQR if the data do not demonstrate normality.</p>
