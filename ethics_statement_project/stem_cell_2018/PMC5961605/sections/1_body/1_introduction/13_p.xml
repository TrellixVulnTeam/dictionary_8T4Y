 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> looked at eight patients with patella tendinopathy. BMCs from the iliac crest were injected into the patella tendon under ultrasound guidance. At a mean follow-up of 5 years, there was significant improvement in most clinical scores. This improvement was seen up to year 2 after which it plateaued. Ultrasound evaluation was at 6 months,Â which showed that eight of the nine patients had improvement in the grading of the patella tendinopathy.
