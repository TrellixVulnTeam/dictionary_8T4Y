<p>The use of PRP is controversial. One randomised controlled trialÂ (RCT) looked at PRP versus stromal vascular fraction (SVF) derived from adipose. SVF has been shown to be source of MSCs. They showed that the use of PRP and SVF was safe and that both PRP and SVF improved clinical scores with statistical significance. The use of SVF seemed to provide quicker improvement but at 180 days there was no difference between the two groups.
