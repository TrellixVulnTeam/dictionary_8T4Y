<p>Laboratory-based studies looking at autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) injections into damaged tendons have shown improved functional and histological outcomes.
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12â€“15</xref> Smith 
 <italic>et al</italic> published an equine case-control trial comparing autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs and saline injections. The treated tendons exhibited statistically significant improvements in key parameters with normalisation of biomechanical, morphological and compositional parameters.
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Another study followed up 141 horses postintralesional MSC injection for digital flexor tendinopathy. Two-year follow-up showed no adverse effects of the treatment with no aberrant tissue on histological examination. The re-injury percentage was significantly less than published for national hunt racehorses treated in other ways.
