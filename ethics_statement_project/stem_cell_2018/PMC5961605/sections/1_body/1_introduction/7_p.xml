<p>Although the majority of tendon conditions are treated non-operatively, up to 45% of patients at some stage consider surgery.
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Tendon disorders are a major burden on the National Health Service (NHS). A total of 51 454 operations on tendon disorders were performed in the NHS in 2015/2016 (HESOnline), which is up from 48 765 operations performed in 2004/2005. Given that the majority of tendon problems are treated non-operatively, this high surgical caseload represents just the tip of the iceberg of the real cost to the health service of tendon disease. There is therefore a need for safe and effective non-surgical treatments.
