 <xref rid="t3-1040986" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> gives the distribution of DFS events by arm. The 4-year cumulative incidence rates for each type of relapse are summarized in 
 <xref rid="t4-1040986" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, by regimen. The cumulative incidence of isolated bone marrow relapses was significantly different between the control arm and experimental arm 1 (2.5±1.1% 
 <italic>versus</italic> 14.5±3.3%, 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.025). Grade 5 toxicity rates were 5.0% on the control arm (n=12) and 2.9% on experimental arm 1 (n=14). Of the 12 grade 5 toxicities reported among patients on the control arm, six occurred on therapy. These six deaths were attributed to infection (n=4) and multi-organ failure (n=2). Of the 14 deaths reported among patients on experimental arm 1, five occurred while on therapy and were attributed to infection (n=3), thrombosis (n=1) and multi-organ failure (n=1). A total of 235 subjects on the control arm and 477 on experimental arm 1 completed part 2 of consolidation and had toxicity data submitted. There were no significant differences in grade 3/4 adverse events or delays in starting the interim maintenance-1 phase of therapy after consolidation between the control arm and experimental arm 1 (
 <xref rid="t5A-1040986" ref-type="table">Table 5A</xref>). In addition, a total of 193 subjects on the control arm and 389 on experimental arm 1 completed part 2 of delayed intensification and had toxicity data submitted. There were no significant differences in grade 3/4 adverse events or delays in starting the interim maintenance-1 phase of therapy after delayed intensification between the control arm and experimental arm 1 (
