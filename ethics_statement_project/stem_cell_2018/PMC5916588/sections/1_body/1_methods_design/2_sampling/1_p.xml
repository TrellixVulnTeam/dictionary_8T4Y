<p id="Par54">The eligibility criteria will include adult patients between 18 and 60 years who are victims of a severe (Glasgow Coma Scale ≤8) acute (hospital admission within less than 8 h from trauma) TBI and present with the DAI diagnosis. Patients younger than 18 years old will be excluded due to the known different physiopathology typical of this age. We excluded patients older than 60 because different studies revealed that these patients had a significantly worse outcome after TBI. Six months after severe head injury, 92% were dead, vegetative, or severely disabled. Four class I studies demonstrated a mortality of &gt;75% in severely brain-injured patients older than 60. The critical age threshold for worsening prognosis appears to be above 60 in a review of class I and II studies [
