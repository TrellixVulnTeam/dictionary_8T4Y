<p id="Par55">DAI diagnosis is histopathological. It can be clinically defined by coma lasting 6 h or more after TBI, excluding cases of swelling or ischemic brain lesions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Focal brain injury may produce mass effects from hemorrhagic contusion or hematoma, which can induce herniation and brain stem compression, and the resultant may be coma, which is not usually immediate but develops in a secondary fashion. Otherwise, DAI can be a sole source of post-traumatic coma in the absence of mass lesions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. MRI will be performed in all patients for documentation. However, MRI cannot demonstrate DAI lesions in up to 10% of patients. Therefore, patients with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ≤8 lasting more than 6 h without MRI or with normal CT or normal MRI will also be diagnosed as having DAI, if no other reasons justify the coma status [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Patients will be considered to have awakened from coma when they score 6 points in the best motor response in the GCS, consequently not being included in this protocol.
