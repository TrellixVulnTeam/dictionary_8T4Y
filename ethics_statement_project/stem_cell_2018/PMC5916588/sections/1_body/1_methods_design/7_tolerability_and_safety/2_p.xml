<p id="Par84">There are no studies with photobiomodulation (PBM) for severe TBI patients in the acute stage of trauma. Considering that fact, some safety precautions will be taken. There are no papers studying the possible effect of increasing the ICP due to PBM. But some chronic-stage studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] noticed a blood flow increase. The possible ICP increase due to that will be monitored by ICP catheter insertion or non-invasive methods (when catheter insertion cannot be performed for any reason). Because of the improvement effect in chronic TBI patients, the authors do not believe that this intervention could be harmful. ICP monitoring will add safety to this study. If elevation of ICP happens, the authors will stop the session and observe if intervention for ICP control is required. The patient will be evaluated in the following session, and if elevation happens again, the patient will be excluded.
