 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Our device has already been considered safe in this regard; in addition, the protocol includes monitoring the head skin and global temperature of the patient during the sessions. If there is harmful elevation of skin temperature in the area of stimulation, the session will be interrupted and the patient will be reevaluated. If this effect is noticed in the following session, exclusion of the patient will be considered for safety.
