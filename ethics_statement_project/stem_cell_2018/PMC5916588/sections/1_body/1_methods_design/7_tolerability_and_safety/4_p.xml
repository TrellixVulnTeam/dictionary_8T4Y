<p id="Par86">Low-level light therapy (photobiomodulation), which is the principle of therapy of this protocol, is registered on the Food and Drug Administration, and the adverse effects described are ocular injuries and electrical shock [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Ocular injuries should not happen in this protocol since the LED will not be applied close to the eyes. But, for safety, the eyes will be evaluated for redness or irritation after each session. Electrical shock is unlikely in this protocol because the helmets are supplied by internal batteries. However, it will be reported and dealt with by the engineer responsible for maintenance of the helmet, if it happens.
