 <sup>2</sup> power density, 10-J/cm
 <sup>2</sup> energy density, 13-mm spot size, and 40 J/cm
 <sup>2</sup> per treatment. These parameters were chosen based on the optimal wavelength penetration within biological tissues (wavelength range of 600–1000 nm). At short wavelengths, absorption occurs predominantly by chromophores such as melanin and hemoglobin.
