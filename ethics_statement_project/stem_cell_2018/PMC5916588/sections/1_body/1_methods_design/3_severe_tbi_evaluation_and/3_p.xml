<p id="Par77">The decision for catheter insertion is made by the on-call attending neurosurgeon. Patients in whom the catheter cannot be inserted for any reason are evaluated by non-invasive strategies (optic nerve sheath ultrasonography or transcranial Doppler) for ICP monitoring and CT scan. In our center, all TBI patients are submitted to head CT scans at admission, within 6 h after trauma, on the third and the fifth day after trauma, or before these times if they present any neurological deterioration (which is commonly defined as a decrease of two or more points in the motor component of the Glasgow Coma Scale) [
