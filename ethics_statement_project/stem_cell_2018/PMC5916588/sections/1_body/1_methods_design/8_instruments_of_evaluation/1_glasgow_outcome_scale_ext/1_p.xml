<p id="Par87">It is an expansion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] with the objective of complementing the limitation of the original Glasgow Outcome Scale [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Despite being more practical, the five original groups (Dead, Vegetative State, Severe Disability, Moderate Disability, Good Recovery) of the original scale are broad and therefore insensitive to subtle changes in functional status [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The 8-point Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE), developed only in 1981, provides different criteria to subdivide the upper three categories of the scale: Death, Vegetative State, Lower Severe Disability, Upper Severe Disability, Lower Moderate Disability, Upper Moderate Disability, Lower Good Recovery, Upper Good Recovery [
