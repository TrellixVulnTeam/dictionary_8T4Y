<p id="Par93">The first Marshall classification based on computed tomographic abnormalities was published in 1991 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] and was composed of four groups of patients. In 2005, these criteria were reviewed and two new groups were added [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Recently, the Marshall computed tomographic classification has six different groups:
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par94">Diffuse injury I (no visible pathology)—no visible intracranial pathology seen on the CT scan.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par95">Diffuse injury II—cisterns are present with a midline shift of 0–5 mm and/or lesion densities present; no high- or mixed-density lesion 25 cm
    <sup>3</sup>; may include bone fragments and foreign bodies.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par96">Diffuse injury III (swelling)—cisterns compressed or absent with a midline shift of 0–5 mm; no high- or mixed-density lesion 25 mm.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par97">Diffuse injury IV (shift)—a midline shift of 5 mm; no high- or mixed-density lesion 25 cm
    <sup>3</sup>.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par98">Evacuated mass lesion V—any lesion surgically evacuated.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par99">Non-evacuated mass lesion VI—high- or mixed-density lesion 25 cm
    <sup>3</sup>; not surgically evacuated.
   </p>
  </list-item>
