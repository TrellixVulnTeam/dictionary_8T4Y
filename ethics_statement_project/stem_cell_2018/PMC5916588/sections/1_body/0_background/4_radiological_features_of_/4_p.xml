<p id="Par28">Disability symptoms caused by brain lesions are not usually evident in structural computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. CT may show some petechial foci of hemorrhage in the acute phase, but it underestimates DAI extent because less than 20% of DAI lesions are hemorrhagic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Other radiologic features which could be appear are as follows: (1) single or multiple small intraparenchymal hemorrhages in the cerebral hemispheres (&lt;2 cm in diameter); (2) intraventricular hemorrhage; (3) hemorrhage in the corpus callosum; (4) small focal areas of hemorrhage adjacent to the third ventricle (&lt;2 cm in diameter); (5) brain stem hemorrhage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Intraventricular hemorrhage arises from disruption of the subependymal plexus of the capillaries and veins that lie along the ventricular surface of the septum pellucidum, fornix, and corpus callosum [
