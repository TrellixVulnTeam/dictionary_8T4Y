<p id="Par29">DAI is caused by shearing forces which transect small blood vessels running in parallel with axons, leading to detectable microscopic hemorrhages. Gradient echo and T2*-weighted MR images detect signal dropout provoked by ion-containing heme groups in slow-moving blood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. MRI is more sensitive in the identification of shearing injuries because it enables detection of non-hemorrhagic as well as hemorrhagic lesions. The axoplasmic leakage and edema around areas of neuronal disruption in non-hemorrhagic lesions are more conspicuous on T2-weighted images [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) MRI scans can show DAI signs [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. DTI is sensitive to detect water diffusion in the brain, presenting microstructural lesions in white matter tracts [
