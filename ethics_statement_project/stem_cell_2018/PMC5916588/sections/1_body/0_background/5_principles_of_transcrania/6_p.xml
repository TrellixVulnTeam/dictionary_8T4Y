<p id="Par47">Current small studies with acute severe TBI mice used transcranial NIR photobiomodulation to treat them. These studies have supported the notion that transcranial photobiomodulation increases neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. The protocol began 4 h post-TBI, and they discovered that there was significantly better recovery at 28 days post-TBI in mice receiving three daily transcranial NIR photobiomodulation treatments when compared to controls. The neurogenesis was notedly increased when measured by immunofluorescence staining of brain sections [
