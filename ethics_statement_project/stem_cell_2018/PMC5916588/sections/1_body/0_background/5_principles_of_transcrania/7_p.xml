<p id="Par48">The estimated mean of NIR light penetration depth through the scalp and skull is 23.6 ± 0.7 mm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Considering the different areas of the skull, the percentage of penetration also changes (0.9% at the temporal region, 2.1% at the frontal region, and 11.7% at the occipital region) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Transcranial photobiomodulation application is easier in the forehead, because of the absence of hair and longer wavelength, which facilitates NIR light penetration [
