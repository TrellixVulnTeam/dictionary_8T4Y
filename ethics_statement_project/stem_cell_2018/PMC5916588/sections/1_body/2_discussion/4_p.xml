<p id="Par140">The first animal model described with TBI treated with TCLT (808-nm NIR/red LED) was performed with mice. Mice were submitted to only one TCLT section for 4 h. An important reduction (about 90%) of post-injury area size was noticed. Neurological severity scores were also significantly lower at 28 days for laser-treated mice [
