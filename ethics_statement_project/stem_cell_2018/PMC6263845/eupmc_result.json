To the authors' knowledge, data regarding patients treated on contemporary protocols without cranial irradiation are limited.<h4>Methods</h4>Changes in z scores for body mass index (BMI), height, and weight from the time of diagnosis to 5 years off therapy were evaluated using multivariable analysis in 372 children with ALL who were aged 2 to 18 years at the time of diagnosis and were enrolled on the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Total XV protocol from 2000 through 2007.<h4>Results</h4>The percentage of overweight/obese patients increased from 25.5% at the time of diagnosis to approximately 50% during the off-therapy period.
