The role of such abnormalities on outcomes after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is unclear. We used genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism arrays to identify chromosomal aberrations in pre-HCT blood samples from 73 patients with FA who received unrelated donor HCT for severe aplastic anemia between 1991 and 2007. Outcome data and blood samples were available through the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. For survival analyses, we used the Kaplan-Meier estimator to calculate the survival probabilities and the exact log-rank test to compare the survival differences across groups. Chromosomal aberrations were detected in 16 (22%) patients; most frequent were clonal copy loss in chromosome 7 (9.6%), clonal copy gains in the long arm (q) of chromosome 1 (chr1q<sup>+</sup>) (8.2%), and clonal or complete copy gains in the q arm of chromosome 3 (chr3q<sup>+</sup>) (8.2%).
