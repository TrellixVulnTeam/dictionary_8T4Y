<p id="Par2">The initial treatment of multiple myeloma has undergone a dramatic change in the past decade with the routine incorporation of the proteasome inhibitors and/or immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) in induction regimens
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>. Multiple phase three trials have confirmed the beneficial role of these drugs for the initial treatment of myeloma, with longer duration of disease control as well as improved overall survival

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. Proteasome inhibitors in particular have become an integral part of the upfront regimens for MM, and appear to have significant impact on the outcome in patients with certain cytogenetic abnormalities associated with aggressive disease behavior
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. Proteasome inhibitors, when combined with immunomodulatory drugs such as lenalidomide or alkylating agents, have resulted in some of the most effective treatment regimens in myeloma to date
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>. Bortezomib, the initial proteasome inhibitor to enter the clinic, has been combined with a variety of different drugs
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. In a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of initial therapy of myeloma, the use of bortezomib was associated with better overall survival
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. Bortezomib, in combination with alkylating drugs such as melphalan and cyclophosphamide, is used extensively in patients with newly diagnosed myeloma
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. The combination of bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (VCD) has been studied in several phase 2 studies as well as a recent phase 3 trial, where it was compared with bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (VTD)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>. VCD is an effective combination, allowing rapid and deep control of the disease in previously untreated myeloma. However, it is associated with high risk of peripheral neuropathy and also requires weekly clinic visits for parenteral administration. While the risk of peripheral neuropathy with bortezomib has been mitigated to some extent with the weekly schedule and the use of subcutaneous administration, it still remains of concern
