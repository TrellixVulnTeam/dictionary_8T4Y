<p id="Par22">It is relevant to compare and contrast the results with the lenalidomide combinations of bortezomib and ixazomib, given the excellent results seen with VRd in the phase III SWOG trial, which has resulted in VRd being the most commonly used induction therapy in the US. The results of the SWOG trial (S0777) with the VRd combination is most comparable to the current trial in terms of the patient population enrolled, where the overall response with VRd was 81.5% with a VGPR or better of 42%. The combination of ixazomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (IRd) is a well-tolerated regimen in patients with newly diagnosed myeloma, both transplant eligible and ineligible. In a phase 2 trial, IRd was associated with an overall best response rate of 92% with increasing depth of response seen with longer duration of therapy. While the response rates are difficult to be compared directly between two phase-2 trials, ICd appears to be an effective regimen in the setting of newly diagnosed myeloma, although possibly with lower response rates than was observed with the lenalidomide combination. A direct comparison of VCd and VRd or ICd and IRd are not available from a clinical trial setting. In a retrospective study of the two regimens, the efficacy appeared to be comparable between the VCd and VRd regimens, but no similar data exist as of now for ICd and IRd

 </sup>. As with the bortezomib and lenalidomide combinations, longer duration of therapy translated into a deeper response and the lack of peripheral neuropathy can potentially allow for longer therapy.
