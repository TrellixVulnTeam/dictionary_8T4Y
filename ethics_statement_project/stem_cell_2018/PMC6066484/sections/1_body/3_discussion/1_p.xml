<p id="Par20">The current study, to our knowledge, is the first to report on the combination of ixazomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone in patients with newly diagnosed myeloma. Given the activity and long-term tolerability of ixazomib used in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with newly diagnosed as well as relapsed myeloma, other potential combinations are of great interest. In particular, the combination with cyclophosphamide required evaluation given the efficacy observed with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (VCd) as induction therapy in patients with newly diagnosed MM. Given the low risk of neurotoxicity with ixazomib, it offers the possibility of an all oral regimen, that can be tolerated for long periods of time, which is less expensive compared with the lenalidomide combination.</p>
