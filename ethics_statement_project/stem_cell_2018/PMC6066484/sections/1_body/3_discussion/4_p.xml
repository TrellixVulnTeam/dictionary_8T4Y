<p id="Par23">The toxicity profile of the regimen has been very similar to that seen with the VCd regimens, with the exception of peripheral neuropathy. No grade 3 or higher PN was seen in this cohort, compared to 12â€“17% grade 3 and higher PN seen with the bortezomib combinations. We undertook a detailed evaluation of peripheral neuropathy over time using prospectively administered patient questionnaires and demonstrated a lack of any cumulative neurotoxicity. As with other ixazomib combinations, we did observe gastrointestinal toxicity, particularly nausea, but this was manageable with dose modifications and supportive care measures. Hematological toxicity remains the most common category of adverse events observed but was similar in spectrum as has been seen with the VCd and IRd combinations. No cumulative hematological toxicity was observed across the multiple cycles of the combination among those who continued on therapy. For patients, who plan to collect stem cells, no adverse effect was seen on the ability to collect stem cells. This is consistent with what has been observed with VCd or IRd.</p>
