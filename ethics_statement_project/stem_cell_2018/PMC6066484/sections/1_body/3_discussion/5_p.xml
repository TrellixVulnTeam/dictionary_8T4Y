<p id="Par24">In conclusion, the combination of ixazomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone is a well-tolerated and effective, all oral combination that can be used for initial therapy of newly diagnosed myeloma. The efficacy is comparable to that seen with bortezomib-based regimens with significantly lower neurotoxicity. The convenience and tolerability makes this regimen particularly relevant for the older, non-transplant eligible patient in whom longer term therapy is planned. In comparison to the lenalidomide based combination, cyclophosphamide offers a lower cost option without compromising the efficacy and the ability to move ahead with stem cell collection and autologous transplant, if eligible and desired. Additionally, ICd can serve as a foundation to which monoclonal antibodies can be combined to further improve efficacy without the cost of three novel agents used simultaneously.</p>
