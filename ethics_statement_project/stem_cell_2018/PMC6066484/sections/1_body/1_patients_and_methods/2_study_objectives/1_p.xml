<p id="Par5">The primary objective of the phase 1 portion of the study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose of cyclophosphamide that can be combined with ixazomib and dexamethasone in patients with previously untreated symptomatic MM. The primary objective of the phase 2 portion was to determine the complete (CR) plus very good partial response (VGPR) rate (â‰¥VGPR) of ixazomib, used in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone in patients with previously untreated symptomatic MM. Secondary objectives included an assessment of progression-free survival and overall survival among patients with previously untreated symptomatic MM following treatment with ixazomib in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone followed by ixazomib maintenance until progression and to determine the toxicities associated with ixazomib used in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone in patients with NDMM. Correlative studies included assessment of ixazomib pharmacokinetics when combined with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone and serial evaluation of neurotoxicity using patient completed questionnaires.</p>
