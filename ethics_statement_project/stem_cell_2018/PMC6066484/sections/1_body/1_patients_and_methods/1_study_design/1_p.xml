<p id="Par4">This was a sequential phase 1 study designed to determine the optimal dose of cyclophosphamide to be combined with ixazomib and dexamethasone followed by a phase 2 component to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of combining weekly oral cyclophosphamide with oral ixazomib citrate given weekly along with dexamethasone in patients with previously untreated MM (NDMM). The phase 1 portion utilized the standard cohort 3 + 3 design. Three patients were treated at each dose level and observed for a minimum of 4 weeks (i.e., one full cycle) before new patients were enrolled into the same or next dose level. MTD was defined as the dose level below the lowest dose that induces dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in at least one-third of patients (at least 2 of a maximum of 6 patients). Doses were not escalated in any individual patient. The study enrolled 51 patients between August 2013 and August 2015. The study was performed in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonization, and the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and with approval of the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board.
