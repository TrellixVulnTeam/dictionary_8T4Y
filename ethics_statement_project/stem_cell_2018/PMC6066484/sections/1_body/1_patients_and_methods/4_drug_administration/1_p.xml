Dose modifications were made for ixazomib related toxicities with successive reductions in its dose to 3, 2.3, 2.3 mg every other week followed by discontinuation if the 2.3 mg dose every other week was not tolerated. Two doses of cyclophosphamide were evaluated in the phase 1 portion, 300 or 400 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup>, given weekly (days 1, 8, 15 and 22) during the 28-day cycle. Cyclophosphamide was progressively dose reduced to 300, 200 and 100 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> before discontinuation. Dexamethasone was decreased to 20, 12 and 4 mg prior to discontinuation. Prophylactic anti-emetics were recommended prior to each dose of ixazomib. Prophylactic anti-diarrheals were not used; however, the administration of anti-diarrheals was allowed after infectious causes were excluded. Topical steroids and other symptomatic measures were permitted for management of any skin rash. All patients were allowed to receive bisphosphonates and other supportive care as needed. Growth factor support for neutropenia was allowed beyond the first cycle of treatment in the phase 1 portion.
