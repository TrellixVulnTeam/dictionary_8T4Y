<p id="Par8">Induction therapy was defined as 12 cycles of the three-drug combination, after which patients could stay on single agent ixazomib at the last tolerated dose during induction phase, until disease progression, patient choice or unacceptable toxicity. Interruption of treatment for stem cell collection was allowed after completion of three cycles in patients who were transplant eligible and wanted to consider that option in the future. The choice of mobilization regimen was not specified by protocol. Patients went off study if at least a minor response (MR) was not seen after 3 cycles and at least a PR was not seen after 6 cycles, where the responses did not need to be confirmed.</p>
