<p id="Par13">Fifty-one patients were enrolled; including 10 patients in phase 1 (3 at 300 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> and 7 at 400 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup>) and 41 patients in phase 2. Two patients from the phase 1 portion and one patient from phase 2 were excluded from all analysis due to ineligibility. Data was frozen as of May 2017. The median age for the 48 evaluable patients was 64.5 years (range: 41–88) and 52% were male. The baseline characteristics at study entry for the entire study (
 <italic>n</italic> = 48) and for those in the phase 2 dosing (
 <italic>n</italic> = 45) are described in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Across the entire study, at the time of data cutoff, 11 (23%) patients had progressed and 46 (96%) were alive, with a median follow-up of 25.6 months (range: 12.3–44.6). Eight patients remain on therapy; reasons for drug discontinuation (
 <italic>N</italic>, %) were alternative treatment including transplant (19, 48%), disease progression (10, 25%), patient refusal (3, 8%), adverse event (3, 8%) and lack of pre-specified response threshold (5, 10%). Patient disposition by study arm is outlined in Supplementary Figure
