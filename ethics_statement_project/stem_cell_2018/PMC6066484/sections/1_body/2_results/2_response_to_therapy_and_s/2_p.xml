<p id="Par15">The median progression-free survival for the entire study population was not reached (NR) (95% CI: 31.3, NR); 18-month progression-free survival rate was 81% (95% CI: 70, 94). Median overall survival for the entire group was not reached; 18-month rate was 96% (95% CI: 90, 100) and 1-year overall survival was 100% (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Across the entire study, the median PFS was not reached for patients with mSMART high/ intermediate risk (95%CI: 15.4, NR) or for those with standard risk genetics (95% CI: 31.3, NR). The median DOR among the 37 patients with a partial response or better was not reached (95% CI: 22.3, NR) with 26 responders were still progression-free after a median of 23.7 months (range: 11.3â€“42.5).
