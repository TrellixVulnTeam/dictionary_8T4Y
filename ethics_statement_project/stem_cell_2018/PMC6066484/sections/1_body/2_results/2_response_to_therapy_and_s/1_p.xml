<p id="Par14">Overall, 37 (77%, 95% CI: 63, 88) patients achieved a confirmed partial response or better across the entire trial, with 35% (95% CI: 22, 50) achieving a VGPR or better. The response rates for the entire study as well as the 45 patients who were enrolled at the MTD are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, including response rates grouped by FISH based risk status. There was increasing depth of response as patients continued to receive additional cycles of therapy as indicated by Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Responses occurred rapidly, with the median time to response being 1.9 months (range: 0.9–4.8). Among the 48 patients, the response rate at the end of 4 cycles was 71%. Per protocol, 5 patients went off study for lack of an adequate response by pre-specified time point: MR not seen after 3 cycles (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1) and PR not seen after 6 cycles (
