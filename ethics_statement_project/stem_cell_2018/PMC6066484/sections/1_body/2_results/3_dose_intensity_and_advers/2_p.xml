<p id="Par17">An AE of any grade, that was considered at least possibly related, was reported in 100% of the patients. There were no dose-limiting toxicities among the 8 patients enrolled in the dose escalation phase. A grade 3 or 4 adverse event considered at least possibly related to drug administration was seen in 42 (88%) patients (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The most common grade 2 or higher toxicities included lymphopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, and nausea. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> provides the distribution of all grades of toxicities considered at least possibly related to drug administration. No cumulative hematological toxicity was observed across the entire trial as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>. Peripheral neuropathy at least possibly related to the drug was seen in 23 patients (grade 1), 5 patients (grade 2), and no patients experienced grade 3 or higher peripheral neuropathy. No cumulative neurotoxicity was seen as shown in Fig.
