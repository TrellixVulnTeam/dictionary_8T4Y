<p id="Par18">A total of 28 patients went on to stem cell collection while on study after a median of 5 cycles. The stem cell mobilization was performed with growth factor alone and plerixafor added in a risk-adapted manner or with cyclophosphamide priming. The median CD34 cell count was 9.2 million cells/kg (range: 4–51); no patient failed to collect at least 2.5 million CD34 cells/kg. Of the 28 patients with stem cell collection, 19 patients proceeded to an autologous stem cell transplant, after a median of 5 (range: 3–20) cycles of ICD. The response rate at the time of SCT, among those going to a transplant was 68%, including 4 patients with a VGPR or better.</p>
