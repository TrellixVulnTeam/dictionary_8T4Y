  <p>Treatment-free remission after 2-year consolidation with nilotinib. (A) Kaplan-Meier estimates of treatment-free survival after discontinuation of nilotinib (n=78). (B) The kinetics of 
   <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> transcripts in the treatment-free remission (TFR) phase. Twenty-five patients lost MR
   <sup>4.5</sup> within 12 months and eight patients showed fluctuations in the amounts of 
   <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> transcript around the MR
   <sup>4.5</sup> level. Among the eight patients with fluctuations, four lost MR
   <sup>4.5</sup> after 16, 16, 17, and 20 months. (C) Kaplan-Meier estimates of treatment-free survival after discontinuation of nilotinib according to the molecular response [molecular residual disease (MRD) positive or undetectable MRD (UMRD with MR
   <sup>5</sup>)] at enrollment in the TFR phase. UMRD with MR
   <sup>5</sup> was defined as undetectable 
   <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> transcripts by IS-PCR in which at least 100,000 control genes (
   <italic>ABL1</italic>) were required for the sensitivity of MR
   <sup>5</sup>. (D) Cumulative incidence of MR
   <sup>4.5</sup> in patients who lost MR
   <sup>4.5</sup> during the TFR phase and were subsequently readministered nilotinib (n=29). (E) Cumulative incidence of reacquisition of major molecular response (MMR) in patients who lost MMR and were readministered nilotinib (n=16).
