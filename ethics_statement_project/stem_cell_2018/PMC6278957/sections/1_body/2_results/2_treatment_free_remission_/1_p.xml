<p>Among the 96 patients in the safety analysis set, 78 with sustained MR
 <sup>4.5</sup> during the consolidation phase were eligible for nilotinib discontinuation in the TFR phase. The median follow-up of patients in the TFR phase was 35.4 months (range, 1.8–44.2). Among the 78 patients, 53 remained in the TFR phase without a confirmed loss of MR
 <sup>4.5</sup> in the first 12 months; the 12-month TFR primary endpoint was 67.9% (95% CI: 56.4–78.1%), exceeding the targeted 40% success rate. The 24-month TFR rate was 62.8% (95% CI: 51.1–73.5%). The Kaplan-Meier curve for treatment-free survival is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1031835">Figure 1A</xref>. The estimated 3-year treatment-free survival was 62.8%. Among patients with a confirmed loss of MR
 <sup>4.5</sup>, 25 patients lost the MR
 <sup>4.5</sup> within the first 6 months after discontinuing nilotinib (median, 3.4 months; range, 1.8–5.8 months), and the remaining four patients lost the MR
 <sup>4.5</sup> between 16 and 20 months within the TFR phase (
