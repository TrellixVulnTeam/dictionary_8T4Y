<p>Vascular adverse events of any grade were reported in six patients (6.2%) during the nilotinib consolidation phase (
 <xref rid="t4-1031835" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Ischemic heart disease (acute coronary syndrome or angina pectoris) was reported in three patients and cerebral infarctions in three patients, but peripheral arterial occlusive disease was not reported in any patient. Among the six patients with vascular adverse events, four had at least one traditional risk factor for such events (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking, or chronic kidney disease). Percutaneous intervention was performed in three patients with ischemic heart disease. All patients, except one, with vascular adverse events recovered or improved. Although three patients with vascular adverse events stopped nilotinib treatment and switched to another TKI, three patients continued the study treatment and entered the TFR phase, eventually achieving successful TFR. No patients developed new vascular adverse events during the TFR phase.
