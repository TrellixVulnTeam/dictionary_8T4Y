<p>Arthralgia was reported only in the TFR phase (
 <italic>Online Supplementary Table S2</italic>). Eleven patients reported musculoskeletal pain events during the early phase of the TFR; these events were categorized as TKI withdrawal syndrome. The characteristics of the patients with TKI withdrawal syndrome are described in 
 <xref rid="t5-1031835" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The median time of onset of the TKI withdrawal syndrome in the TFR phase was 1 month (range, 0â€“6). All patients recovered completely with or without treatment. Of the 11 patients with the syndrome, eight (73%) maintained TFR at 12 months and remained in remission throughout the 36-month follow-up period. There were no significant differences in the TFR survival curves between subgroups based on TKI withdrawal syndrome.
