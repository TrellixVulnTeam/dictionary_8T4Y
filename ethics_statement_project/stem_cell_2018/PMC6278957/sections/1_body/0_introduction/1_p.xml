<p>Nilotinib is a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that has been shown to be highly efficacious as a first- or second-line treatment for patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase. In patients newly diagnosed with CML in chronic phase superior rates of deep molecular response (DMR) were achieved with nilotinib in comparison with imatinib, which is a first-generation TKI currently used as the standard treatment for this disease.

 </sup> In addition, switching to nilotinib after a minimum of 2 years on imatinib led to increased DMR rates compared to remaining on imatinib.
