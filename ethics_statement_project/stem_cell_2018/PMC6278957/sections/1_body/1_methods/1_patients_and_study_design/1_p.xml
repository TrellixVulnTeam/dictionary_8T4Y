<p>The eligibility criteria for this multicenter, phase II, single-treatment arm, open-label clinical trial included: patients with CML in chronic phase, age ≥16 years, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–2, and no severe primary organ dysfunction. Patients who had accelerated phase or blast crisis CML, a T315I mutation, or who had received allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation were excluded from this study. Patients with a DMR (

 <sup>4.5</sup>, defined as a 4.5-log reduction in

Nilotinib (300 mg) was administered twice daily (600 mg/day) for 2 years in the consolidation phase. Patients who maintained a MR

 </sup> Patients with molecular recurrence during the TFR phase restarted nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, thus entering the re-treatment phase.
