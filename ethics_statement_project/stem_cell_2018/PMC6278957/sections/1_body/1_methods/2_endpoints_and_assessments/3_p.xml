 </italic> RQ-PCR was performed using a Molecular MD One-Step qRT-PCR 
 <italic>BCR-ABL</italic> kit (BML Inc., Kawagoe, Japan). To validate 
 <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> amplification, 
 <italic>ABL1</italic> was used as an internal control. A MMR was defined as a 3-log reduction in the 
 <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> transcript according to the international scale (
 <italic>BCR-ABL1
  <sup>IS</sup>
 </italic> ≤0.1%), MR
 <sup>4.5</sup> was defined as a 4.5-log reduction in the 
 <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> transcript (
 <italic>BCR-ABL1
  <sup>IS</sup>
 </italic> ≤0.0032%), and MR
 <sup>5</sup> was defined as a 5-log reduction in the 
 <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> transcript 
 <italic>(BCR-ABL1
  <sup>IS</sup>
 </italic> ≤0.001%), as described above. Undetectable molecular residual disease was defined as undetectable 
 <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> transcript with MR
 <sup>5</sup> (UMRD with MR
 <sup>5</sup>). At least 100,000 control genes (
 <italic>ABL1</italic>) were required for a sample to be considered as adequate.
