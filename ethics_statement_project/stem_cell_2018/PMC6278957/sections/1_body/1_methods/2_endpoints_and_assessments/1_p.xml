<p>The primary endpoint of the STAT2 trial was the 12-month TFR rate after discontinuing nilotinib treatment; secondary endpoints were the 24-month TFR rate after discontinuing nilotinib treatment, the 3-year treatment-free survival, and the MR
 <sup>4.5</sup> rate and time to MR
 <sup>4.5</sup> achieved by nilotinib in the re-treatment phase. Safety profiles, especially vascular adverse events in the consolidation phase or symptoms related to TKI withdrawal syndrome in the TFR phase, were evaluated.
