<p>In conclusion, although previous evidence regarding TFR after discontinuation of second-line nilotinib therapy is limited, our study suggests that a 2-year consolidation period of nilotinib therapy can safely induce higher TFR rates in patients with MR
 <sup>4.5</sup>. Thus, 2-year consolidation therapy with this agent may be an effective strategy for achieving TFR in large numbers of CML patients.
