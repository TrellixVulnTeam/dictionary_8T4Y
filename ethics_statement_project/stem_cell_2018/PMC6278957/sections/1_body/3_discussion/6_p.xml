<p>TKI withdrawal syndrome is the most common musculoskeletal pain-related adverse event in imatinib TFR studies, being first reported in the EURO-SKI trial.

 </sup> TKI withdrawal syndrome was detected in 11 patients in the TFR phase in this study. Rousselot 
 <italic>et al.</italic> suggested that prolonged inhibition of c-Kit signaling by imatinib may modulate nociceptive sensitivity, and that the sudden discontinuation of imatinib may reverse this phenomenon.

 </sup> As nilotinib targets the same tyrosine kinases as imatinib, including BCR-ABL kinase and c-Kit, albeit with differing potencies, nilotinib may also result in TKI withdrawal syndrome via the same mechanisms. Although TKI withdrawal syndrome was reported as an independent predictive factor for successful TFR by a Korean group,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="b26-1031835" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
 </sup> there was no significant relationship between TKI withdrawal syndrome and TFR identified in this nilotinib TFR study. However, because of the limited number of events during the TFR phase, univariate analysis is definitely limited in identifying a significant relationship between TKI withdrawal syndrome and TFR. Further examination with larger numbers of patients will be necessary to identify biomarkers for successful TFR.
