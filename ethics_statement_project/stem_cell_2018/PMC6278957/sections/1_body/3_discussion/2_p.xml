<p>Among 78 patients who entered the TFR phase, 53 remained in TFR in the first 12 months; the 12-month TFR primary endpoint was, therefore, 67.9% (95% CI: 56.4–78.1%). Although the TFR rate is higher than that in the STIM1 trial (41%; 95% CI: 29–52%), it is difficult to compare this result with those in other TFR studies with varying designs. Among 29 patients with a molecular recurrence, MR
 <sup>4.5</sup> was rapidly regained in 25 patients who were readministered nilotinib, and no patients progressed to accelerated phase or blast crisis CML in this study. Thus, our findings suggest that nilotinib therapy may allow the majority of patients to achieve successful TFR after discontinuation of nilotinib; this result is comparable to those of previous TFR studies with imatinib.
