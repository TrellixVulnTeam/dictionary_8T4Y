<p>Although the safety of nilotinib is generally regarded as being acceptable, vascular adverse events are an important concern in nilotinib therapy. The frequency of such events in this study was similar to the frequency in the nilotinib 300 mg twice daily arm in the ENESTnd trial.

 </sup> The incidence of vascular adverse events in patients treated with nilotinib 300 mg twice daily was estimated to be 2.8 per 100 patient-years in a meta-analysis.

 </sup> In the STAT2 trial, all patients with vascular adverse events, except one, either recovered or improved with intervention or supportive care after nilotinib discontinuation. Moreover, three patients achieved TFR after the occurrence of vascular adverse events during the TFR phase of STAT2. Since four of the six patients had at least one traditional risk factor for vascular adverse events, patients should be carefully screened for risk factors prior to nilotinib administration, with appropriate treatment or supportive care of comorbidities to avoid the development of vascular adverse events. After considering the risk of vascular adverse events in patients given consolidation with nilotinib, we conclude that this therapeutic agent can be safely administered to achieve a successful TFR in CML patients.
