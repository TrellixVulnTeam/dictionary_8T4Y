Successful treatment-free remission was defined as no confirmed loss of deep molecular response. We recruited 96 Japanese patients, of whom 78 sustained a deep molecular response during the consolidation phase and were therefore eligible to discontinue nilotinib in the treatment-free remission phase; of these, 53 patients (67.9%; 95% confidence interval: 56.4&#x02013;78.1%) remained free from molecular recurrence in the first 12 months. The estimated 3-year treatment-free survival was 62.8%. Nilotinib was readministered to all patients (n=29) who experienced a molecular recurrence during the treatment-free remission phase. After restarting treatment, rapid deep molecular response returned in 25 patients (86.2%), with 50% of patients achieving a deep molecular response within 3.5 months. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor withdrawal syndrome was reported in 11/78 patients during the early treatment-free remission phase. The treatment-free survival curve was significantly better in patients with undetectable molecular residual disease than in patients without (3-year treatment-free survival, 75.6 <italic>versus</italic> 48.6%, respectively; <italic>P</italic>=0.0126 by the log-rank test). There were no significant differences in treatment-free survival between subgroups based on tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment before the nilotinib consolidation phase, tyrosine kinase inhibitor-withdrawal syndrome, or absolute number of natural killer cells. The results of this study indicate that it is safe and feasible to stop tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who have achieved a sustained deep molecular response with 2 years of treatment with nilotinib.

In this trial, in contrast to the aforementioned studies, imatinib was replaced with nilotinib as the consolidation TKI therapy. However, the assessment of <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> and the definition of molecular recurrence in this trial are identical to those in the aforementioned studies.<sup><xref rid="b8-1031835" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10-1031835" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Nilotinib was administered instead of imatinib because previous studies had indicated that nilotinib could induce DMR in a greater number of patients than imatinib,<sup><xref rid="b1-1031835" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3-1031835" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> thereby potentially increasing the number of patients who achieve successful TFR.

Additionally, our retrospective study revealed that a DMR duration of at least 2 years was a significant predictive factor for successful TFR in Japanese CML patients.<sup><xref rid="b14-1031835" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Therefore, the treatment duration for this trial involved a consolidation phase of 2 years, and sustained DMR without loss of MR<sup>4.5</sup> was confirmed by regular <italic>BCR-ABL1<sup>IS</sup></italic> RQ-PCR testing for 2 years.</p><p>Among 78 patients who entered the TFR phase, 53 remained in TFR in the first 12 months; the 12-month TFR primary endpoint was, therefore, 67.9% (95% CI: 56.4&#x02013;78.1%). Although the TFR rate is higher than that in the STIM1 trial (41%; 95% CI: 29&#x02013;52%), it is difficult to compare this result with those in other TFR studies with varying designs. Among 29 patients with a molecular recurrence, MR<sup>4.5</sup> was rapidly regained in 25 patients who were readministered nilotinib, and no patients progressed to accelerated phase or blast crisis CML in this study. Thus, our findings suggest that nilotinib therapy may allow the majority of patients to achieve successful TFR after discontinuation of nilotinib; this result is comparable to those of previous TFR studies with imatinib.<sup><xref rid="b8-1031835" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10-1031835" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>In this study, the identified predictive factor for successful 12-month TFR was UMRD with MR<sup>5</sup> before discontinuation of nilotinib. In the EURO-SKI trial, there were no differences in MMR status at 6 months after treatment stop between depths of molecular response (MR<sup>4.5</sup>
<italic>versus</italic> no MR<sup>4.5</sup>).<sup><xref rid="b15-1031835" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> However, our finding suggests that a deeper MR favors successful achievement of TFR in CML patients, which is consistent with data from previous studies.<sup><xref rid="b16-1031835" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-1031835" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Among four patients without TFR in the late TFR phase, in whom MR<sup>4.5</sup> loss occurred at 16, 16, 17, and 20 months, three patients had MRD before entering the TFR phase. It is difficult to determine the quantity of <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> mRNA below MR<sup>4.5</sup>/MR<sup>5</sup> because of the sensitivity of IS-RQ-PCR.<sup><xref rid="b18-1031835" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> However, UMRD with MR<sup>5</sup> before TFR is one of the minimum requirements for TFR and the sustained duration of DMR might be a surrogate marker for the magnitude of the MR or the eradication of MRD during TKI treatment.<sup><xref rid="b19-1031835" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-1031835" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Meanwhile, 1-year consolidation with either dasatinib or nilotinib, which are both second-generation TKI, was proposed in the DADI trial<sup><xref rid="b11-1031835" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and the ENEStop study,<sup><xref rid="b21-1031835" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> respectively. Although the 1-year consolidation enabled identification of enrolled patients who had sustained MR<sup>4.5</sup> and were eligible to stop treatment,<sup><xref rid="b21-1031835" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> it is still unknown whether 1 year of consolidation with a second-generation TKI is sufficient to achieve DMR/UMRD below MR<sup>4.5</sup>/MR<sup>5</sup> for TFR.</p><p>Of the 96 patients in the safety analysis set, 78 achieved a sustained MR<sup>4.5</sup> on nilotinib consolidation and entered the TFR phase, including 33 patients (42.3%) who were treated with nilotinib following imatinib prior to enrollment in STAT2. Most patients (n=29, 72.5%) were switched from imatinib to nilotinib at the patients&#x02019; request prior to the trial, primarily to obtain a deeper and more sustained MR, despite not having imatinib resistance or intolerance. Similarly, the ENESTcmr study showed that a significant minority of patients who continued with imatinib therapy did later achieve DMR.<sup><xref rid="b4-1031835" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In the subanalysis evaluating prior TKI exposure, the 12-month TFR was almost identical between patients treated with only imatinib (62.5%) and those treated with nilotinib following imatinib (69.7%). This suggests that, regardless of the specific TKI, DMR is the first step for achieving successful TFR in patients with CML.</p><p>The proportion of natural killer cells in peripheral blood has been reported as a predictive marker, which might be related to a previously reported immuno-oncological effect.<sup><xref rid="b22-1031835" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23-1031835" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> However, it was beyond the remit of this trial to identify the significance of either the activity or the proportion or natural killer cells in peripheral blood.</p><p>TKI withdrawal syndrome is the most common musculoskeletal pain-related adverse event in imatinib TFR studies, being first reported in the EURO-SKI trial.<sup><xref rid="b24-1031835" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> TKI withdrawal syndrome was detected in 11 patients in the TFR phase in this study. Rousselot <italic>et al.</italic> suggested that prolonged inhibition of c-Kit signaling by imatinib may modulate nociceptive sensitivity, and that the sudden discontinuation of imatinib may reverse this phenomenon.<sup><xref rid="b25-1031835" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> As nilotinib targets the same tyrosine kinases as imatinib, including BCR-ABL kinase and c-Kit, albeit with differing potencies, nilotinib may also result in TKI withdrawal syndrome via the same mechanisms. Although TKI withdrawal syndrome was reported as an independent predictive factor for successful TFR by a Korean group,<sup><xref rid="b26-1031835" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> there was no significant relationship between TKI withdrawal syndrome and TFR identified in this nilotinib TFR study. However, because of the limited number of events during the TFR phase, univariate analysis is definitely limited in identifying a significant relationship between TKI withdrawal syndrome and TFR. Further examination with larger numbers of patients will be necessary to identify biomarkers for successful TFR.</p><p>Although the safety of nilotinib is generally regarded as being acceptable, vascular adverse events are an important concern in nilotinib therapy. The frequency of such events in this study was similar to the frequency in the nilotinib 300 mg twice daily arm in the ENESTnd trial.<sup><xref rid="b3-1031835" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The incidence of vascular adverse events in patients treated with nilotinib 300 mg twice daily was estimated to be 2.8 per 100 patient-years in a meta-analysis.<sup><xref rid="b27-1031835" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> In the STAT2 trial, all patients with vascular adverse events, except one, either recovered or improved with intervention or supportive care after nilotinib discontinuation. Moreover, three patients achieved TFR after the occurrence of vascular adverse events during the TFR phase of STAT2. Since four of the six patients had at least one traditional risk factor for vascular adverse events, patients should be carefully screened for risk factors prior to nilotinib administration, with appropriate treatment or supportive care of comorbidities to avoid the development of vascular adverse events. After considering the risk of vascular adverse events in patients given consolidation with nilotinib, we conclude that this therapeutic agent can be safely administered to achieve a successful TFR in CML patients.</p><p>In conclusion, although previous evidence regarding TFR after discontinuation of second-line nilotinib therapy is limited, our study suggests that a 2-year consolidation period of nilotinib therapy can safely induce higher TFR rates in patients with MR<sup>4.5</sup>. Thus, 2-year consolidation therapy with this agent may be an effective strategy for achieving TFR in large numbers of CML patients.</p></sec>
