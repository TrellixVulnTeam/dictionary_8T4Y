  <p>Pretransplant conditioning did not result in a pro-inflammatory environment in the skin at the time of transplantation. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> In normal skin, HLA class II-expressing cells and also T-cells are present scattered over the whole dermal region. In the epidermal layer, HLA class II-expressing cells were observed sporadically. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> In skin affected by dermatitis medicamentosa, dermal area count of HLA class II-expressing cells and T-cells is higher compared to normal skin. After non-myeloablative (NMA) conditioning 
   <bold>(C)</bold> and myeloablative (MA) conditioning 
   <bold>(D)</bold>, the presence of HLA class II-expressing cells and T-cells at the time of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) resembled the situation in normal skin. Dermal area counts with median were calculated for HLA class II-expressing cells 
   <bold>(E)</bold> and CD3 T-cells 
   <bold>(F)</bold> in skin biopsies of normal skin, skin at the time of alloSCT after NMA and MA conditioning, and skin affected by dermatitis medicamentosa. A significant difference was detected regarding HLA class II-expressing cells between normal skin and skin affected by dermatitis medicamentosa (Kruskal–Wallis test 
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.019, 
   <italic>post hoc</italic> Mann–Whitney 
   <italic>U</italic>-test p = 0.016). White line demarks the border between dermis and epidermis.
