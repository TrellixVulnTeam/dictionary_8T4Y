  <p>Gradual replacement of cells from recipient origin by cells of donor origin. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Percentage of recipient origin HLA class II-positive cells in the skin declined over time after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT), but remained present even after 24 weeks. After autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT), no mixed chimera were observed, and in biopsies taken at the time of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), the majority of HLA class II-positive cells were from donor origin. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Skin biopsy taken 3 weeks after alloSCT from a male patient with a female donor. All epithelial cells were XY, and nearly all HLA class II-positive cells were XY although some HLA class II-positive cells were XX (white arrows). 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Skin biopsy taken 24 weeks after alloSCT from a male patient with a female donor. All epithelial cells were XY and all HLA class II-positive cells in this part of the biopsy were XX (white arrows). 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Big differences were observed in the skin biopsies regarding the chimerism of CD3-positive cells. 
   <bold>(E)</bold> 3 weeks after alloSCT, nearly all CD3-positive cells were from patient origin, except those indicated with a white arrow (male patient with female donor). 
   <bold>(F)</bold> At the time of GVHD all CD3-positive cells were from donor origin (infiltrate of male donor CD3-positive cells in the skin of a female patient). White line demarks the border between dermis and epidermis.
