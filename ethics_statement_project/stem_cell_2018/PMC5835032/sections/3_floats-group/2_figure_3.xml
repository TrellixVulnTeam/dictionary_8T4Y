  <p>Biopsies from patients with acute skin graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) showed massive inflammation. Both dermal area count (excluding by definition the epidermal area count) of HLA class II-positive cells 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and CD3-positive cells 
   <bold>(B)</bold> were not significantly different between biopsies taken during acute skin GVHD and biopsies of normal skin taken 24 weeks after myeloablative (MA) allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). However, immunofluorescence microscopy showed honeycomb pattern of HLA class II expression on epidermal cells and upregulation of HLA class II expression on T-cells (yellow hued cells) during GVHD as signs of inflammation 
   <bold>(C)</bold>, while in normal skin biopsies 24 weeks after MA alloSCT, co-localization of HLA class II-positive cells and T-cells without interaction was observed 
   <bold>(D)</bold>. Pink hued cells represent CD8-positive CD3 T-cells. White line demarks the border between dermis and epidermis.
