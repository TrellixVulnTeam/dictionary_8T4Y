<p>To investigate whether cells were of patient or donor origin, XY-FISH was combined with surface immunofluorescent staining for biopsies taken from patients who had undergone a sex-mismatched transplantation. Directly after primary surface staining with CD3 or HLA-DR antibodies and secondary staining with the ALEXA antibodies, slides were digested for 3 min at 37°C with a pepsin solution (Dako; Code K5799) washed with PBS and postfixed with PBS containing 1% formaldehyde. After washing in PBS and dehydration in descending ethanol series, the slides were air dried. Subsequently, 10 µl probe mix containing CEP X (DXZ1) SpectrumGreen/CEP Y (DYZ3) SpectrumOrange (Abbot, Hoofddorp, Netherlands) was pipetted onto the slides, and denaturation was performed for 3 min at 80°C. Hybridization was performed overnight in a humid chamber at 37°C and after two washing steps (SCC/0.05% Tween and 0.4× SCC at 72°C for 3 min) and dehydration, slides were coverslipped with vectashield containing a nuclear stain (DAPI).</p>
