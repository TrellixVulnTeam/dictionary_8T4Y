<p>To investigate the pro-inflammatory environment in the skin at various time points after transplantation, 4-µm cryopreserved sections were cut, dried for 1 h at 60°C followed by 30 min at room temperature, and fixated in acetone for 10 min. Immunohistochemical staining was performed overnight at room temperature using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against CD3 (IgG2a, Ps1-ab699, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and CD8 (IgG2b, 4B11, Leica Microsystems, Rijswijk, Netherlands) as markers for T-cell infiltration in the skin and against HLA class II (IgG1, p104630, Dako, Heverlee, Belgium), HLA-DR (IgG2b, B8.11.2), and CD54 (IgG1, ab20, Abcam) as markers for activated cells. To investigate whether HLA class II-positive cells in skin biopsies were resident dermal dendritic cells (DCs), inflammatory dermal DC, or dermal macrophages, staining with MoAb against CD1c (IgG1, MCA694, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Veenendaal, Netherlands), CD11c (IgG1, B-Ly6, BD, Breda, Netherlands), CD40 (IgG1, 5C3, BD), CD54 (IgG1, ab20, Abcam), CD86 (IgG1, ab23556, Abcam), CD206 (IgG1, 19.2, BD), and CD209 (IgG1, AZM D1, BD) was performed. Afterward, slides were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary fluorescently labeled goat-anti-mouse IgG2a ALEXA 546 (red), IgG2b ALEXA 647 (blue), and IgG1 ALEXA 488 (green) (Alexa, Invitrogen, Breda, Netherlands) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin. After washing, slides were covered with Mowiol 4-88 (Sigma Aldrich), and images were captured by confocal laser scanning microscope LSM510 (Zeiss, Sliedrecht, Netherlands).</p>
