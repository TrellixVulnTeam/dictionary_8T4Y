<p>The NMA conditioning regimen preceding HLA identical alloSCT consisted of fludarabine (50 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> orally from days −10 to −5), busulfan (0.8 mg/kg iv four times a day on days −7 and −6), and alemtuzumab (15 mg iv on days −4 and −3). In case of a matched unrelated donor (MUD), patients were also treated with antithymocyte globulin (thymoglobulin, 1 mg/kg on day −2). MA conditioning consisted of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg iv on days −6 and −5) and TBI (9 Gy on day −1) in case of an HLA identical sibling donor. In case of an MUD, alemtuzumab (15 mg on days −5 and −6) and cyclosporine A (starting 1.5 mg/kg twice a day with tapering to 0 in 3 months) was given as GVHD prophylaxis. Stem cell grafts were T-cell depleted by addition of 20 mg alemtuzumab to the bag before administration (
