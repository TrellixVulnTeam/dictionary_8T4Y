<p>Quantification of labeled cells in the dermis was done using Image J (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) by measuring the dermal area count, which is a calculation of the percentage of the area taken by the labeled cells as a part of the total dermal area in the biopsy as described before (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Computer-assisted calculations were done to estimate the percentage of colored area in respect to the total area of a part of the biopsy. Dermal area count of at least two fields of 521µm × 521 µm per biopsy was measured. Only labeled cells in the dermis were counted, and labeled cells in the epidermis were excluded from the calculation. Mean dermal area counts of HLA class II- and CD3-positive cells in skin biopsies were calculated at different time points and conditioning regimens after autoSCT, NMA, and MA alloSCT. Kruskal–Wallis test was performed to compare median dermal area counts, and in case the null hypothesis, being no differences in medians between different groups, could be rejected,

 <italic>U</italic>-test was performed to compare dermal area counts between two specific groups and significance was accepted as
