<p>After initial profound TCD, relatively high-dose DLI is required from 6 months after alloSCT to induce GVHD. In contrast, infusion of a tenfold lower dose after 3 months has already a significant risk of induction of GVHD (

It has been hypothesized that, due to tissue damage caused by the conditioning regimen, an inflammatory environment with activated APC in the skin during the hematologic and immunologic reconstitution would be the primary initiation of this response. However, our results illustrate that tissue damage is unlikely to be sufficient to create an environment for induction of an alloreactive immune response. Although tissue damage can result in the release of cytokines, this does not result in costimulatory molecule expressing activated APC able to appropriate present recipient-derived antigens to donor T-cells. This is in concordance with previous findings that, under non-inflammatory conditions, non-hematopoietic tissues are not highly susceptible to GVHD reactivity of alloreactive T-cells due to their inability to establish high avidity interactions (
