<p>Although in concordance with previous studies, which illustrated HLA class II expression in skin biopsies after alloSCT in the absence of GVHD and T-cells infiltrating the skin with upregulation of HLA class II on non-hematopoietic cells occurring during GVHD (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), our findings give novel insights. First, the HLA class II-positive cells detected after alloSCT in the absence of GVHD turned out not to be APC, but macrophages. High expression of CD206 on HLA class II-positive cells was found, which is predominantly present on macrophages playing a role in later stages of tissue repair in the skin and in the remodeling phase (

Second, an increase in T-cells after MA alloSCT in the absence of GVHD was observed without inflammation or interaction with the HLA class II-positive cells. This may be explained by the presence of regulatory T-cells or γδ T-cells known to be involved in tissue repair or T-cells present for the purpose of immune surveillance (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). We observed an increase in tissue repairing macrophages only after TBI containing MA and not after other conditioning regimens, indicating that TBI probably is the main contributor to the tissue damage. Although no inflammation or interaction between macrophages and T-cells was observed after MA alloSCT in the absence of GVHD, the increased presence of HLA class II-positive macrophages may result in higher susceptibility to an immune response in case subsequent DLI is administered.
