<p>Despite the lack of activated APC in the skin, there are several other explanations for the observed occurrence of GVHD induced by postponed application of DLI 3–6 months after TCD alloSCT. First, the alloreactive immune response can be initiated in interaction with activated APC outside the skin, followed by the release of an abundance of T-cell stimulating cytokines, upregulation of costimulatory molecules on APC and amplification of the immune response in the skin. Alternatively, an immune response to viral or bacterial infections can result in the cascade of events inducing an immune response with coinciding GVHD (

Although for the initiation of an alloreactive immune response from naive donor T-cells APC are required, memory donor T-cells directed against a mismatched HLA class II molecule do not need acti-vation by APC. We previously demonstrated the occurrence of skin GVHD after the infusion of purified donor CD4 T-cells 3 months after transplantation in patients who are HLA 10/10 matched but mismatched compared to their donor regarding HLA-DP (
