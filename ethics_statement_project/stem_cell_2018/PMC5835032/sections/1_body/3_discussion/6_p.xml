<p>In summary, after NMA conditioning, there is no increase in HLA class II-positive cells and T-cells in the skin. TBI containing MA conditioning results in a significant increase in HLA class II-positive macrophages without APC phenotype and an increase in T-cells without activation, in the absence of interaction with each other. It is unlikely that these cells can directly initiate an alloreactive immune response in the skin. If there is an HLA class II mismatch between patient and donor, dermal macrophages may be responsible for the induction of an immune response by memory T-cells in the skin. Otherwise, initiation of an alloreactive immune response is likely to be dependent on primary events outside of the skin.</p>
