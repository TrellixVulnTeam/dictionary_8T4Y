<p>The results of our study illustrate that there is a gradual replacement of patient macrophages in the skin by donor macrophages, which is concordant with previous findings by others (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The observation that HLA class II-positive macrophages of patient origin remain present in the skin for at least 6â€‰months after alloSCT has to be taken into account in the risk assessment of administration of DLI post alloSCT, especially in the administration of donor T-cells in case of an HLA class II mismatch between patient and donor.
