<p>Our data illustrate that the conditioning regimen before alloSCT did not directly cause an inflammatory environment in the skin at the day of infusion of the stem cell graft. In the absence of GVHD, after hematologic recovery following TBI containing MA alloSCT, HLA class II-positive macrophages, but not cells with a phenotype of professional APC were recruited to the dermal region of the skin. These HLA class II-positive macrophages are most probably involved in repairing tissue damage. T-cells were also recruited to the dermal area, but did not show activation or interaction with the HLA class II-positive cells. In contrast, after conditioning regimens lacking TBI, no increase in dermal macrophages or T-cells was observed during the phase of hematologic and immunologic recovery. In the absence of GVHD, patient chimerism of dermal HLA class II-positive cells gradually changed over time to a median of 23% at 6â€‰months after alloSCT, but patient-derived HLA class II-positive cells remained detectable. Skin affected by GVHD also contained high number of T-cells and HLA class II-expressing cells, but with an activated APC phenotype. In these biopsies, strong interactions between APC and T-cells were seen, coincided by the activation of T-cells and local inflammation resulting in upregulation of HLA class II molecules also on epidermal cells. Probably due to destruction of recipient-derived APC by donor T-cells during GVHD, these biopsies only contained APC of donor origin.</p>
