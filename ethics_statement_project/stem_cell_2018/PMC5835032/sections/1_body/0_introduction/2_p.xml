<p>In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that activated APCs are present for several months in the skin due to tissue damage caused by the conditioning regimen given before alloSCT. Since beside the conditioning regimen, T-cells administered at the time of alloSCT can contribute to inflammation with the presence of activated APC due to GVHD or immune responses against pathogens, it is not possible to investigate this hypothesis after T-cell replete alloSCT. Therefore, we investigated the presence of activated APC in the skin in the absence of an alloimmune response at several time points after TCD alloSCT. We illustrate that there is no increase in HLA class II-positive cells or T-cell influx at the time of alloSCT, regardless of the type of conditioning regimen. Total body irradiation (TBI) containing myeloablative (MA) conditioning, but not non-myeloablative (NMA) conditioning or conditioning preceding autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT), resulted in dermal recruitment of HLA class II-positive tissue repairing macrophages, most prominent in the period of immune reconstitution 12–24 weeks after alloSCT with co-localization of T-cells, but without inflammatory interaction. In the absence of an alloimmune response, as expected, the percentage of HLA class II-positive dermal macrophages of recipient origin decreased gradually over time after alloSCT, while percentage of HLA class II-positive dermal macrophages from donor origin increased.</p>
