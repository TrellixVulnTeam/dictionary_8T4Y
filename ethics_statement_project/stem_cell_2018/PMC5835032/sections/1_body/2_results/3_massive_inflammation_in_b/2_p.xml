<p>Dermal area counts of HLA class II-expressing cells and CD3 T-cells were not significantly different in biopsies taken from patients during acute skin GVHD compared to biopsies taken from patients without GVHD 24 weeks after MA alloSCT (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A,B). Of note, the epidermal area was excluded in the dermal area count calculations. However, major differences were observed between biopsies taken during GVHD or 24 weeks after MA alloSCT in the absence of GVHD. First, in biopsies taken from affected skin during GVHD, localized induction of HLA class II expression in a honeycomb pattern became visible in the epidermal layer (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C), illustrating upregulation of HLA class II expression on epidermal keratinocytes as a result of inflammation. This phenomenon was not observed in skin without GVHD where the presence of HLA class II-positive cells remained limited to the dermal region (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D). Second, in GVHD biopsies, the T-cells showed overt upregulation of HLA class II expression, illustrating activation of these T-cells. Skin without GVHD showed an increase in both HLA class II-positive cells and T-cells, but without signs of interaction or upregulation of HLA class II expression on the T-cells, indicating that the HLA class II-expressing cells did not function as APCs for the T-cells present (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C,D).
