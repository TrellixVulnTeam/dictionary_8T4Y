<p>To investigate whether the observed dermal macrophages with non-professional APC phenotype after alloSCT were of patient or donor origin, XY-FISH combined with staining of HLA class II was performed after alloSCT from patients with a gender-mismatched donor. Skin biopsies taken from patients after auto-SCT were used as negative controls. After alloSCT, a gradual decline of the percentages of patient-derived HLA class II-positive cells was observed, and HLA class II-positive cells of patient origin were replaced by cells of donor origin. However, even 24 weeks after alloSCT, HLA class II-positive cells of patient origin could be detected in the skin (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A–C). In the first 3–6 weeks after transplantation, in the absence of GVHD dermal T-cells were found to be predominantly of patient origin, whereas from 12 weeks after transplantation, a mixture of patient- and donor-derived T-cells was found. As expected, biopsies taken from the affected skin during active GVHD showed massive infiltration of donor T-cells (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D–F).
