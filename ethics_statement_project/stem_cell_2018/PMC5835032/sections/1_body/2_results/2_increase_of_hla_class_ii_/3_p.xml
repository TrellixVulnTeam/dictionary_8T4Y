<p>These data illustrate that after NMA alloSCT, in the absence of GVHD, no change in numbers of HLA class II-expressing cells or CD3 cells occurred. However, 12–24 weeks after MA alloSCT, despite the absence of any sign of GVHD, there was a significant increase in HLA class II-positive cells in the dermal region of the skin as well as an increase in T-cells after 24 weeks. Despite this increase, no signs of inflammation or interaction between the HLA class II-positive cells and the T-cells were detected, because T-cells appeared not to be activated illustrated by the lack of expression of HLA class II.</p>
