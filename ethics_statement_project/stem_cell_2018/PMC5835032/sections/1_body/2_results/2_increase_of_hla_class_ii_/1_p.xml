<p>To analyze the activation status of dermal cells early after alloSCT and after hematopoietic reconstitution in the absence of an allogeneic immune response, we substantiated the amount of HLA class II-expressing cells and T-cells in skin biopsies taken during hematopoietic recovery (3 and 6 weeks after transplantation) and during the period of immune reconstitution (12 and 24 weeks after transplantation) by dermal area count calculation. Patients were selected not to have GVHD of the skin. Biopsies taken at various time points after transplantation were compared to biopsies taken at the day of transplantation (
