<p>In the skin biopsies taken after autoSCT, no increase in HLA class II-expressing cells or T-cells was observed within the first 24 week after transplantation (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A,B). No increase in HLA class II-expressing cells or CD3 T-cells was found after NMA alloSCT (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C,D). In contrast, after MA alloSCT, a significant increase (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.020, Kruskal–Wallis test) in HLA class II-expressing cells in the dermis was observed from median 2.1% of dermal region at the time of alloSCT to 12.9% at 12 weeks after alloSCT (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.03, 
 <italic>post hoc</italic> Mann–Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic>-test) and to 16.5% at 24 weeks after alloSCT (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.008, 
 <italic>post hoc</italic> Mann–Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic>-test) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>E). In addition, the numbers of T-cells appeared to increase within the first 24 weeks after MA alloSCT from a median of 0.83% of the dermal region at time of alloSCT to 4.6% at 24 weeks after alloSCT, although this increase did not reach statistical significance (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.12, Kruskal–Wallis test) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>F). The immunofluorescence microscopic pictures in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>G–I illustrate the presence of HLA class II-expressing cells and CD3 T-cells in biopsies taken 24 weeks after autoSCT, NMA, and MA alloSCT, respectively.
