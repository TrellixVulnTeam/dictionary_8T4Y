<p>To determine the nature of the increased numbers of HLA class II-positive cells observed in the dermal region of the skin during immune reconstitution following MA transplantation, expression of CD1c, CD11c, CD40, CD54, CD86, and CD206 (mannose receptor) was measured, since these markers allow distinction of different subsets of dermal APC (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Biopsies of normal skin (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2), skin 24 weeks after MA alloSCT (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) and skin affected by GVHD (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) were analyzed. The majority of HLA class II-expressing cells in normal skin was found to be macrophages, as indicated by the expression of CD68 on HLA class II-positive cells and expression of CD206 on HLA class II-positive cells, while also resident dermal DCs (CD11c and HLA class II-positive) could be detected. The HLA class II-positive cells did not show expression of costimulatory markers such as CD40, CD54, or CD86 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). Similar to normal skin, the majority of HLA class II-expressing cells found in skin biopsies taken after MA alloSCT in the absence of GVHD appeared to be macrophages (HLA class II-positive cells were expressing CD68-and HLA class II-positive cells were expressing CD206) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B) that did not harbor the phenotype of resident or inflammatory dermal DCs illustrated by the absence of CD11c expression. This observation was identical for the HLA class II-positive cells found in skin of patients irrespective of the conditioning regimen and time point after transplantation. In accordance, these HLA class II-positive cells did not express costimulatory molecules CD40, CD54, or CD86 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B).
