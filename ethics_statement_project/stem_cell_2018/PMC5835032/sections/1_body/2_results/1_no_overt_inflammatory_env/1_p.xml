<p>To investigate whether conditioning before alloSCT results in an inflammatory environment in the skin coinciding with increased expression of HLA class II molecules and attraction of T-cells, the quantitative presence of HLA class II- or CD3-expressing cells in the dermal layer was substantiated by dermal area count calculation in skin biopsies taken from patients at the time of the transplantation following NMA or MA conditioning and compared to normal skin biopsies. As shown in a representative example in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A, in normal control skin biopsies, HLA class II-expressing cells were present scattered over the dermal region and showed mainly a clustering pattern around the vascular and follicular structures. In the epidermal layer, HLA class II-expressing cells were only sporadically observed. In control skin biopsies of inflamed skin from patients with dermatitis medicamentosa, an increase in HLA class II-expressing cells was observed, scattered over the dermal and epidermal layer (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). Analysis of biopsies taken directly after pretransplant conditioning at the day of transplantation revealed no clear increase in the number of HLA class II-expressing cells. The scattered pattern of HLA class II-expressing cells strongly resembled the situation in normal skin, as illustrated by the depicted representative examples for each type of conditioning in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C,D. To substantiate the amount of HLA class II expression in the different biopsies, dermal area counts were calculated. A significant increase in HLA class II-expressing cells was observed in skin biopsies of dermatitis medicamentosa compared to normal skin (Kruskal–Wallis test 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.019, 
 <italic>post hoc</italic> Mann–Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic>-test 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.016). HLA class II-expressing cells were not increased in biopsies taken at the day of transplant after NMA or MA conditioning (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E).
