<p>In normal skin, both CD4 (defined as CD3-positive CD8-negative cells) and CD8 T-cells were found scattered over the dermis without signs of clustering or co-expression of HLA class II (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A), indicating a non-activated status of these T-cells. In case of dermatitis medicamentosa, an increase in T-cells (Kruskal–Wallis test 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.058) was observed in some, but not in all biopsies (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B,F). These T-cells were not activated as illustrated by the lack of co-expression of HLA class II molecules. No significant increase in the percentages of T-cells in the skin at the day of transplantation was observed, irrespective of the type of conditioning (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>F). These data show that neither NMA nor MA conditioning regimen resulted in increased numbers of HLA class II-expressing cells or attraction of T-cells in the skin at the day of alloSCT.
