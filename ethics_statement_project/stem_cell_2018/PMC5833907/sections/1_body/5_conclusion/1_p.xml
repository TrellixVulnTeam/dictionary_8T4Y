<p id="Par47">In this study we have developed and validated an online Bayesian network to assess the ability of the initial cyclosporine blood concentration to be in the therapeutic interval after pediatric HSCT. This model allows the simulation of different dosing regimens, finding the best to enable the right cyclosporine residual concentration to be reached immediately after transplantation, minimizing the risk of adverse effects and GVHD occurrence. The characteristics of this model are satisfactory but external multicentric validation is needed before its use in clinical practice.</p>
