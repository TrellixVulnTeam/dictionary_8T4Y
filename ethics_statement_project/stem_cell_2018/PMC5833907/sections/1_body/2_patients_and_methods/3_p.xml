<p id="Par14">Six patients were excluded from the study as they were given cyclosporine for several weeks before transplantation or took it orally. Fourteen relevant variables that could have possibly influenced cyclosporine concentrations after the first dose post-transplantation were recorded: death, sex, weight, post-transplant day, age, mean dose before measurement, last dose before measurement, HSCT indication, documented infection or not, drugs interacting with cyclosporine, cholestasis, C-reactive protein (CRP) above 15 mg/L, mean hemoglobin, and mean creatinine (see Fig.
