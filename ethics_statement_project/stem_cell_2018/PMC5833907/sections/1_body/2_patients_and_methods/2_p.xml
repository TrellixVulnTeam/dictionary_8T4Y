<p id="Par13">Clinical and biological data were collected from the day of graft infusion to 2 months after transplantation in 155 pediatric patients undergoing HSCT both for malignant and non-malignant diseases between 2008 and 2016. Cyclosporine was given via a 2-h infusion twice daily, initially 3 mg/kg for malignant diseases and 5 mg/kg for non-malignant diseases, starting the day before HSCT. The first measure of cyclosporine trough concentration was performed on whole blood around the third day after the graft infusion (D + 3) (varying between day 0 [D0] and the seventh day after graft infusion [D + 7]; median D + 3; 83.2% of measurements taken on D + 3).</p>
