<p id="Par42">The first studies only took into account the serum creatinine and the trough blood cyclosporine concentration when adapting the cyclosporine dosing regimen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], but complex models taking into account many covariates such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, hepatic functions (through bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase [ALAT], aspartate aminotransferase [ASAT], albumin), and creatinine have been developed in more recent years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. However, to date, our model is the first to include so many variables at the same time to predict the achievement of the cyclosporine therapeutic index soon after HSCT. Moreover, the role of inflammation on cytochromes, notably CYP3A4, and subsequent inhibition of metabolism of drugs such as cyclosporine is well-known [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Inflammatory episodes are frequently associated with HSCT, for example post-transplant infections. Consequently, the inclusion of inflammation parameters in the model is relevant. Nevertheless, our study is the first to take some of these parameters into account.
