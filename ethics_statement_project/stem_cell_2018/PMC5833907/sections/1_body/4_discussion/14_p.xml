<p id="Par41">Over the past 50 years HSCT has been a huge progress in medicine, and consequently TDM of immunosuppressants became a great concern. As cyclosporine is the main immunosuppressant used after HSCT, many researchers have worked on the link between the concentration of cyclosporine and the onset of GVHD [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Malard et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] have shown that trough blood cyclosporine concentrations during the first week after HSCT were correlated with the onset of grade III–IV acute GVHD, but no increase in overall survival was found. However, in this study, the cyclosporine target concentrations were high, inhibiting a possible GVL effect, and exposing patients to cyclosporine adverse effects [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] also found this trend in a pediatric population. In this way, our model could be useful, allowing the therapeutic interval to be reached early after HSCT, and it could be evaluated for its use in improving the onset of moderate acute GVHD in malignant diseases (optimizing the GVL effect) or decreasing the rate of severe GVHD in non-malignant diseases.
