<p id="Par28">In our pediatric population undergoing HSCT who were receiving cyclosporine to prevent GVHD, TAN Bayesian network was the best method to predict whether the initial cyclosporine concentration after HSCT will be in the therapeutic range. The therapeutic range of the cyclosporine blood concentration rather than cyclosporine blood concentration itself was chosen as the endpoint because it seemed the most clinically relevant and simplest to handle for clinicians while using an online Bayesian network. This tool will allow them to find the best cyclosporine dosing regimen to reach the therapeutic interval right after transplantation, using a simple method, provided that further external validation is satisfactory.</p>
