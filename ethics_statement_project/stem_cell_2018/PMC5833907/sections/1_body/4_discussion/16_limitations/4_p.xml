<p id="Par46">Another limitation is the therapeutic range of cyclosporine considered in our study. Indeed, therapeutic cyclosporine blood concentration target ranges have been set only according to the graft indication, since the concentration of interest was the first one after transplantation. If a longer period after HSCT is considered, occurrence of GVHD and other target cyclosporine concentration values will have to be taken into account. Moreover, Jacobson et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] have shown that the number of days post-transplant influences cyclosporine pharmacokinetics, which is why it would probably be interesting to develop a model covering a larger duration after HSCT in order to take into account the intra-individual variability of cyclosporine pharmacokinetics.
