<p id="Par26">The results of the analysis of sensitivity to findings that was performed on the synthetic population are shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The most relevant variables that could influence whether the initial residual blood cyclosporine concentration was in the therapeutic range were the last dose before measurement, the mean dose before measurement, and the day of blood sampling after HSCT. Some variables were required for the prediction and could not be derived from other ones. This was especially the case for interacting drugs, mean hemoglobin, and mean creatinine, whereas a missing weight could adequately be replaced by information on the last administered dose, mean dose before measurement, age versus CYP3A4 maturation, mean hemoglobin, and mean creatinine versus age category.
