<p id="Par21">Of the 155 patients in total, six were excluded as they were given cyclosporine for several weeks before HSCT or they took cyclosporine orally. Forty-four patients were also excluded from the generation of synthetic data due to one or several missing data at the time of blood sampling for the initial determination of the cyclosporine residual blood concentration following HSCT. A final total of 105 patients without missing data at this time were retained (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The characteristics of the 105 patients are summarized in Table
