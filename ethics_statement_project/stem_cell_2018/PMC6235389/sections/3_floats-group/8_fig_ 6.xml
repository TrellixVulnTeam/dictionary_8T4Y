  <p>Target neck lymph node lesion in a 54-year-old man (staged with T3N3M0) treated with famitinib (12.5 mg) and CCRT: clinical example of stable disease (SD) according to RECIST (version 1.1.). 
   <bold>a</bold> Contrast-enhanced ultrasound with a strong vascularized lesion (arrow) and corresponding time intensity curve at baseline. 
   <bold>b</bold> The metastatic neck lymph node lesion was evident in the axial T2-weighted MRI image at baseline (arrow). 
   <bold>c</bold> Fourteen days after the onset of famitinib alone treatment, D-CEUS revealed an increase in tumour vascularity density with a slight change in the tumour perfusion parameters, as shown by contrast enhancement pattern and corresponding time-intensity curves. 
   <bold>d</bold> The longest diameter of the metastatic neck lymph node lesion did not change in the axial T2-weighted MRI images at D15 (arrow). 
   <bold>e</bold> Time-intensity curves of tumour enhancement at baseline (blue curve), on D8 (red curve) and on day 15 (green curve). It was possible to observe an increased maximum enhancement and higher area under the enhancement curve at D8 early after treatment. 
   <bold>f</bold> The metastatic neck lymph node lesion disappeared after the completion of CCRT and famitinib treatment (arrow), but the patients exhibited liver metastasis (
   <bold>g</bold>, arrow) at 11 months after complete treatment
