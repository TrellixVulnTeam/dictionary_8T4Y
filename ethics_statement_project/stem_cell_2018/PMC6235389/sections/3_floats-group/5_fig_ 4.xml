  <p>Target neck lymph node lesion in a 43-year-old woman (staged with T2N2M0) treated with famitinib (20 mg) and CCRT: clinical example of the partial response (PR) according to RECIST (version 1.1.). 
   <bold>a</bold> Contrast-enhanced ultrasound with a strong vascularized lesion (arrow) and corresponding time intensity curve at baseline. 
   <bold>b</bold> The metastatic neck lymph node lesion was evident in the axial T2-weighted MRI image at baseline (arrow). 
   <bold>c</bold> Fourteen days after the onset of famitinib alone treatment, D-CEUS revealed an increase in tumour necrosis with a drastic reduction of the tumour perfusion parameters, as shown by the contrast enhancement pattern and corresponding time-intensity curve. 
   <bold>d</bold> The longest diameter of the metastatic neck lymph node lesion greatly regressed in the axial T2-weighted MRI image at D15 (arrow). 
   <bold>e</bold> Time-intensity curves of tumour enhancement at baseline (blue curve), on D8 (red curve) and on D15 (green curve). It was possible to observe a reduced maximum enhancement and lower area under the enhancement curve early after treatment. 
   <bold>f</bold>, 
   <bold>g</bold> The metastatic neck lymph node lesion disappeared after the completion of CCRT and famitinib treatment (arrow) and conformed 3 months later (arrow). The patient was disease-free after long-term follow-up
