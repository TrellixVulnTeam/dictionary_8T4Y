<p id="Par25">Thirteen (65.0%) patients achieved CR and seven (35.0%) patients achieved PR at the completion of CCRT, and 19 (95%) patients achieved CR at 3 months after treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e). One patient, who had a residual neck lymph node that was evaluated 9 months after CCRT, subsequently underwent selective neck dissection. Five patients developed distant organ metastasis during 3 years of follow-up. After a median follow-up of 44 months, the 1-, 2-, and 3-year PFS was 85%, 70% and 70%, respectively. Additionally, the 1-, 2-, and 3-year DMFS was 90%, 75% and 75%, respectively (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S4). All five metastatic patients received palliative chemotherapy, and three patients were currently alive and two patients died.
