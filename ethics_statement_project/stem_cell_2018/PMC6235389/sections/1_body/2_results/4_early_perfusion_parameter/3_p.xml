<p id="Par28">The percentage changes in dynamic functional parameters stratified by progression are shown in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3. The percentage changes in PI, AUC, PW and WIPI at day 0, 8 and 15 were significantly different between patients with and without progression. Furthermore, patients with a perfusion parameter response of less than 30% after taking famitinib for 1 week had a high risk of disease progression (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S4), suggesting that patients with disease progression had smaller percentage changes in perfusion parameters and were not sensitive to famitinib. Typical clinical examples of the corresponding contrast uptake time-intensity curves for patients with progression at each time point after treatment are shown in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and
