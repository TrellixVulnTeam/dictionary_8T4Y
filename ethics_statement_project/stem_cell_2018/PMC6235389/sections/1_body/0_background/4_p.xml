<p id="Par8">Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors with multiple targets are also promising for NPC treatment. Expression of the c-kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) has been detected in NPC tissues, cell lines and tumour xenografts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In preclinical models, RTK inhibitors, such as sunitinib, demonstrated encouraging results in NPC [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A phase II trial demonstrated significant responses in recurrent or metastatic NPC patients treated with sunitinib [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, the trial was terminated due to haemorrhagic events occurred in 69% of the patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Therefore, new multi-target RTK inhibitors with acceptable safety profiles are needed for NPC.
