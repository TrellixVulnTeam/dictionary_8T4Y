  <p>Flow diagram: the preparation of SF/CS and ADSCs seeded SF/CS. Silk fibroin and chitosan blend (SF/CS) film were cut into 1.5-centimeter-diameter circles before implantation. SF/CS film appears light yellow, transparent and slightly uneven surface. Fluorescence microscope showing immunofluorescence staining of CM-Dil labeled ADSCs (red) in SF/CS film (100Ã—). The nuclei (blue) were then counterstained with 4',6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole, Dihydrochloride (DAPI).</p>
