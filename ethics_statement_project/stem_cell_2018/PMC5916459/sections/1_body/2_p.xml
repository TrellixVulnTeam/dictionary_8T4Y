<p>In recent years, silk fibroins (SF), an attractive natural fibrous protein, have good biocompatibility, are safe, have slow degradability, and have remarkable mechanical properties which are proven in many previous studies.

 </sup> Silk fibroin has been investigated for surgical implantation, wound healing, and in tissue engineering of bone, cartilage, tendon, and ligament tissues owing to its biocompatibility, relatively low thrombogenicity, relatively low thrombogenicity, low inflammatory response, degradation kinetics, high tensile strength with flexibility, and permeability to oxygen and water.

 </sup> Silk fibroin in various formats (films, fibers, nets, meshes, membranes, yarns, and sponges) has been shown to support stem cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation in vitro and promote tissue repair in vivo.
