<p>Engrafted CM-Dil–labeled cells were identified throughout the various substrata of the dermis and cutaneous appendages at 7, 14, 21 days postoperatively (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Engrafted ADSCs were identified, on the basis of red CM-Dil signal, at 14 days, engrafted cells were seen incorporated into winding linear structures consistent with microvascular elements and coexpressing positive signals for red CM-Dil and the endothelial marker CD31 (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>I). Some engrafted ADSCs were noted as recapitulating elements of linear vascular structures, costaining for the vascular smooth muscle marker α-SMA (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>II) and CM-Dil. However, red fluorescence-labeled cells were not observed to be incorporated into regenerated epidermalepithelium. At 21 days, in addition to these findings described, engrafted Dil-positive cells were observed to be incorporated as components of the regenerated epidermal epithelium on the basis of red fluorescence-labeled cells costaining for the cytokeratin marker of epidermal epithelium cytokeratin 10 (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>III).
