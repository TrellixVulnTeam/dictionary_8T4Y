<p>Histological examination showed that there was no obvious difference among the 3 groups but significantly higher epithelialization rate, increased granulation tissue formulation, and capillary formation when compared with groups A and B in days 7 and 21(Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>II). There were more blood vessels (allows), growing perpendicular to the wound, and less inflammatory cell in the wound granulation tissue than the other groups by day 7 (neovascularization, A &gt; B &gt; C; inflammatory cell, A &lt; B &lt; C). In day 21 after postwound healing, the images showed that the tissue of the wound which was grafted in the ADSCs-SF/CS almost regenerate close to the normal tissue. There still appear some neovascularization, inflammatory cell, and collagen that have not disappeared yet in the 2 other groups, especially control group.
