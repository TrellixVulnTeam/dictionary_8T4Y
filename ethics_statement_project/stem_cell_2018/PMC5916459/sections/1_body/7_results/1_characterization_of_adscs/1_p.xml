<p>Adipose-derived stem cells were initially expanded for 3 passages and later characterized by cell differentiation and immunophenotyping assays. The cultures were observed by using an inverted light microscope. Attachment of spindle-shaped cells to tissue culture plastic flask was observed after 1 day of culture of ADSCs. Primary cultures reached 70% to 80% confluence in approximately 5 to 6 days. During the passaging, cell growth tended to accelerate and morphology of cells changed gradually. Cells become more flat-shape with increase in passage number. After 3 passages, cultured cells displayed typical fibroblastoid morphology (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>I) and under appropriate stimuli, exhibited potential for adipocyte and osteocyte differentiation demonstrated through Oil Red (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>II), Alizarin red staining (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>III). Cells also expressed characteristic stem cell markers, CD29 and CD90, and were negative for CD45 (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>IVâ€“VI).
