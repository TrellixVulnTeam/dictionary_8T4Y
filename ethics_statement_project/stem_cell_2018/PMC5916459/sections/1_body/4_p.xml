 </sup> In tissue engineering, CS can be generalized to a variety of soft tissue repairs because it has also been shown to have wound-healing properties, is nontoxic, and has minimal foreign body response with accelerated angiogenesis.

 </sup> The blend of SF with CS could facilitate the electrospinning process and allows the well-known structural features of SF to benefit from the surface chemistry of CS to result in a scaffold with features ideal for cell attachment and population of the substratum.
