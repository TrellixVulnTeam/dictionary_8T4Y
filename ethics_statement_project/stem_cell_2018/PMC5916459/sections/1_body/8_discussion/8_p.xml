<p>In this study, the contraction of the wound surface was reflected by measuring the length of epithelial crawling and epithelial gap. It can be seen from the histogram that the length of epithelial crawling of ADSC-SF/CS grafted wound is significantly longer than a simple SF/CS grafted wound. This reflects that the fibroblast activity of ADSCs promote wound contraction when analyzed combined with the rate of wound contraction (Figs.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).
