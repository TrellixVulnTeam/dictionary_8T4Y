<p>In this study, ADSC-SF/CS wound treatment resulted in significantly increased amounts of EGF, TGF-β, and VEGF in the wounds. Vascular endothelial growth factor plays a key role in angiogenesis by stimulating endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and organization into tubules. Moreover, VEGF increases circulating endothelial progenitor cells.
