<p>High levels of growth factors indicate a paracrine mechanism. Adipose-derived stem cells release wound-healing factors and can stimulate recruitment, migration, and proliferation of endogenous cells in the wound environment. We have shown that ADSCs engrafted via an SF/CS carrier demonstrate spontaneous differentiation into a vascular endothelial phenotype, as evidenced by the colocalization of red fluorescence-labeled ADSC and CD31 staining. Further support for this observation is provided by the observation of red fluorescence DIL/Î±-SMA double-positive cells, indicating contribution of a vascular smooth muscle phenotype to the reconstitution of local small vessel matrices This finding is consistent with previous reports.

 </sup> In the present study, we show that ADSCs engraft and differentiate. Immunohistochemistry suggests that the transplanted cells differentiate into vessels, and epithelial phenotypes in their new microenvironment. Consequently, ADSCs can stimulate angiogenesis, epithelialization, and wound remodeling through paracrine secretion and direct differentiation during wound repair.
