<p>This study successfully used a 50:50 SF/CS blend film, seeded and delivery of ADSCs of the same genus, in a diabetic rat dorsal cutaneous wound model. After a series of experiments and obtaining the data of the relevant test, our finding demonstrates that the construct created by the seeding of ADSCs on SF/CS can be used as an effective delivery vehicle in vivo. Neovascularization and epithelialization were the main reasons behind this process.</p>
