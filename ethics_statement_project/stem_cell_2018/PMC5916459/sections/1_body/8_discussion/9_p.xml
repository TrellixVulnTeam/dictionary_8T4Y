<p>On the other hand, in line with previous reports, ADSCs promote tissue regeneration through the establishment and support of local microvascular networks.

 </sup> According to the development of granulation tissue in hematoxylin and eosin in this study, 7 days after transplantation, the neovascularization of the granulation tissue of wound area in ADSC-SF/CS grafted group was significantly faster than that in the other 2 groups. The blood vessels of the granulation tissue were perpendicular to the wound showing a more mature state. Although there was formation of new blood vessels in the SF/CS grafted wound, this was less in number and the morphology was relatively immature. Twenty-one days post-wound healing, the ADSC-SF/CSâ€“transplanted wound basically developed to a near normal, and granulation tissue has translated into new skin tissue, and the transplantation of SF/CS group still only has a formation of a few new blood vessels, the control group wound neovascularization, inflammatory cells, and collagen was not reduced. Our findings demonstrate that ADSC plays an important role in promoting angiogenesis and granulation tissue maturation.
