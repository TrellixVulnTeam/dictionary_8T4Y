<p>Adipose-derived stem cells have excellent regenerative capacity, and multiple studies have proven that they augment tissue repairs. Adipose-derived stem cell is rich in soluble factors with paracrine action on fibroblasts and keratinocytes, such as EGF, fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, TGF-β, VEGF, and platelet-derived growth factor, important cytokines for repair of skin ulcers. Furthermore, with ADSCs involved in neovascular bed establishment at the site of wound repair, there is likely also an autocrine loop functioning, with local ADSCs producing angiogenic factors that act on themselves or neighboring ADSCs in the reestablishment of vascularization.
