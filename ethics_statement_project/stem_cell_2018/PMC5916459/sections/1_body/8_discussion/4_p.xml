<p>In this study, the same kind of ADSCs was used as seed cells for its potential to secrete of growth factors. ADSCs are easy to obtain and provide a much higher yield.

 </sup> In vitro, ADSCs have been verified that they were able to adhere, proliferate, and migrate to SF scaffolds without affecting their properties. In this study, we seed the CM-Dilâ€“labeled cells onto a SF/CS membrane, cultured for 48 hours, and observed by fluorescence microscope. The surface of SF/CS is uneven, so it is difficult to display all the cells in a plane view but through several plane views. The morphology and the distribution of cells become less uniform because of the uneven surface of SF/CS.
