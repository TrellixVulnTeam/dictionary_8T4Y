<p>Tissue engineering includes 3 elements: scaffold, growth factors, and seed cells. Functional biomaterials research is focused on the development and improvement of scaffolding, which can be used to repair or regenerate an organ or tissue. Scaffolds are one of the crucial factors for tissue engineering. Several factors should be considered for developing a device as a skin substitute in tissue engineering, including biocompatibility and safety, degradability, and mechanical properties. Silk fibroin and CS are both natural polymer materials with good biological properties. The advantages of the 2 materials and their positive effects on the wound have been mentioned in this article. After the 2 are blended, they mutually modify each other.

 </sup> concluded that SF/CS is a naturally derived biocompatible scaffold and can be used as a substrate for stem cell delivery. Moreover, their study showed the potential use of SF/CS as a local carrier for autologous stem cells for reconstructive surgery application.
