<p>The effects of ADSCs on fibroblasts play a key role in skin biology, such as wound healing, scar, and photoaging. In the early phase of wound healing, fibroblasts migrate into the wound area and move across fibrin-based provisional matrix. Because the provisional fibrin-based matrix is relatively devoid of fibroblasts, the processes of migration, proliferation, and ECM production are the key steps in the regeneration of a functional dermis. Fibroblasts produce collagen-based ECM that ultimately replaces the provisional fibrin-based matrix and help reapproximate wound edges through their contractile properties.
