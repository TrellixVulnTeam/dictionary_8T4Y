<p>Tissue engineering is an important therapeutic strategy used in regenerative medicine in the present and in the future. Tissue engineering includes 3 elements: scaffold, growth factors, seed cells. Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) have excellent regenerative capacity, and multiple studies have proven that they augment tissue repairs.

 </sup> Functional biomaterials research is focused on the development and improvement of scaffolding, which can be used to repair or regenerate an organ or tissue. Scaffolds are one of the crucial factors for tissue engineering.
