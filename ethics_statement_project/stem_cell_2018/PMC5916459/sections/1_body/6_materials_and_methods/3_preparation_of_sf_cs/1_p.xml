 </sup> Briefly, CS was dissolved in 2% acetic acid and clarified by centrifugation. The final concentration of CS used was 2%. Silk cocoons were cut into pieces, degummed (to remove sericin) with a boiling in 0.01 M Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> solution for 30 minutes, repeated 3 times, and the fibers were washed with deionized water and then kept at 37°C overnight for drying. The degummed SF was dissolved in calcium nitrate tetrahydrate-methanol solution (molar ratio 1:4:2 calcium/water/methyl alcohol at 80°C), dialyzed against distilled water, and lyophilized to obtain a solid SF fluff. The SF fluff was further dissolved in distilled water at a 2% (w/v) concentration over a 3-hour period with continuous stirring to obtained aqueous SF solution. The solution was cooled and stored at 4°C until use. A volume of the same concentration of SF was added to prepare a 50:50 (v/v) SF/CS blend and was allowed to mix for 30 minutes (Fig.
