<p>These diabetic rats (n = 36) were divided into 3 groups with 8 rats in each group randomly: group A, diabetic control with no graft; group B, diabetic treated with SF/CS film alone; and group C, diabetic treated with ADSC-SF/CS. Rats were allowed to manifest hyperglycemia for 8 weeks before surgical wounding. All rats (n = 36) were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (ServiceBio, Inc., Wuhan, China). Their back hair was shaved, carefully. Application field was outlined with marking pen just before removing skin. A 1.5-cm diameter circular impression was made on the middle of dorsum of the mouse. All wounds were cleaned with iodophor and sterile normal saline. Each group received the appropriate graft as described previously, then were covered with Vaseline oil gauze. Finally, 3M transparent dressing was used to tightly fix the graft and was covered with Vaseline oil gauze.</p>
