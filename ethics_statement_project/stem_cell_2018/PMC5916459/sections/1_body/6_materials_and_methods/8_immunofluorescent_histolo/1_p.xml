<p>Paraffin-embedded sections first underwent standard deparaffinization and rehydration procedures, and they were then probed with fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-CD31 antibody (green), anti–α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) antibody (green), anti–cytokeratin 10 antibody (green) (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) for overnight at 4°C. Next, sections were incubated with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The nuclei were then counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride.</p>
