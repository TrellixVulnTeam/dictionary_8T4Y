<p>Adipose-derived stem cells (passage 3) were labeled with CM-Dil, a lipophilic dye that stains the membrane of viable cells. For cell labeling, digested ADSCs were washed with PBS and incubated with CM-Dil (Life Technologies) in a 37°C incubator for 5 minutes, and then for an additional 15 minutes at 4°C. The cells were washed with PBS twice. The cells were then seeded onto a SF/CS membrane at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> ADSCs per cm
 <sup>2</sup>. The cell-seeded SF/CS membrane incubated for 48 hours under standard culture conditions were used for transplantation in animal experiments. Once on the operative field, grafts were transferred to a sterile six-well plate and washed gently in two 500-μL aliquots of PBS to remove any nonadherent cells or medium. The cell-seeded SF/CS membrane cultured for 48 hours was observed in a fluorescence microscope (Fig.
