<p>Stem cell profile was evaluated through membrane receptor phenotyping and differentiation assays. Stem cell markers were determined through cytometric analysis for CD29, CD45, and CD90 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Stem cell pluripotency was evaluated by culture osteogenesis and adipogenesis under specific differentiation medium stimuli. Osteogenesis was induced with low-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, dexamethasone (0.1 μM), ascorbic acid (0.2 mM), and β glycerol phosphate (10 mM) (Sigma) for 24 days. Adipogenesis was induced with high-glucose DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, dexamethasone (1 μM), isobutylmethylxanthine (0.5 mM), insulin (10 μg/mL), and indomethacin (100 μM) (Sigma) for 18 days. Adipocyte lipid and osteocyte calcium deposits were stained with Oil-red-O and Alizarin Red (Chemicon), respectively.</p>
