<p>In this study, we have successfully applied ADSC-seeded SF/CS as a cytoprosthetic hybrid for reconstructive support in a diabetic cutaneous wound healing model which supplies growth factors and promotes angiogenesis of diabetic wound. As a carrier, SF/CS film supports the delivery engraftment and secretion of stem cells, as well as differentiation into vascular and epithelial components. However, there are still some problems and details that have not been resolved, such as the optimum number of cells on the material. In conclusion, ADSC-seeded SF/CS is a promising cell-matrix hybrid and warrants further in vivo study of its potential for reconstructive surgical applications.</p>
