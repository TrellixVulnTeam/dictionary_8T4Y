<p id="Par92">Identifying treatments that reduce symptoms and slow disease progression in knee OA is an important OA research objective. Outcomes from this study will provide the first high-quality RCT evidence of the symptomatic and structural benefits of PRP to either support or discourage use of PRP for knee OA. This is important given that several systematic reviews [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] have highlighted the limited number of RCTs that included a placebo control, all previous trials have a moderate to high risk of bias, and none have included structural outcomes. Likewise, current clinical guidelines vary in their recommendation for PRP, with some not including recommendations either for or against PRP given the lack of evidence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and others recommending against their use [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Findings from the RESTORE trial will, therefore, provide essential information to fill a major evidence gap in the literature and will inform international clinical practice guidelines.
