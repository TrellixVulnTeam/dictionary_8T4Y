<p id="Par24">The primary aim of this two-arm randomised, placebo-controlled trial is to determine if a series of injections of PRP into the knee joint leads to significantly greater reductions in average knee pain severity and less loss of medial tibial cartilage volume when compared to placebo saline injections over 12Â months in people with symptomatic knee OA. The secondary aim is to determine if PRP has significantly greater benefits for other clinical (other knee pain measures, physical function, quality of life, participant global rating of change) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) structural outcomes (effusion, synovitis, cartilage morphology, bone marrow lesions, cartilage defects, meniscal morphology) compared to placebo injections at 2 (clinical) and 12 (clinical and MRI) months. We will also conduct an embedded economic evaluation of PRP if benefits are found.</p>
