<p id="Par21">One therapy with the potential to address underlying biological processes responsible for OA pathogenesis is platelet-rich plasma (PRP), an autologous blood product that contains an elevated concentration of platelets. Activation of PRP releases an initial burst then a sustained release of growth factors and other molecules, including platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-Î², type I insulin-like growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor [

Animal studies have shown that these proteins are responsible for a range of critical tissue healing roles such as chondrocyte apoptosis inhibition, bone and vessel remodelling, inflammatory modulation, and importantly, collagen synthesis. Additionally, other bioactive molecules released by platelets, such as fibrin, act as a scaffold and chemo-attractant for further migration of stem and other cells to the damaged tissue [
