<p id="Par20">Recommended drug therapies (such as analgesics and anti-inflammatory agents) and non-drug therapies (such as exercise) have short-term clinical benefits, but effect sizes are small to moderate at best [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, drug therapies can have adverse events, while uptake and maintenance of exercise are often poor leading to lack of long-term benefit. Intra-articular therapies in clinical use for knee OA include glucocorticoids and hyaluronic acid (a viscosupplement). Intra-articular glucocorticoids are generally recommended [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], although not universally [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and for short-term pain relief only given that benefits are limited to a few weeks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent clinical trial highlighted a potential small deleterious effect of repeated corticosteroid injections on knee joint cartilage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Hyaluronic acid is controversial with most clinical guidelines advising against its use [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], or providing an uncertain recommendation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As knee OA is a chronic disease, with both symptoms and structural deterioration drivers for surgical joint replacement, identifying efficacious, safe treatments that address both is an important objective.
