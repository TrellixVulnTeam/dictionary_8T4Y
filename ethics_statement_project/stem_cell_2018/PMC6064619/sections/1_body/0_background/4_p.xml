<p id="Par22">There is some randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence about the symptomatic effects of PRP for knee OA. A recent systematic review that included 14 RCTs concluded that PRP was likely to be more effective for pain relief and physical function when compared with control injections that included normal saline, HA or glucocorticoids [

However, all RCTs were found to be at a moderate to high risk of bias, and most lacked longer-term follow-up and were inadequately powered with small sample sizes. Only three trials compared PRP to placebo, with results showing significantly greater improvements in symptoms over normal saline at six [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, all three studies suffered from major methodological flaws including a lack of adequate blinding suggesting the benefits may have been overestimated. No study has investigated the structural effects of PRP.
