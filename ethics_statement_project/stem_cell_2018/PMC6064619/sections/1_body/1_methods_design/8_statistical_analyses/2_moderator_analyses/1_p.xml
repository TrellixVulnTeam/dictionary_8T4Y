<p id="Par89">We will also conduct planned exploratory analyses to investigate potential moderators that could influence response to treatment at 12 months. Pre-identified potential moderators include KL grade, body mass index, knee effusion on MRI and knee alignment. A description of the hypothesis for each moderator analysis and the rationale is found in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>. To assess the moderation of the effect of randomised treatment group by binary potential moderators (KL grade and effusion), an interaction term between randomised group and the potential moderator, as well as terms for the randomised group and the potential moderator, will be included in outcome regression models. To assess the moderation of the effect of randomised treatment group by continuous potential moderators (body mass index and knee alignment), the multivariable fractional polynomial interaction approach described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] will be applied. This approach allows for nonlinear functional forms of the continuous potential moderator to be included in the regression model for outcomes, with the potential for separate nonlinear functional forms in each treatment group.
