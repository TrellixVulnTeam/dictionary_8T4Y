<p id="Par90">The cost-effectiveness of PRP will be estimated by calculating the incremental average health care cost of those treated and the difference in pain score and health-related quality of life over the 12 months of the trial compared to the placebo group. The comparison will be reported as the incremental cost per unit change in the pain score, the incremental cost per additional quality-adjusted life year, and the net benefit of treatment at 12 months. The quality-adjusted life year will be calculated using the average AQoL-8D value. Net benefits will be calculated using a range of potential money values of a quality-adjusted life year. Costs will include the cost of treatment and associated imaging as well as the downstream medical, pharmaceutical and hospital costs in each arm. Health care utilisation data will be collected by questionnaire. Cost-effectiveness will be calculated using separate generalised linear regression models for costs and outcomes controlling for baseline levels. Predicted costs and outcomes will be used to calculate means for cost-effectiveness ratios and net benefits with bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. If there is no demonstrated benefit from PRP, we will calculate the incremental average health care cost of those treated. In the secondary economic analysis, the impact on employment and productivity at work will be calculated from data collected by questionnaire.</p>
