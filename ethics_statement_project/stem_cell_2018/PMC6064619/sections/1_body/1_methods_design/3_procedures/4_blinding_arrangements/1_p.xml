<p id="Par57">Participants will not be told until the end of the study which group they were allocated to. Blood will be withdrawn from the arm of participants in both groups to ensure participant blinding. Blood from participants in the placebo group will be disposed of by the study nurse in a separate location. A study nurse will prepare the injection in a separate room and place a patient label over the syringe and needle base to occlude the contents. The nurse will then give the syringe to the injecting doctor who will not know or be able to tell whether the syringe has PRP or saline. The same preparation process will be in place for injection appointment 2 and 3. All clinical and MRI assessments will be conducted by an assessor blinded to treatment allocation.</p>
