 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> outline the trial phases and the schedule for enrolment, screening, interventions and assessments. Participants will complete an online survey to determine initial eligibility and will then be screened over the telephone by one of the researchers. Participants deemed suitable from the telephone screening will be invited to undergo standardized bilateral posteroanterior radiographic and blood screening. Participants who pass telephone, radiographic and blood screening will be invited to attend an appointment with the local site coordinator at either the Department of Physiotherapy at the University of Melbourne in Victoria or the Royal North Shore Hospital in New South Wales, Australia. At this visit, the site coordinator will perform a physical assessment of the knee, and participants who do not have a warm, tense knee effusion will then be deemed suitable for the study. Eligible participants will then complete the baseline clinical and health outcome questionnaire, either on paper or electronically on a PC depending on their preference, and will then attend one of the radiology centres for their baseline knee MRI scans. For those participants with bilaterally eligible knees, the most symptomatic knee will be deemed the study knee. Participants will be asked to discontinue non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other analgesics for knee pain, with the exception of paracetamol for rescue pain relief, from 2 weeks before the baseline assessment until the 12-month follow-up assessment.
