<p id="Par60">Platelet-rich plasma will be prepared using a commercially-available product (Regen Lab SA), which yields a platelet concentration factor of 1.6 to 5 times over whole blood values, and with approximately 80% platelet recovery [

After the blood draw into the Regen blood collection tubes, the tube will be gently inverted several times to mix the anti-coagulant with the blood sample. Samples will then be centrifuged at 1500 g for 5 min in a separate room by the study nurse. After centrifugation, the tubes will be gently agitated to ensure all visible platelet aggregates detach from the separating gel and the tube wall, and 5 mL will be gently withdrawn into a syringe. At the Melbourne site only, a portion of the PRP (approximately 4 mL) will be withdrawn and saved for analysis. A video of the PRP preparation procedure can be found in at
