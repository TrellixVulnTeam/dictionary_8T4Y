<p id="Par58">Participants in both the PRP and placebo groups will undergo three intra-articular knee injections performed at weekly intervals, in line with commonly used injection protocols for this condition [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The doctor will give the participant the option of having a local anaesthetic injection superficially (subcutaneously) before treatment. The doctor will then check the study knee for the presence of an effusion using ultrasound. If present and deemed to be amenable to aspiration, then this will be performed using a needle inserted in the suprapatellar bursa, and the volume aspirated will be recorded. The study nurse will give the doctor an occluded syringe with a needle containing 5 ml of either normal saline or PRP, and the contents will be injected into the knee joint under ultrasound guidance using a medial patellofemoral approach. Following the injection, passive knee flexion and extension will be performed five times with the participant observed resting for 10 min thereafter.
