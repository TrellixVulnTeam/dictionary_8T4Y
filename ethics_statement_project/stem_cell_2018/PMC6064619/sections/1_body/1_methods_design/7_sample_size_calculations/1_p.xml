<p id="Par87">Primary outcomes will be the 12-month change in (i) overall average knee pain severity over the last week measured using an 11-point numeric rating scale; and (ii) medial tibial cartilage volume from MRI expressed as a percentage. The minimum clinically important difference to be detected in OA trials is a change in pain of 1.8 units (out of 10) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Using control group data from our 12-month RCT in people with mild to moderate knee OA, we assume a between-participant standard deviation (SD) of change in pain of 2.4 and baseline to 12-month correlation in scores of 0.29 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. We wish to find a 40% reduction in the amount of medial tibial cartilage volume loss with PRP. Based on our data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], slowing the rate of cartilage loss by this amount could delay the need for knee replacement. We anticipate the control group to lose 2.8% (SD 3.5%) of medial tibial cartilage volume in 12-months [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], with a conservative baseline to 12-month correlation in scores of 0.50. These assumptions, together with an analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline scores, indicate that 115 participants per arm will have 80% power to detect a 40% reduction in loss of cartilage volume with a two-sided significance level of 0.05. With this number of participants, we also have &gt; 99% power to detect the minimum clinically important difference in pain. Allowing for 20% loss to follow-up, we will recruit 144 participants per arm - total 288 participants.
