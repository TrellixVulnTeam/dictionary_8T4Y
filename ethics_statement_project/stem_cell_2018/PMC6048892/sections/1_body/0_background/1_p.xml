<p id="Par18">Patients suffering from small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are at high risk for developing brain metastases (BM) during the course of their disease. Between 40% and 50% of patients develop BM until time of death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and the risk of developing BM further increases with prolonged survival [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is offered to limited disease patients if they respond to first line regime [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, up to 10–15% of patients present with BM at initial diagnosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used as a diagnostic tool for initial staging, the proportion increases to 15–20% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Treatment options are usually limited to whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and palliative chemotherapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The actual effect of therapeutic WBRT has mainly been studied in small retrospective and non-randomized studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moreover, patients within recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class III were commonly excluded from any prospective BM trials that involved WBRT [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In a recent Japanese trial, prophylactic cranial irradiation did not result in longer overall survival compared with observation plus regular MRI follow-ups in patients with extensive disease (ED) SCLC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. PCI is therefore no longer recommended for patients with ED SCLC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] when patients undergo regular MRI brain scans during follow-up [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, the number of patients with oligometastasic cerebral disease might rise.
