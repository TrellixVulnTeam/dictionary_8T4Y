<p id="Par67">Chang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] prospectively evaluated neurocognitive outcome in 58 patients with 1–3 BM from solid tumors and were randomly assigned to SRS + WBRT or SRS alone. The primary endpoint was neurocognitive function measured as a significant deterioration (5-point drop compared with baseline) in HVLT-R total recall at 4 months. After 58 patients were recruited, the trial was stopped on the basis that there was a high probability (96%) that patients receiving SRS plus WBRT were significantly more likely to show a decline in learning and memory function at 4 months than patients assigned to receive SRS alone. SCLC patients often die from thoracic progression, rather than of progression of BM. Therefore, especially for a patient group with a favorable prognosis, the preservation of cognitive function and quality of life is essential.
