<p id="Par65">Radiosurgery and surgery are possible treatment options in patients with a limited number of BM and for patients with BM of less than 3 cm in diameter from solid tumors, except SCLC patients. For patients with 2–4 metastases and with a life expectancy of more than 3 months, radiosurgery should be used rather than WBRT [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. A recent Japanese trial investigated the effect of SRS in 1194 patients with multiple brain metastases from solid tumors. The authors concluded that SRS in patients with 5–10 BM is non-inferior to that in patients with 2–4 BM. Considering the minimal invasiveness of stereotactic radiosurgery and the fewer side effects than with WBRT, SRS might be a suitable alternative for patients with up to 10 brain metastases [
