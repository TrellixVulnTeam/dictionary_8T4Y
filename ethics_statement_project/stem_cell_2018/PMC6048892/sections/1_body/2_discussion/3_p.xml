<p id="Par66">For SCLC patients there is only limited prospective data available regarding locally ablative treatments or SRS. However, a number of retrospective studies investigated the effect of SRS as a treatment in a primary setting and as a salvage option after prior WBRT or PCI in SCLC patients [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Patients who received SRS instead of WBRT showed a comparable or even better survival compared to patients with WBRT. This is, of course, biased by the retrospective design and the limited number of BM in the patient group that received SRS. On the other hand, this implies that a subgroup of patients might be suitable for SRS. In a prospective cohort trial, Li et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] evaluated SRS versus SRS + WBRT and WBRT alone in patients with a single BM of SCLC or non-SCLC. The study did not reveal a statistically significant difference concerning median survival (9.3 vs. 10.6 months) or recurrence and progression. The authors concluded that SRS-alone and SRS + WBRT seem superior to WBRT-alone in prolonging overall survival, local control, and improving quality of life in patients with single BM from lung carcinoma.
