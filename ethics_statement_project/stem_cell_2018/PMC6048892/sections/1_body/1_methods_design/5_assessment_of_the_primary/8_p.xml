<p id="Par48">Patients are followed within the trial protocol for 12 months after baseline visit (T0). After T0, patients are scheduled for follow-up visits every 3 months or as needed clinically, including contrast-enhanced MRI as well as thorough clinical-neurological assessment. Formal neurocognitive testing and quality of life instrument testing will be performed at baseline and during follow-up visits every 3 months. The computer-administered Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) will be used to examine specific components of cognition. The participants will be instructed to respond to stimuli presented on a computer screen by pressing a touch screen. Three tests were chosen to evaluate further neurocognitive changes: Paired Associated Learning for paired Associates Learning assesses visual memory and new learning [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], as well as measures of movement time, reaction time, response accuracy and impulsivity. Further, Spatial Working Memory will be used [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], which requires retention and manipulation of visuospatial information. Staff members administering the tests were trained and approved by the clinical neuropsychologist in the project group.
