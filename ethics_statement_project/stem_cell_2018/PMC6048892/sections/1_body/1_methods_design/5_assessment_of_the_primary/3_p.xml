<p id="Par43">Time to death due to BM is defined as number of days from randomization until death due to BM or end of follow-up, where death due to BM is defined as death with intracranial progression as a component of cause of death. Locally progression-free survival time is defined as number of days from randomization until local tumor progression, death without prior local progression, or end of follow-up. The occurring events of interest will be classified as (1) progression of cerebral metastases present at baseline only, (2) occurrence of new cerebral metastases only, (3) simultaneous detection of progression of cerebral metastases present at baseline and of new metastases, and (4) death without local progression.</p>
