<p id="Par40">After meeting eligibility criteria, 56 patients will be randomly assigned to SRS or WBRT. To achieve comparable intervention groups, patients will be allocated in a concealed fashion in a 1:1 ratio by means of randomization using a centralized web-based tool (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomizer.at" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.randomizer.at</ext-link>). Randomization will be stratified with respect to time of appearance (synchronous vs. metachronous). Block randomization with varying block lengths will be performed to achieve equal group sizes in total. BM are defined as synchronous if discovered at the time of initial diagnosis of the primary tumor or within 3Â months thereafter. All other patients will be classified as metachronous.
