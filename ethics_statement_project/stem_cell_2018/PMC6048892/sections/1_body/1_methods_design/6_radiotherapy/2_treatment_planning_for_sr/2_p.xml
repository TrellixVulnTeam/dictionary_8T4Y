<p id="Par52">Organs at risk are contoured and adapted on the basis of CT scans and MRI. For target delineation, a gross target volume (GTV) and a planning target volume (PTV) are contoured. The basis for GTV definition is the contrast-based, T1-weighted, three-dimensional MPRAGE sequence. The GTV consists of all contrast-enhanced tissue associated with the target lesion and all additional tissue judged by an experienced physician to be part of the suspect target lesion (e.g. non-contrast-enhanced necrotic tissue within or adjoining cystic metastatic lesions). To the GTV, a PTV margin of 1Â mm is added by isotropic expansion that can be slightly modified if deemed necessary by the treating physician (e.g., intersection with adjoining organs at risk).</p>
