<p id="Par50">For WBRT, patients will be immobilized using an individually manufactured head mask. For treatment planning, computed tomography (CT) without contrast, contrast-enhanced CT as well as MRI will be performed for optimal target definition. The target volume includes the whole brain. WBRT will be delivered by opposed lateral 6Â MeV photon beams. Dose constraints of normal tissue will be respected according to QUANTEC reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. WBRT will be applied in 10 once-daily fractions each of 3 Gy, to a total dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions to the whole brain.
