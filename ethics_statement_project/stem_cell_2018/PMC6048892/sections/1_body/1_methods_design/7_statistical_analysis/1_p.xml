<p id="Par59">The primary hypothesis of the trial is that there is a difference between the two treatment arms with respect to the primary endpoint, defined as a drop of at least 5 points from baseline in HVLT-R total recall at 3 months after baseline (T0). Chang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] observed deterioration probabilities of 0.64 for SRS + WBRT and 0.20 for SRS alone at 4 months after baseline. Based on those results, assuming a deterioration probability of 0.20 for the SRS arm and 0.64 for the WBRT arm in our trial, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 19 patients per arm are required to demonstrate a difference between treatment arms applying a χ
 <sup>2</sup> test at a two-sided significance level of α = 0.05 with a probability of 1–β = 0.8. Assuming exponentially distributed survival times with a median of 6 months for both groups, 29.3% of all randomized patients are expected to have died before the measurement of the primary endpoint. Thus, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 28 patients per group are required to yield a sufficiently high power for a comparison of the deterioration rate within the two groups. Statistical analysis is based on the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports and Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials. A detailed methodology for the statistical analysis will be described in the statistical analysis plan, which will be finalized before database lock. Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS v9.4 or higher.
