 <p>Although induction immunochemotherapy including high‐dose cytarabine and rituximab followed by high‐dose chemotherapy (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">HDC</styled-content>) with autologous stem cell transplantation (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">ASCT</styled-content>) is recommended for younger patients (≤65 years old) with untreated mantle cell lymphoma (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">MCL</styled-content>), no standard induction and 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">HDC</styled-content> regimen has been established. We conducted a phase 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">II</styled-content> study of induction immunochemotherapy of R‐High‐
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">CHOP</styled-content>/
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">CHASER</styled-content> followed by 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">HDC</styled-content> of 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">LEED</styled-content> with 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">ASCT</styled-content> in younger patients with untreated advanced 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">MCL</styled-content>. Eligibility criteria included untreated 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">MCL</styled-content>, stage 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">II</styled-content> bulky to 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">IV</styled-content>, and age 20‐65 years. Patients received 1 cycle of R‐High‐
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">CHOP</styled-content> followed by 3 cycles of 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">CHASER</styled-content> every 3 weeks. Peripheral blood stem cells (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">PBSC</styled-content>) were harvested during 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">CHASER</styled-content>. 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">LEED</styled-content> with 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">ASCT</styled-content> was delivered to patients who responded to R‐High‐
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">CHOP</styled-content>/
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">CHASER</styled-content>. Primary endpoint was 2‐year progression‐free survival (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">PFS</styled-content>). From June 2008 to June 2012, 45 patients (median age 59 years; range 38‐65 years) were enrolled. 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">PBSC</styled-content> were successfully harvested from 36 of 43 patients. Thirty‐five patients completed 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">ASCT</styled-content>. Two‐year 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">PFS</styled-content> was 77% (80% 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">CI</styled-content> 68‐84), which met the primary endpoint. Five‐year 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">PFS</styled-content> and overall survival were 52% (95% 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">CI</styled-content> 34‐68%) and 71% (95% 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">CI</styled-content> 51‐84%), respectively. Overall response and complete response rates after induction immunochemotherapy were 96% and 82%, respectively. The most common grade 4 toxicities were hematological. In younger patients with untreated 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">MCL</styled-content>, R‐High‐
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">CHOP</styled-content>/
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">CHASER</styled-content>/
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">LEED</styled-content> with 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case">ASCT</styled-content> showed high efficacy and acceptable toxicity, and it can now be considered a standard treatment option.
