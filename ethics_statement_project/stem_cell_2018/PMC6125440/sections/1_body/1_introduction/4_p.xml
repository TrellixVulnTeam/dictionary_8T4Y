<p>A phase II MCL‐2 study by the Nordic Lymphoma Group including HDAC and rituximab prior to stem cell mobilization, followed by HDC and ASCT, demonstrated an excellent ORR (96%), with a CR rate of 56%, and PFS of 70% and OS of 70% after 6 years.
 <xref rid="cas13719-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> Similar promising results were also reported in another phase II study of an induction regimen with R‐CHOP and R‐DHAP followed by ASCT, which was conducted by GELA.
 <xref rid="cas13719-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> This regimen of 6 cycles of alternating R‐CHOP/R‐DHAP followed by consolidative HDC with ASCT resulted in a superior PFS compared with the regimen of 6 cycles of R‐CHOP followed by consolidative HDC with ASCT reported for a randomized phase III study by the European Mantle Cell Network (European MCL Network).
 <xref rid="cas13719-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> Recently, rituximab maintenance after ASCT was shown to improve event‐free survival, PFS, and OS in younger patients with MCL in a randomized phase III study by LYSA.
 <xref rid="cas13719-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> Thus, HDC with ASCT after intensive immunochemotherapy using rituximab and HDAC as first‐line treatment, followed by rituximab maintenance, appears to be the only current therapy that might improve the outcomes of younger patients with untreated advanced MCL.
