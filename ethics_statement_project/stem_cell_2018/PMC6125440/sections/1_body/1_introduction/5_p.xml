<p>We developed the R‐High‐CHOP/cyclophosphamide, high‐dose cytarabine, dexamethasone, etoposide, and rituximab (CHASER) regimen as an induction therapy, and LEED therapy as HDC. One cycle of the R‐High‐CHOP regimen was incorporated to enhance MCL tumor reduction. CHASER and CHASE were originally developed for both salvage therapy without a platinum agent to avoid renal toxicity and for in vivo efficacy of purging of B‐cell lymphoma cells during harvesting of autologous PBSC.
