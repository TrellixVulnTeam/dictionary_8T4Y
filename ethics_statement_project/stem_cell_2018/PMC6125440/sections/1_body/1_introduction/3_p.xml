<p>However, a randomized phase III study by the European MCL Network that compared myeloablative radiochemotherapy followed by ASCT with interferon‐α (IFN‐α) maintenance during the first remission after a CHOP‐like regimen demonstrated significant superiority of ASCT, with PFS of 45% in younger patients aged 65 years or less in patients with advanced‐stage MCL.

These strategies are based on clinical studies in which the addition of rituximab to an HDAC‐containing regimen was reported to ensure tumor depletion in vivo while allowing the collection of PBSC with conserved engraftment capability that was devoid of tumor cells.
