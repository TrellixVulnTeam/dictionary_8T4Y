<p>In the present study, opportunistic infections including cytomegalovirus infection, adenovirus cystitis and 
 <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> pneumonia were observed in 5 patients. Although the patients recovered from these infections, routine monitoring of the number of peripheral CD4+ lymphocytes was essential because intensive immunochemotherapy caused severe lymphocytopenia. After encouraging all participating institutions to do this examination, no further opportunistic infections were reported. In the present study, 22.2% of patients developed grade 3 or 4 hypokalemia. Grade 4 hypokalemia developed in 1 patient after both induction therapy and LEED high‚Äêdose therapy. The most likely reason for hypokalemia may have been the frequent use of diuretics for increased body weight as a result of the considerable volume of infusion fluid for CHASER and LEED therapy.
