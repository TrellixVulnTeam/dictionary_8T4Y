<p>In the present study, PFS with the R‐High‐CHOP/CHASER/LEED with ASCT regimen was comparable with that reported for other regimens containing rituximab and HDAC followed by consolidative HDC with ASCT.

 <xref rid="cas13719-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> Addition of both HDAC and rituximab (MCL2 study) dramatically improved the PFS (4‐year PFS of 73% and 6‐year PFS of 66%) compared to the PFS (4‐year PFS of 37%) with previous MCL‐1 protocol treatments.

 <xref rid="cas13719-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> The 5‐year event‐free survival in the GELA phase II study of 3 cycles of R‐CHOP and 3 cycles of R‐DHAP followed by ASCT was 64%.
 <xref rid="cas13719-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> In the randomized phase III study by the European MCL Network, the 5‐year PFS in the experimental arm of 6 cycles of the alternating R‐CHOP/R‐DHAP regimen followed by consolidative HDC with ASCT and the control arm of 6 cycles of R‐CHOP followed by consolidative HDC with ASCT was 65% and 44%, respectively.
 <xref rid="cas13719-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> The present results provide further data to support the treatment approach used in these prior studies. Combined with the present data, the present findings strongly suggest that HDAC‐based high‐dose consolidation therapy followed by ASCT has dramatically improved the prognosis of MCL compared with the prognosis reported with conventional immunochemotherapy such as R‐CHOP

 <xref rid="cas13719-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> Therefore, HDAC‐based high‐dose consolidation therapy followed by ASCT should be considered a standard treatment strategy for frontline treatment of younger MCL patients.
