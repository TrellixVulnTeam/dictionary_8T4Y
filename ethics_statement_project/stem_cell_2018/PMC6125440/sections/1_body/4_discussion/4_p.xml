<p>Recently, rituximab maintenance after ASCT was reported to improve event‚Äêfree survival, PFS, and OS in younger patients with MCL.
 <xref rid="cas13719-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> PFS at 4 years was 83% in the rituximab maintenance group versus 64% in the observation group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and OS was 89% vs 80% (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.04), respectively. In this study, no patients received rituximab maintenance, and PFS and OS at 4 years were almost the same as in the observation group. It is likely that adding rituximab maintenance to our regimen will improve outcomes further.
