<p>According to the protocol, auto‐PBSC were harvested during the second CHASER and, if necessary, during the third CHASER, to avoid contamination of harvested auto‐PBSC with MCL cells. As highly efficient harvest of auto‐PBSC was observed during the first CHASER (data not shown), it is possible that a greater number of patients may proceed to ASCT if the harvest of auto‐PBSC is initiated during the first CHASER. Possibility that the harvest of auto‐PBSC in the early period of intensive induction chemotherapy may result in a highly efficient harvest was suggested in a recent phase II study.

The R‐HyperCVAD/MA arm was prematurely closed as a result of failure of stem cell collection and/or delay of therapy because of hematological toxicity.
