<p>Recently, Hoster et al reported that a modified MIP1 that combines the Ki‐67 index with MIPI (MIPI‐c) provided a refined risk stratification, reflecting their strong complementary prognostic effects while integrating the most relevant prognostic factors available in routine clinical practice.
 <xref rid="cas13719-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> In the present study, a very good OS at 5 years of 95.2% (95%CI 70.7‐99.3%) in low‐risk group (
 <italic>N</italic>=21), and a very poor OS of 0% in high‐risk group (
 <italic>N</italic>=2) were also observed when risk group was stratified according to MIPI‐c.
