<p>Our R‐High‐CHOP/CHASER/LEED therapy was well tolerated. The nonrelapse mortality of 4.4% (2/45), which included 1 case with ATL who was a HTLV type‐1 carrier and developed acute type ATL after the completion of the protocol treatment, and 1 case with DLBCL as PTLD, is comparable with that reported in the Nordic MCL‐2 study (5%).

Although a patient who developed latent prostatic carcinoma completed protocol treatment including ASCT, a patient who developed AML did not receive LEED therapy followed by ASCT. The cause of these 2 secondary malignancies is difficult to determine, especially with respect to the relationship with protocol treatment, because they developed following postprotocol treatment. No grade 2 or greater increased creatinine levels occurred during any of the treatment cycles, because R‐High‐CHOP/CHASER/LEED therapy does not contain any platinum agents. In contrast, 8.3% (N = 5; 3 patients with grade 3 or 4) of 60 enrolled patients developed renal insufficiency in the GELA study during which they were treated with DHAP using cisplatin.
