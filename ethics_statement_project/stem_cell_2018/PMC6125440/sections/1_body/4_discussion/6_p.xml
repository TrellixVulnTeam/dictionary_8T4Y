<p>In the present study, 22.2% of all enrolled patients did not receive ASCT, whereas in the Nordic MCL‐2 study 6.8% of all 160 eligible patients did not proceed to the high‐dose regimen because of toxicity or patient refusal.
 <xref rid="cas13719-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> Five of the present 10 patients did not proceed to ASCT due only to insufficient harvest. In 7 of all 43 harvested patients, collected PBSC did not reach the threshold number of stem cells per protocol (≥2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CD34‐positive cells per kg body weight). Thus, the percentage of PBSC collected was 84%.
