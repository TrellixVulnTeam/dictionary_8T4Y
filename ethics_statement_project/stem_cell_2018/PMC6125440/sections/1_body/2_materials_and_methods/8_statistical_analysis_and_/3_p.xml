<p>Secondary endpoints were ORR, CR rate, proportion of CR and ORR after induction therapy, PFS, 5‐year PFS, OS, 2‐year OS, 5‐year OS, and toxicity. OS was calculated from the date of registration until death as a result of any cause or censored at the last follow‐up date. PFS was calculated from the date of registration to the date of relapse or progression, death as a result of any cause, or censored at the date of the last follow up. CR rate and ORR (CR + PR) and 95% CI were estimated by an exact binomial method. OS and PFS were estimated according to the Kaplan‐Meier method, and CI were estimated by Greenwood's formula. These analyses were carried out using SAS release 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).</p>
