<p>The R‐High‐CHOP/CHASER regimen comprised 1 cycle of R‐High CHOP consisting of 1500 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> CPA and 75 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> doxorubicin followed by 3 cycles of CHASER consisting of 1200 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> CPA on day 3, 2 g/m
 <sup>2</sup> cytarabine on days 4 and 5, 100 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> etoposide on days 3‐5, 40 mg/body weight dexamethasone on days 1, 3‐5 and 15, and 375 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> rituximab on days 1 and 15 (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas13719-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). HDC in LEED therapy consisting of 130 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> melphalan, 60 mg/kg CPA, 500 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup> etoposide, and 40 mg/body dexamethasone was started on day 36‐49 of the last CHASER therapy. PBSC were harvested after the 2nd cycle of CHASER, and further harvesting was added after the 3rd CHASER cycle if the number of PBSC was less than 4 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/kg. Although the recommended number of harvested CD34‐positive cells was ≥4 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/kg, patients obtaining ≥2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/kg could proceed to HDT with ASCT. Patients received sulfamethoxazole‐trimethoprim from induction therapy until 6 months after ASCT to prevent opportunistic infections caused by
