<p>All 45 treated patients were evaluated for toxicity (Table 
 <xref rid="cas13719-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The most common grade 4 toxicities were hematological; the percentage of patients with grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was 80% and 0% in R‐High‐CHOP, 91% and 89% in CHASER, and 94% and 77% in LEED, respectively. There were no grade 4 nonhematological or nonlaboratory toxicities during the entire protocol treatment. In R‐High‐CHOP therapy, 1 grade 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was observed, and grade 3 increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and hyponatremia were observed in 1 patient each. All of these adverse events were reversible.
