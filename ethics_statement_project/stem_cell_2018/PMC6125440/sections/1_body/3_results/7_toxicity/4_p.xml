<p>In LEED therapy, grade 4 hypokalemia was observed in 1 patient, and grade 3 increased AST, increased ALT, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia were observed in 2, 3, 1, and 5 patients, respectively. All of these adverse events were reversible. In the present study, 3 types of opportunistic infection were observed in 5 patients, including grade 3 
 <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> pneumonia in 2 patients, grade 3 cytomegalovirus infection in 2 patients, and grade 3 adenovirus cystitis in 2 patients; one patients had cytomegalovirus infection followed by adenovirus cystitis, sequentially. Treatment‐related death occurred in 1 patient as a result of brain DLBCL after the development of Epstein Barr (EB) virus‐positive post‐transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) on day 159 after ASCT. Secondary malignancies including AML, prostate cancer, DLBCL, and ATL developed in 1 patient each. Incidence of secondary malignancies was 8.9% (95% CI 2.5‐21.2%).
