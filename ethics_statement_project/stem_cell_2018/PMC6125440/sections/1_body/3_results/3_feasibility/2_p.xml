<p>Flowchart of the clinical course of enrolled patients is shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="cas13719-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. All 45 enrolled patients received R‐High‐CHOP, among whom 40 patients completed R‐High‐CHOP followed by 3 cycles of CHASER, and 5 patients did not (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas13719-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Although all 40 patients who completed the R‐High‐CHOP/CHASER induction therapy achieved CR or PR, 5 of these 40 patients did not receive high‐dose LEED therapy with ASCT because of insufficient harvest of auto‐PBSC in 4 patients and an adverse event in 1 patient. Therefore, 35 patients received high‐dose LEED therapy with ASCT. PBSC were harvested in 43 of 45 patients because induction therapy was discontinued at less than 2 cycles as a result of disease progression or patient's refusal in 1 case each. In 43 patients, median number of harvested PBSC was 3.80 (range 0.40‐38.40) × 10
 <sup>6</sup>/kg cells. In 36 patients, ≥2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>/kg cells PBSC were harvested, whereas in 7 patients, less than 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>/kg cells PBSC were harvested. Percentage of successfully collected PBSC was 84%. In 2 of 7 patients with insufficient harvest of auto‐PBSC, additional harvests were carried out outside the protocol, and they received high‐dose LEED therapy with ASCT. These 2 patients were finally judged as having protocol treatment.
