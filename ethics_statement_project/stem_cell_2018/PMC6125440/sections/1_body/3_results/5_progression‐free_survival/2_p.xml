<p>Median follow‐up time for all enrolled patients was 3.7 years in the primary analysis. Two‐year PFS as the primary endpoint of all enrolled patients was estimated to be 77.3% (lower boundary of 80% CI 68.0%, which exceeded the threshold of 30%, and 95% CI 61.9‐87.1%), which met the primary endpoint (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas13719-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). PFS at 5 years was estimated to be 52.2% (95% CI 33.8‐67.8). PFS at 5 years for patients with low‐risk (N = 28), intermediate‐risk (N = 14), and high‐risk (N = 2) disease according to MIPI was 59.9% (95% CI 37.4‐76.6%), 51.6% (95% CI 21.6‐75.1%), and 0%, respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas13719-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). PFS at 5 years for patients with low‐risk (N = 21), low‐intermediate risk (N = 13), high‐intermediate risk (N = 8), and high‐risk (N = 2) disease according to MIPI‐c was 66.2% (95% CI 38.4‐83.8%), 44.0% (95% CI 16.8‐68.4%), 58.3% (95% CI 18.0‐84.4%), and 0%, respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="cas13719-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). PFS rates at 5 years for patients who received LEED therapy followed by ASCT (n = 35) and for patients who did not receive LEED therapy followed by ASCT for any reason including harvesting failure of PBSC (n = 10) were 54.8% (95% CI 33.0‐72.1%) and 42.2% (95% CI 11.1‐71.3%), respectively.
