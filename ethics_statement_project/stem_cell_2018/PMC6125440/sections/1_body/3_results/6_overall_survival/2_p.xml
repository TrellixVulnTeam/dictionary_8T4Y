<p>Overall survival of all 45 enrolled patients is shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="cas13719-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A. Eleven patients died (7 died of MCL, 3 died of secondary malignancy [1 acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 1 adult T‐cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), and 1 diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (DLBCL)]), and 1 died after postprotocol treatment). OS at 2 years and 5 years was estimated to be 91% (95% CI 77.7‐96.5%) and 71.0% (95% CI 50.9‐84.1%), respectively. Subgroup analysis of OS according to MIPI and MIPI‐c is shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="cas13719-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B,C, respectively. OS rates at 5 years for patients who received LEED therapy followed by ASCT (n = 35) and for patients who did not receive LEED therapy followed by ASCT for any reason including harvesting failure of PBSC (n = 10) were 71.9% (95% CI 47.4‐86.4%) and 67.5% (95% CI 29.1‐88.3%), respectively.
