<p id="Par15">Without history of trauma, skin manifestations have been suggested to be probable cutaneous markers for early detection of overt diabetes or prediabetes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As has been reported, bullosis diabecticorum could precede the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], consistent with our reported case. Bullosis diabecticorum is also commonly known as diabetic bullous disease, which is a rare, spontaneous, and non-inflammatory diabetic complication with an incidence rate of 0.16% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The pathogenesis is largely ambiguous, with some researchers believing that a long duration of microvascular disease results in skin dystrophy with capillary basement membrane thickening, which eventually leads to blister formation with tissue hypoxia and microcirculation ischemia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The predisposition to develop bullosis diabeticorum, as we learnt from this case, seems to be associated with varying degrees of limb ischemia. Notably, both Doppler ultrasonography and magnetic resonance angiography showed that this patient had suffered multiple vascular stenoses in the lower extremity. Previous studies have revealed that peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the lower limb was one of significant and independent risk factors for diabetic foot infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, lower extremity cellulitis followed by bullosis diabecticorum was considered as a complication of diabetic PAD in this case.
