<p id="Par18">This case describes a patient with a repeated blister disease and cellulitis that were resistant to various treatment modalities but eventually improved with the application of autologous BMMSCs. Autologous bone marrow cell therapy is a feasible, safe, and potentially effective therapeutic strategy for PAD patients who are considered unsuitable candidates for traditional revascularization. This case highlights the potential effect of autologous BMMSCs to relieve repeated cellulitis and blister disease. Early identification of diabetes and its complications and appropriate treatment may improve clinical outcomes and prevent lower limb amputation.</p>
