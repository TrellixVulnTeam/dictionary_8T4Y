<p id="Par11">A 64-year-old male presented to hospital in July 2004 for the sudden occurrence of cutaneous blisters of varying sizes with associated signs and symptoms of cellulitis in the left lateral lower limb, including erythema, edema, increased skin temperature, and tenderness. In May 2005, the patient was re-admitted to the hospital with similar signs and symptoms in the left lower limb when he was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus based on fasting serum glucose level and 2-h postprandial serum glucose (10.06 mmol/L and 14.6 mmol/L, respectively), even though he was not aware of having diabetes mellitus prior to this admission. In addition, this patient had a medical history of hypertension and was previously a smoker. In the following 2 years, the patient had four other hospital admissions due to recurring episodes of cutaneous blistering at the same anatomical location. During the physical examination, multiple clear fluid-filled vesicles of variable dimensions were observed in the left lower limb, surrounded by subcutaneous cellulitis (Fig.
