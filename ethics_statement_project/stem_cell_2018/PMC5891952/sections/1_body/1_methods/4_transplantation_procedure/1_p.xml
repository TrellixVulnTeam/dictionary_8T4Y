Nine months after treatment, the patient developed another episode of bullosis diabeticorum with accompanying cellulitis in the same lower limb and they were successfully treated similarly tot he previous measures. At a 10-year follow-up period, the patient reported no recurrence of bullosis diabeticorum in the left lower limb (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). Peripheral vascular assessment was performed again in October 2017 and the left and right ABI was 1.03 and 0.89, respectively.
