<p id="Par13">With reference to our previous research technique [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], 30 ml bone barrow was extracted from the patient under aseptic and anesthetic conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Mononuclear stem cells were isolated using density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The harvested autologous BMMSCs, with a total cell count of 7.8 × 10
 <sup>7</sup>, were cultured with alpha-modified minimum essential medium (α-MEM; Invitrogen-Life Technologies Corp., USA) supplemented with 10% autologous serum. The culture medium was replaced every 3 days. Once approximately 70% confluence was achieved, the cultured stem cells were resuspended in trypsin-EDTA. Cells with an approximately adjusted cell density of 4000 cells per cm
 <sup>2</sup> were transferred once every 5 days. The above procedures were done in accordance with the criteria for cell transplantation: (1) negative results of the microbiological tests; (2) endotoxin content of ≤ 5 EU/kg patient body weight; and (3) cell viability of ≥ 95% [
