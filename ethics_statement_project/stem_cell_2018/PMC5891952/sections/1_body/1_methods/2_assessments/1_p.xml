<p id="Par12">Peripheral vascular assessment was performed to establish the vascular status in the bilateral lower extremities. Pedal pulses, both the posterior tibialis and the dorsalis pedis artery, were found to be palpable and regular. The left and right ankle brachial index (ABI) was 0.72 and 0.85, respectively. Lower extremity ultrasound revealed atheromatous plaque formation in the tunica intima of the left femoral and popliteal artery, and atherosclerotic plaque formation in the anterior wall of the left femoral artery. Doppler ultrasound demonstrated no vascular abnormalities in major vessels of the left lower limb. Evaluation of the bilateral peripheral arterial system was also achieved with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). There were no abnormalities in the bilateral internal iliac, external iliac, and femoral artery, except for vessel wall thickening of the left femoral and perforating arteries and enlargement of the left posterior tibial artery. Venography of the left lower limb showed delay in the venous return compared to the contralateral limb. Plain X-ray showed no soft tissue swelling and no bony cortical erosion or periosteal reaction and no subcutaneous gas or osteomyelitis was detected. Combined with the clinical assessments and literature review, recurrent bullosis diabeticorum and cellulitis could be associated with lower limb ischemia and venous stasis. Diabetic neuropathy was excluded through nerve conduct velocity, a gold standard for diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy.</p>
