<p id="Par21">There was no notable relationship in this patient population between plerixafor exposure and increase in peripheral blood CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>). Logistic regression analysis confirmed that there was no statistically significant relationship between treatment response and systemic exposure after adjusting for country and baseline peripheral blood CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell count. In multiple logistic regression analysis, the only baseline factor with a significant relationship to response was the baseline peripheral blood CD34
 <sup>+</sup> count on Day 4 prior to first administration of plerixafor. A subgroup analysis also indicated that a pre-apheresis count of ≥10 cells/µL was associated with a greater proportion of patients reaching ≥5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells/kg in ≤4 days of apheresis compared with &lt;10 cells/µL (100% vs. 40% in the FD arm; 100% vs. 33% in the WB arm) (Supplementary Table S
