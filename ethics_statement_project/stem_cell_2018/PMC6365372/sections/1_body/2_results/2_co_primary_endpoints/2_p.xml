<p id="Par18">PK parameters are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The co-primary PK endpoint of relative systemic exposure by AUC
 <sub>0–10</sub> indicated higher total systemic exposure in the FD group (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The least squares ratio of geometric means for FD versus WB AUC
 <sub>0–10</sub> was 1.43 (90% CI 1.32, 1.54), which is outside of predefined equivalence bounds.
