<p id="Par22">The observed safety profile in this study was consistent with the known safety profile of plerixafor, and no unexpected AEs were reported. A similar number of patients in the FD and WB arms experienced AEs (87% and 84%, respectively), which were typically grade 1–2. The frequency of drug-related AEs was also similar (40% and 32%, respectively). The most common AEs (≥20% in either group) were platelet count decreased (FD 47%, WB 26%), hypokalemia (FD 17%, WB 23%), diarrhea (FD 27%, WB 13%), nausea (FD 13%, WB 23%), and anemia (FD 17%, WB 23%). The proportion of patients experiencing grade 3–4 AEs was similar in the FD and WB arms (33% and 36%, respectively); those occurring in &gt;1 patient in either group were platelet count decreased (FD 27%, WB 19%), thrombocytopenia (FD 0%, WB 6%), and hypocalcemia (FD 7%, WB 3%). Three patients in the WB arm developed treatment-emergent SAEs (2 progressive disease and 1 cellulitis), which were considered unrelated to study drug. There were no AEs leading to discontinuation of plerixafor and no deaths during the study.</p>
