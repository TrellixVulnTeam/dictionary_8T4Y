<p id="Par26">The results of this prospective randomized trial align with the available data and do not identify statistically significant or clinically meaningful differences in HSC mobilization efficacy between an FD and a WB dosing regimen of plerixafor plus G-CSF in patients with low body weight, despite higher total systemic PK exposure with an FD schedule in this patient population. Furthermore, the higher PK exposure in the FD group did not translate into a clinically meaningful increase in reported AEs. The inference is that the issue seen by the assessors in the pivotal NHL study was more likely to have been related to other confounding factors or chance, and that the use of the approved plerixafor WB dose of 0.24 mg/kg does not compromise efficacy or safety in patients with a body weight of ≤70 kg.</p>
