<p id="Par25">Factors such as apheresis blood volumes, activity of G-CSF, prior chemotherapy, or pre-apheresis peripheral blood CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell counts may have contributed to lower apheresis yields observed in the pivotal study in the low-weight NHL patients. Other studies investigating factors affecting apheresis yields have not found evidence that body weight is a contributing factor [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A retrospective analysis of patients with NHL (
 <italic>n</italic> = 238) or multiple myeloma (
 <italic>n</italic> = 602) who underwent mobilization with chemotherapy followed by G-CSF found no effect of body weight, sex, age, or previous irradiation therapy on the incidence of poor mobilization, whereas the total number of previous chemotherapy cycles did have a significant impact [

In a position statement on autologous HSC mobilization by experts from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, factors predicting poor mobilization or mobilization failure include older age, more advanced disease, prior chemotherapy (number of lines, type), and previous irradiation, with low CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cell count in peripheral blood before apheresis being the most robust [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This is supported by our subgroup analysis showing that a pre-apheresis count of ≥10 cells/µL was associated with a greater proportion of patients achieving the target cell collection endpoint compared with &lt;10 cells/µL.
