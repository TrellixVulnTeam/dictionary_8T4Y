<p id="Par23">Plerixafor plus G-CSF is approved for stem cell mobilization prior to auto-HSCT based on two phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies, which demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this combination [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Regulatory review of the data in the pivotal NHL study suggested that there may be slightly lower HSC mobilization in patients with low body weight in that trial, which might potentially be associated with a lower plerixafor exposure. Therefore, this randomized trial was performed to clarify if any significant differences in mobilization success rates could be identified between a 20-mg FD dose and the standard 0.24-mg/kg WB dose of plerixafor in this specific patient population. In this trial, no significant difference was identified between the FD and WB arms in the proportion of patients achieving the co-primary efficacy endpoint of an HSC collection of ≥5 × 10
