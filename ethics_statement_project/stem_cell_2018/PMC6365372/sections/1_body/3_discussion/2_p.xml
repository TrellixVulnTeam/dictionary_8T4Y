<p id="Par24">The proportions of patients achieving the target cell collection (60.0% in the FD group and 54.8% patients in the WB group) were consistent with that seen in the pivotal phase III NHL study (59.3%) [

 <sup>6</sup> CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells/kg was achieved in similar proportions of patients in both treatment arms (FD group, 93.3%; WB group, 90.3%), and was also consistent with the observed proportion (86.7%) in the pivotal study. Additional data are available from a European plerixafor compassionate use program reported by Hübel et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], which enrolled 270 patients with NHL who had previously failed mobilization/collection, or who were determined to be unable to mobilize sufficient HSCs based on peripheral blood CD34+ cell counts during mobilization. The patients, ranging in weight from 43 to 132 kg (median 72 kg) and having received a median of 2 prior chemotherapy regimens, underwent HSC mobilization with plerixafor (0.24 mg/kg) and G-CSF (±chemotherapy as determined by individual investigators). The minimum target number of ≥2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells/kg was achieved in 64.8% of patients (median count 2.56 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells/kg).
