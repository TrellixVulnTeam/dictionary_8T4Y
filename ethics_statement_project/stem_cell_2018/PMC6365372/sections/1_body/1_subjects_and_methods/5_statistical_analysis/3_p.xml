<p id="Par15">Total systemic exposure to plerixafor was determined from the PK estimate of AUC
 <sub>0–10</sub> for each patient using a linear model that included treatment as the independent variable. For the mean test:reference ratio, the predefined equivalence bounds for the 90% confidence interval (CI) were 0.70–1.43. The relationship between treatment response and systemic exposure was explored using logistic regression models. All summaries and statistical analyses were generated using SAS Version 9.0 or higher.
