<p id="Par13">Based on study AMD3100-3101 (NCT00103610) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], a sample size of 70 patients who weighed ≤70 kg (35 patients per treatment arm) would provide 80% power to detect a 30% improvement in the proportion of patients achieving the stem cell collection target of ≥5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/kg in ≤4 days of apheresis in the FD arm, assuming that the proportion of patients in the WB arm achieving this target was 52%, at an alpha level of 0.05.
