<p id="Par6">Following screening, eligible patients received a mobilization regimen consisting of G-CSF (10 μg/kg/day) for 4 days administered by SC injection (Neupogen
 <sup>®</sup> [Amgen Inc.] or GRAN
 <sup>®</sup> [Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd.] only). The baseline peripheral blood CD34+ cell count was determined on the morning of Day 4 and used to assign patients to one of two groups: &lt;10 CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells/μL and ≥10 CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells/μL. Prior to the first dose of plerixafor on the evening of Day 4, patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio within each CD34
 <sup>+</sup> group to receive either plerixafor WB 0.24 mg/kg SC or FD 20 mg SC. Randomization was performed using an automated interactive voice response system incorporating a central randomization and drug supply scheme.
