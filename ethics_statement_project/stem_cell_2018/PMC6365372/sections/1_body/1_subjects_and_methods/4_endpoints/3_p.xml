<p id="Par10">Venous blood samples for the determination of plerixafor plasma concentrations were collected prior to the first dose of plerixafor on the evening of Day 4, at 0.5, 1, and 4 h post-dose, just prior to the dose of G-CSF on Day 5, and immediately prior to the first apheresis on Day 5. Plasma concentrations were determined by validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry methods (lower limit of quantitation 5 ng/ml). Total systemic exposure to plerixafor was determined by assessment of the area under the concentration–time curve from 0 to 10 h following administration (AUC
 <sub>0–10</sub>). Estimates of other pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters included maximum observed concentration (
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>max</sub>), time to maximum concentration (

 <sub>max</sub>), and half-life (
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>1/2</sub>). PK parameters were calculated using WinNonlin software (PKDMS Version 2.1 with WinNonlin Professional Version 5.2.1; Pharsight).
