<p>Natural killer cells are known to suppress T cells, but the relative effect on Th cell subsets has not been widely explored. In cell culture experiments, we found that NK cells reduced the proportion of Th17 cells by necrosis in an NKG2D-dependent fashion. Previous studies have reported that NK cell–T cell interactions may result in apoptosis (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), or limit proliferation of T cells (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Here, we only observed necrotic cell death of T cells with no differences in apoptosis or proliferation of Th cells. Th17 cells expressed more MICA than Th1 cells that may account for the higher sensitivity of Th17 cells to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Despite the clear necrotic effects, NK cells caused an early rise in expression of IL-17A and RORγt. Moreover, the IL-17A increase was, in part, mediated by CD58. Thus, NK cells provide early co-stimulation to Th17 cells followed by NKG2D-dependent cytotoxicity. We previously identified a decrease in IL-17A in culture supernatants of PBMC (activated with anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and Th17 polarizing factors) at 12 months post-aHSCT (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). While it is possible that NK cells transiently boosted Th17 responses, the longer-term outcome is that Th17 responses, whether assessed by flow cytometry or ELISA, were reduced in post-aHSCT samples. Further examination of the aHSCT MS samples showed a very low level (&lt;1%) of CD58
 <sup>+</sup> NK cells, and this value increased slightly by month 15 post therapy. It is not clear that this has a biologically significant impact on the patients.
