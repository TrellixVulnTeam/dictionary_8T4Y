<p>Our observations add to the growing understanding of how NK cells regulate T cell responses. NK cells can provide co-stimulation and even antigen presentation that activates T cells (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Upon activation, T cells upregulate NKG2D ligands and are then reduced in number through cytotoxic action of NK cells (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). We did not perform kinetics of expression of MICA, however, a previous study showed that T cells only express MICA and related ligands after 3 days of activation, leading to their sensitization to NK cell-mediated killing (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). This timing is consistent with our observations where NK cells were initially costimulatory, and then began to kill by necrosis by the third day of the cell culture experiment. Thus, there is a brief window of time for NK cells to boost Th17 cell responses. In our experiments, the proportion of Th17 cells remaining after NK cell exposure was around 50% which suggests that the purpose of NK cells is to attenuate, but perhaps not fully eliminate, T cell expansion, to preserve immunological memory while preventing uncontrolled T cell activation. This may allow NK cells to accelerate the normal life cycle of Th17 cells by transiently boosting IL-17A expression and secretion, and then accelerating down-regulation of the effector response through cytotoxicity.
