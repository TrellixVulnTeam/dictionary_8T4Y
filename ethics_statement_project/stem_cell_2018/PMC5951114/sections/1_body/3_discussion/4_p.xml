<p>We identified an increase in both CD56
 <sup>bright</sup> and CD56
 <sup>dim</sup> NK cells at 12â€‰months post-aHSCT. Similar conclusions were obtained whether the CD56 intensity or the CD16 expression was used to define NK cell subsets. The ratio of CD56
 <sup>bright</sup> NK cells was substantially increased from month 3 to month 6 after the therapy suggesting that they replenished faster than the CD56
 <sup>dim</sup> NK cells. From our phenotype data it is not possible to draw conclusions about the functional properties of NK cell subsets. In an elegant study by Laroni et al., the two subsets were sorted from healthy donors and their cytotoxic capacity was compared in the presence of inflammatory cytokines (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The authors found that CD56
 <sup>bright</sup> NK cells were more cytotoxic, and they required pro-inflammatory cytokines to be cytotoxic to human autologous CD4 T cells. However, other studies found comparable cytotoxicity of CD56
 <sup>bright</sup> and CD56
 <sup>dim</sup> NK cells toward human autologous CD4 T cells (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Thus, both subsets can have cytotoxic capacity depending on the protocols used. The ability for NK cells to potentially up- or down-regulate inflammatory T cell responses warrants further detailed investigation into the molecular mechanisms of NK cell-T cell interactions, and into their clinical relevance for novel therapeutic strategies.
