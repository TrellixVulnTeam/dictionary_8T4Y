<p>Multiple sclerosis patients were serially enrolled in the immune monitoring sub study as part of the Canadian Collaborative MS/BMT Study (registered at 
 <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">ClinicalTrials.gov</uri>, NCT01099930), following informed consent as approved by the institutional ethics review boards. aHSCT therapy was performed on a cohort of MS patients as previously described (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In brief, patients with aggressive disease who were refractory to drug treatments underwent autologous hematopoietic stem cell mobilization using cyclophosphamide and filgrastim followed by stem cell graft collection by peripheral vein leukopheresis. Immune cells were depleted from the graft using CD34 immunomagnetic selection and the graft was cryopreserved. High dose busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and antithymocyte globulin were administered for immune ablation followed by infusion of the thawed CD34 autologous hematopoietic stem cell graft. The detailed protocol, patient characteristics, and clinical results are published elsewhere (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Venous blood was sampled from MS patients within 2 months before aHSCT, then at 3 weeks, 3 months, 12 months, and 21 months following aHSCT. A portion of the blood sample was analyzed by flow cytometry with antibodies for CD3 (UCHT-1), CD56 (B159), CD4 (RPA-T4), CD8 (RPA-T8) (from BD Bioscience; Mississauga, ON, Canada), and CD58 (TS2/9; eBioscience). The remaining blood sample was processed into peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) using Ficoll, aliquoted, and cryopreserved in fetal bovine serum with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide in a cryovial stored in liquid nitrogen.
