<p>Given the limited cell numbers available from aHSCT PBMC samples, we continued to explore the mechanism in a series of cell culture experiments with healthy subjects PBMCs. Healthy PBMCs were fractioned into memory (RO
 <sup>+</sup>RA
 <sup>−</sup>) CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and CD3
 <sup>−</sup>CD56
 <sup>+</sup> NK cells (representative purity confirmation in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A–C). Th cells and NK cells were then activated in co-culture at a 1:1 ratio to approximate the ratio observed in the post-aHSCT clinical trial samples. NK cells caused a 50% decrease in response of Th17 cells (defined as CD3
 <sup>+</sup>CD4
 <sup>+</sup>IL-17A
 <sup>+</sup> IFN-γ
 <sup>−</sup>) when proportion and number were measured using intracellular flow cytometry (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D–I). In the same samples, the Th1/17 cells (CD3
 <sup>+</sup>CD4
 <sup>+</sup>IL-17A
 <sup>+</sup> IFN-γ
 <sup>+</sup>) or Th1 cells (CD3
 <sup>+</sup>CD4
 <sup>+</sup>IL-17A
 <sup>−</sup> IFN-γ
 <sup>+</sup>) were not altered by NK cells, although a trend toward decrease was noted for each (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>H,I). A more detailed time-course analysis showed that NK cells began to decrease the proportion of Th17 cells on day 3, while the proportion of Th1 cells was slightly reduced on days between 2 and 3 (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>J,K). Despite the fact that NK cells reduced the proportion and number of Th17 cells by about 50%, the mean fluorescent intensity of IL-17A inside of Th cells was significantly elevated from 200 MFI (SE 35) up to 283 MFI (SE 74) in the presence of NK cells (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.042). The fluorescent intensity of IFN-γ in Th cells was not significantly altered by the presence of NK cells although a trend toward a reduction was noted, from 682 MFI (SE 85) without NK cells, to 634 MFI (SE 97) with NK cells.
