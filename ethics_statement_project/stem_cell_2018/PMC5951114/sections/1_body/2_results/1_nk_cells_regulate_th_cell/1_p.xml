<p>Serial blood samples were collected before aHSCT, 3 weeks after treatment and then at approximately 3-month intervals thereafter. The number of NK cells began returning toward baseline (BL) levels by 3 months post-ablation, whereas CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell counts did not reach BL levels even at 21 months (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A,B). The relatively rapid return of NK cells during immune-reconstitution may have been due to insensitivity to the chemotherapy or that NK cells or NK cell precursors were present in the graft. The ratio of circulating NK cells to CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells increased from less than 0.2:1 before aHSCT, to a high of 3:1 at 3 months post-aHSCT, and then a steady-state ratio of 1:1 from 12 months post-aHSCT onward (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C). A more detailed analysis of immune cell subsets revealed that frequencies of both the CD56
 <sup>dim</sup> and the CD56
 <sup>bright</sup> NK cell subsets rose sharply between month 3 and month 6 post-aHSCT, and remained elevated until month 18 and were still significantly higher at 12–18 months post-aHSCT samples (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A,B,E). The ratio of NK bright cells (CD3
 <sup>−</sup>CD56
 <sup>bright</sup>/CD3
 <sup>−</sup>CD56
 <sup>dim</sup>) was approximately 0.1 at BL, significantly increased to a ratio of 0.6 from month 3 to 6, and dropped to BL values by 24 months (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>F). We also used CD16 as a defining marker for NK bright and dim cells (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C,D). The CD3
 <sup>−</sup>CD56
 <sup>+</sup>CD16
 <sup>−</sup> NK cells were significantly higher at month 3 until month 12 compared with BL, as were the CD3-CD56
 <sup>+</sup>CD16
 <sup>+</sup> NK cells although they only has a trend to increase from month 3 to month 6 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>G). The ratio of CD3
 <sup>−</sup>CD56
 <sup>+</sup>CD16
 <sup>−</sup> cells (CD3
 <sup>−</sup>CD56
 <sup>+</sup>CD16
 <sup>−</sup>/CD3
 <sup>−</sup>CD56
 <sup>+</sup>CD16
 <sup>+</sup>) was approximately 0.3 at BL, and this ratio rose significantly to about 1.0 from month 3 to month 6, and then declined to BL levels by month 24 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>H). Thus, we found similar conclusions whether the CD56 intensity or the CD16 expression was used to define NK bright and dim cells.
