<p>We next evaluated the relationship between the level of change of NK cells and Th17 responses in the aHSCT samples. The proportional change in Th17 cells was inversely correlated to the change in NK cells in PBMC samples. Patients with a greater increase in NK cells exhibited the greatest reductions in Th17 responses (

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.5679; Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). Within the Th17-polarized cultures, there was a substantial proportion of CD3
 <sup>+</sup>CD4
 <sup>+</sup>IL-17A
 <sup>−</sup> IFN
 <sup>+</sup> cells consistent with Th1 cells. The proportion of Th1 cells was variable, with no overall reduction following aHSCT, and the change in Th1 cells correlated to changes in NK cells, but to a lesser degree than Th17 cells (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). We next sought to determine the effect of NK cells on the induction of T cell responses 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic>. To do this, CD56
 <sup>+</sup> cells were depleted from post-aHSCT PBMC samples, which successfully removed NK cells (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A,C). This procedure also removed CD3
 <sup>+</sup>CD56
 <sup>+</sup> cells, which was a minor population in the post-aHSCT samples (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). The proportion of Th17 cells and Th1 cells was significantly lower in activated PBMC that contained CD56
 <sup>+</sup> cells, compared with CD56-depleted cultures (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). On average, Th17 and Th1 cells were 2.6 and 1.8-fold higher in the absence of CD56
 <sup>+</sup> cells, respectively, suggesting that Th17 cells were more sensitive to the presence of NK cells. Thus, NK cells may contribute to the regulation of T cell subset responses following aHSCT therapy in MS patients.
