<p>When we analyzed the levels of cytokines in cell culture supernatants of activated Th cells exposed to NK cells, we observed significantly higher levels of IL-17A, and IFN-γ (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>A,B). This seemed at odds with a reduced proportion of Th17 cells, however, we noted an increased MFI of IL-17A in the flow cytometry-based analysis suggesting that surviving cells were making more IL-17A. Upon activation, Th cells expressed 
 <italic>RORC</italic> (encodes RORγt) mRNA on day 1 of the experiment, which increased (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>C), and 
 <italic>IL17A</italic> mRNA levels were detected at day 2 and day 3 of the experiment (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>D). With NK cells added, there was more 
 <italic>RORC</italic> on day 1, and more 
 <italic>IL17A</italic> on day 2 and day 3. NK cells cultured on their own with IL-2 (a potent activator of NK cells) exhibited no detectable mRNA for either 
 <italic>RORC</italic> or 
 <italic>IL17A</italic>, indicating that T cells were the likely source of IL-17 in the co-cultures. Intracellular flow cytometry confirmed that the NK cells did not express IL-17A, although they did highly express IFN-γ (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>E,F). One issue regarding measurement of IFN-γ is the presence of IFN-γ neutralizing antibodies used in the Th17 conditions. This lowers the amount of IFN-γ detected by ELISA when compared with cultures without the neutralizing IFN-γ (data not shown). However, the amount of IFN-γ even in the presence of the neutralizing IFN-γ was significantly increased in the presence of NK cells. To investigate the mechanism by which NK cells induced more IL-17A, selected adhesion molecules were studied. We first considered CD54 (ICAM-1), an adhesion molecule found on antigen presenting cells and NK cells. Neutralizing CD54 did not alter the NK cell-mediated transient boost in IL-17A (data not shown). CD58, another adhesion molecule, was expressed by both CD56
 <sup>bright</sup> and CD56
 <sup>dim</sup> NK cells (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>A). The presence of neutralizing antibodies against CD58 in the co-cultures partially attenuated the NK cell-mediated increase in IL-17A (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>B). To determine the expression of CD58 on NK cells from the MS cohort, we stained samples from BL until M24 and analyzed by flow cytometry (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). There was a very low percentage of CD58
 <sup>+</sup> NK cells in these samples (less than 1% of total PBMC), this proportion was not changed at M12, and significantly higher by M15–M24 compared with BL although remaining below 1% of PBMC.
