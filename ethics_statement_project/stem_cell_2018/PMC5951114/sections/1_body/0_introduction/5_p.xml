<p>Given the importance of NK cells in MS as well as their capacity to limit effector T cell responses, we questioned whether the decrease in Th17 responses after aHSCT, occurs as a result of NK cell-mediated restriction of the generation and/or maintenance of Th17 cells in the early reconstituting immune repertoire. NK cells are known to reconstitute rapidly following allogeneic stem cell transplantation for leukemia (

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In this study, we demonstrated that NK cells were elevated in aHSCT samples.
