<p>Several lines of evidence indicate that NK cells play a protective role in autoimmunity. Depletion or removal of NK cells exacerbates collagen-induced arthritis (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), a transfer model of colitis (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Furthermore, dysregulation or impairment of NK cells has been linked to MS relapses and MRI lesions (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The mechanism by which NK cell dysfunction contributes to MS is still unclear, but may include loss of cytotoxic capacity against autologous T cells (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Following activation, effector T cells are sensitized to NKG2D-dependent cytotoxicity by upregulating NKG2D ligands (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Given their regulatory capacity, NK cells are potential therapeutic targets in autoimmune diseases including MS. Several MS therapeutics limit MS disease activity and concomitantly expand NK CD56
 <sup>bright</sup> cells, including daclizumab (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), alemtuzumab (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), dimethylfumarate (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), and IFN-β (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). NK cells are also capable of injuring astrocytes and neurons (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and promoting demyelination (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Their overall contribution to autoimmunity is thus a balance of immune-regulatory and pro-inflammatory actions.
