<p>Natural killer (NK) cells are part of the innate immune system, specialized in killing virus-infected cells and tumors through several mechanisms and receptors including NKG2D-dependent cytotoxicity. Infected or stressed cells express ligands for NKG2D including MICA, MICB, and the ULBP ligands. In addition, NK cells can regulate adaptive immunity (

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). There are at least two major subtypes of NK cells in humans referred to as CD56
 <sup>bright</sup> and CD56
 <sup>dim</sup> NK cells, circulating in blood and located within tissues (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). They are discernable by flow cytometry based on their relative intensity of CD56 expression. In blood, about 90% of NK cells are expected to be CD56
 <sup>dim</sup> NK cells, this proportion varies for NK cells within tissues (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The traditional view was that CD56
 <sup>dim</sup> NK cells are cytotoxic while CD56
 <sup>bright</sup> NK cells played more of a regulatory role, however, CD56
 <sup>bright</sup> NK cells can acquire cytotoxic properties, and both types can produce cytokines (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). NK cells can also be subdivided based on CD16, a low affinity Fc receptor. CD56
 <sup>dim</sup> NK cells are predominantly CD16
 <sup>+</sup> with only a minor proportion that are CD56
 <sup>dim</sup>CD16
 <sup>−</sup>, and CD56
 <sup>bright</sup> NK cells are mostly CD56
 <sup>bright</sup>CD16
 <sup>−</sup> with a minor population expressing intermediate levels of CD16, referred to as CD56
 <sup>bright</sup>CD16
 <sup>dim</sup> (
