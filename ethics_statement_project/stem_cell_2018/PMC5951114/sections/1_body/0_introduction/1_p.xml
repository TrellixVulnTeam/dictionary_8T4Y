<p>Pro-inflammatory helper T (Th) cells contribute to disease activity in several autoimmune inflammatory conditions including multiple sclerosis (MS). In MS, Th1 and Th17 subsets have been considered pathogenic, while Th2 and regulatory T cell subsets may limit disease activity (

These cells, including those co-expressing IL-17 and IFN-γ, have the capacity to disrupt the blood–brain barrier and directly injure neurons, and therefore have been of particular interest in the study of MS (
