<p>Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT) as a treatment for relapsing remitting MS, has been tested in several clinical trials and has been found to be effective at inducing prolonged disease stabilization (

 <sup>+</sup> aHSCT. In this open label study, treatment resulted in complete abrogation of all clinical relapses and there were no new brain MRI lesions with follow-up now exceeding 13 years (

The concept behind aHSCT therapy in MS is to ablate the existing pathogenic immune cells with the induction chemotherapy regimen and then allow reconstitution of a newly derived, non-pathogenic, autologous immune repertoire by the transplanted stem cells. Studies carried out following aHSCT demonstrated that central nervous system-reactive Th1 cells re-emerged to levels that were indistinguishable from those documented before the treatment. By contrast, Th17 responses, including IL-17 secretion, were much reduced in the reconstituted immune system following aHSCT (
