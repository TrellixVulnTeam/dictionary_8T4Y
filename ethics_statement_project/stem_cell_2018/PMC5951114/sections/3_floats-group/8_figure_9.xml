   <sup>+</sup> T cells from healthy subjects PBMC were activated with anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and Th17 polarizing factors with NK cells in the presence or absence of CD58 neutralizing or isotype control antibody for 4 days. The cytokine IL-17A was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from cell culture supernatants
