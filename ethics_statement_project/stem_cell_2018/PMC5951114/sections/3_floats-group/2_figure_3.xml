  <p>Changes in blood natural killer (NK) cell populations correlate with changes in helper T (Th) cells populations following aHSCT in MS patients. MS patient peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from baseline (BL) and 12 month post-aHSCT were activated 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> with anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and Th17 polarizing factors for 4 days. Th17 and Th1 cells were assessed by analysis of cytokine production by intracellular flow cytometry (CD3
