  <p>Rapid reconstitution kinetics of natural killer (NK) cell counts compared with CD4 T cells in aHSCT-treated multiple sclerosis (MS) patient blood. From freshly drawn blood samples, absolute number of NK cell counts 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cell counts 
   <bold>(B)</bold> were determined at baseline (BL), and at 3 weeks (3 W), 3 months (3 M), 12 months (12 M), and 21 months (21 M) post-aHSCT. The ratio of NK cells to CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cells was calculated 
   <bold>(C)</bold>. 
   <italic>N</italic> = 7 patients.
