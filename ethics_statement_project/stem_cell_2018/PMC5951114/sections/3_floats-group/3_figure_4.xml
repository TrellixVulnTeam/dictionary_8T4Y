   <sup>+</sup> cells suppress Th17 and Th1 cell responses in aHSCT. CD56
   <sup>+</sup> cells were depleted from MS patient PBMC samples collected at 12 months post-aHSCT. Representative plots are shown for complete 
   <bold>(A,B)</bold> and CD56-depleted samples 
   <bold>(C,D)</bold>. Cells were activated 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> with anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and Th17 polarizing factors (Act) for 4 days. The proportions of Th17 and Th1 cells were assessed by analysis of cytokine production by intracellular flow cytometry. Representative plots are shown for complete samples 
   <bold>(B)</bold> and CD56-depleted samples 
   <bold>(D)</bold>. The average proportion of Th17 
   <bold>(E)</bold> or Th1 cells 
   <bold>(F)</bold> is shown. 
   <italic>N</italic> = 3 patients.
