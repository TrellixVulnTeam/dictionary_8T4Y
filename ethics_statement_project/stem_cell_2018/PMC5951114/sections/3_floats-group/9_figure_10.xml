  <p>CD58 expression levels on natural killer (NK) cells before and after aHSCT treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) from the aHSCT cohort of MS patients was stained for CD3, CD56, and CD58. Representative plots for CD56 and CD58 are shown for baseline (BL) 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and month 21 [M21; 
   <bold>(B)</bold>]. A time series of samples from BL until month 24 (M24) is presented 
   <bold>(C)</bold>. For statistical analysis, the time points were grouped in M3–M6, M9–M12, M15–M18, and M21–M24, followed by univariate one-way ANOVA with pairwise comparisons with the BL values. 
   <italic>N</italic> = 7 patients.
