  <p>Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic toward helper T (Th) cells through necrosis but not apoptosis. Memory CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cells from healthy subject PBMC were activated with anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and Th17 polarizing factors, either in the absence or presence of NK cells for 4 days. Samples were stained with CD3, CD56, 7AAD, and annexin V. Representative plots of T cells (CD4
   <sup>+</sup>CD56
   <sup>−</sup>) cultured without 
   <bold>(A)</bold> or with NK cells 
   <bold>(B)</bold> are shown. The average proportion of necrotic (7-AAD
   <sup>+</sup>annexinV
   <sup>+</sup>) T cells is shown 
   <bold>(C)</bold>. Open bars = memory CD4 T cells, closed bars = memory CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cells plus NK cells. 
   <italic>N</italic> = 8 samples. A time-course analysis of apoptotic (7-AAD
   <sup>−</sup>annexin V
   <sup>+</sup>) T cells is shown 
   <bold>(D)</bold>. Open circles indicate memory CD4 T cells alone and filled squares indicate T cells plus NK cells.
