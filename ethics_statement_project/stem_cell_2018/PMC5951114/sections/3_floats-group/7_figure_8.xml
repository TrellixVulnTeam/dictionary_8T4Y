  <p>Natural killer (NK) cells augment IL-17A and 
   <italic>RORC</italic> levels in memory CD4 T cells. Purified memory CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cells from healthy subject PBMCs were activated with anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and Th17 polarizing factors without (open diamond) or with NK cells (closed square). Cytokines IL-17A 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and IFN-γ 
   <bold>(B)</bold> were measured in the supernatant by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of 
   <italic>RORC</italic>
   <bold>(C)</bold> and 
   <italic>IL17A</italic>
   <bold>(D)</bold> mRNA was measured by qPCR at the indicated time points. Data are representative of three samples. Groups included non-activated memory CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cells (T nil; closed circles), activated memory CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cells (T; open circle), activated memory CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cells with NK cells (T NK; closed squares), and NK cells cultured alone with IL-2 (NK IL-2; open squares). Representative plots of IL-17A and IFN-γ expression in NK cells (CD3
   <sup>−</sup>CD56
   <sup>+</sup>) are shown 
   <bold>(E,F)</bold>.
