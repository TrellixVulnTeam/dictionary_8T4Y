  <p>The proportions of CD56
   <sup>dim</sup> and CD56
   <sup>bright</sup> natural killer (NK) cells are higher post-aHSCT compared witho baseline (BL). Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) from aHSCT-treated MS patients was analyzed by flow cytometry. Representative plots for BL 
   <bold>(A,C)</bold>, and month 12 [M12; 
   <bold>(B,D)</bold>] stained for CD3 and CD56 
   <bold>(A,B)</bold>, gated on CD3
   <sup>−</sup>CD56
   <sup>+</sup>, then shown as CD56 with CD16 
   <bold>(C,D)</bold>. Example gates for CD56
   <sup>bright</sup> and CD56
   <sup>dim</sup> are shown. Additional time points include BL, and serial samples approximately every 3 months for up to 24 months post-aHSCT. The average proportions of total NK cells as well as CD56
   <sup>dim</sup> and CD56
   <sup>bright</sup> NK cell subsets expressed as a proportion of total PBMC 
   <bold>(E)</bold>. The ratio of NK cells with the CD56
   <sup>bright</sup> phenotype calculated as CD56
   <sup>bright</sup>/CD56
   <sup>dim</sup> NK cells 
   <bold>(F)</bold>. The proportions of NK cells with CD16
   <sup>+</sup> or CD16
   <sup>−</sup> phenotype expressed as a proportion of total PBMC 
   <bold>(G)</bold>. The ratio of gated NK cells with the CD16
   <sup>−</sup> phenotype calculated as CD16
   <sup>−</sup>/CD16
   <sup>+</sup>
   <bold>(H)</bold>. 
   <italic>N</italic> = 7 patients. For statistical analysis, the time points were grouped in M3–M6, M9–M12, M15–M18, and M21–M24, followed by univariate one-way ANOVA with pairwise comparisons with the BL values.
