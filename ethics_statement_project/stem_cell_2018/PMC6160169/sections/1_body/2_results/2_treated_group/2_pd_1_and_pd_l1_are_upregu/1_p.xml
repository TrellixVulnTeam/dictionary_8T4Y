<p>More cases showed an upregulation rather than a downregulation in the relapse biopsy compared to the primary biopsy for all markers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204870.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). For PD-1+ leukocytes, 19 cases (63%) showed a proportional increase, 7 (23%) a decreased expression, and 4 (13%) remained unchanged in the relapse biopsy compared to the primary biopsy, median proportion was 1% in the primary biopsy and 3% in the relapse biopsy (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204870.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). For PD-L1+ leukocytes, 22 cases (73%) had an increased expression, 7 (23%) a decreased expression, and 1 (3%) remained unchanged in the relapse biopsy compared to the primary biopsy, median proportion was 24% in the primary biopsy and 30.5% in the relapse biopsy (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204870.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). For PD-L1+ HRS cells, 18 cases (60%) had an increased expression, 3 (10%) a decreased expression, and 9 (30%) remained unchanged in the relapse biopsy compared to the primary biopsy, median proportion was 77.5% in the primary biopsy and 80% in the relapse biopsy (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204870.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The increases between the primary and relapse biopsies were statistically significantly different considering PD-1+ leukocytes (p = 0.04), PD-L1+ leukocytes (p = 0.005), and PD-L1+ HRS cells (p = 0.009) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204870.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In addition, we observed that all 30 (100%) relapse biopsies expressed PD-L1 on the HRS cells to some degree (&gt;0%), while it was expressed to some degree in 26 (87%) of the primary biopsies (
