<p>For PD-1+ leukocytes, 4 (36%) cases had an increased expression, 5 (45%) a decreased expression, and 2 (18%) remained unchanged in biopsy 2 compared to biopsy 1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204870.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), median proportion was 5% in biopsy 1 and 1% in biopsy 2. For PD-L1+ leukocytes, 8 (73%) had an increased and 3 (27%) had a decreased expression in biopsy 2 compared to biopsy 1, median proportion was 14% in biopsy 1 and 13% in biopsy 2 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204870.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). With Wilcoxon signed-rank test, there were no statistically significant differences considering the median difference between biopsy 1 and biopsy 2 considering PD-1+ leukocytes (p = 0.95), PD-L1+ leukocytes (p = 0.21), or PD-L1+ HRS cells (p = 0.36). Examples of immunohistochemically stained slides with PD-1 for case 9 (
