<p>To summarize the previous paragraphs: upregulation of PD-1 and PD-L1 can be explained by a more pronounced inflammatory microenvironment following longer disease duration, changed microenvironmental milieu in the relapsed setting, or the primary treatment. The median time between the primary and the relapse biopsy in the treated group was considerably longer than the median time between biopsy 1 and biopsy 2 in the untreated group, 36 and 5 months, respectively. Thus, it is difficult to determine whether it is the treatment, disease progression, altered conditions in the relapsed microenvironment, or all combined that are most important for the upregulation of PD-1 and PD-L1.</p>
