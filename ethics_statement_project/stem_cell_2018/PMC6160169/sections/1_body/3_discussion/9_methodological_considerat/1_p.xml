<p>Both lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells (i.e. macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells) are able to express both PD-1 and PD-L1 in malignancies[
 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Since it is troublesome to differentiate large lymphocytes from small macrophages and monocytes based solely on morphologic examination, we decided to adapt a summary measure and term them as leukocytes. However, it is known that PD-1 is mostly expressed by T-cells, and PD-L1 is mostly expressed by macrophages in cHL[
 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This seemed true in our material in general when manually evaluated, which is also exemplified in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204870.g003">Fig 3</xref> where PD-1 is mainly expressed by smaller lymphocytes, and PD-L1 is mainly expressed by larger macrophages. Hence, our PD-1 findings are mostly based on expression by lymphocytes while PD-L1 findings are mostly based on expression by macrophages.
