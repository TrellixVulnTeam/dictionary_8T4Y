<p>Core needle biopsies may contain insufficient material to diagnose lymphomas[
 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, for the 
 <italic>untreated</italic> group, only biopsy 1 for case 3 and 4, and biopsy 2 for case 10 (
 <xref rid="pone.0204870.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) were core needle biopsies, while the rest were whole lymph node excisions. Hence, in most cases the original misclassification is probably not explained by inadequate material provided in biopsy 1. HRS cells have a distinct immunohistochemical profile, being positive for CD30 and PAX5[
 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For biopsy 1, only 2 cases were examined with immunohistochemical markers in the original diagnostic process. Most of the cases not examined with immunohistochemistry were diagnosed prior to the year 2000 (
 <xref rid="pone.0204870.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), when immunohistochemistry was less commonly used. We reclassified 38% of the first biopsies as cHL, likely explained by our utilization of immunohistochemical markers in combination with a confirmatory biopsy with cHL in biopsy 2, which simplified our review procedure compared to the original diagnostic procedure.
