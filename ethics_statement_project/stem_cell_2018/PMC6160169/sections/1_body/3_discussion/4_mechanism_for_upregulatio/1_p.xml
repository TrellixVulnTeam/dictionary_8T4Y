<p>An upregulation of PD-L1 on HRS cells at relapse might include several mechanisms, mainly genetic alterations following anti-cancer treatment, but may also reflect longer disease duration. As mentioned previously, how contemporary front-line chemotherapy regimens alter the PD-1 pathway in cHL has never been investigated earlier. However, treatment has been associated with an increased expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells in other malignancies. In a mouse breast cancer model, radiotherapy upregulated expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells[
