<p>This is the first study to describe that PD-1 and PD-L1 are upregulated in relapsed cHL compared to primary diagnosis, and the tendency that PD-L1+ leukocytes are upregulated with time in untreated cHL. This further adds knowledge about the complex inflammatory infiltrate orchestrated by the PD-1 pathway in cHL. Future studies are warranted to elucidate whether it is longer disease duration, primary treatment, or altered conditions in the relapse microenvironment that upregulate the PD-1 pathway. However, based on numerous previous studies[

 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], PD-1 and PD-L1 are most likely upregulated due to previous treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which could have implications regarding treatment with PD-1 inhibition in cHL.
