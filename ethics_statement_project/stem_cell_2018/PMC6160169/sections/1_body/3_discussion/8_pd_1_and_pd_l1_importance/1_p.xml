<p>In a previous study, we found that high proportions of PD-1+ and PD-L1+ leukocytes in primary tumors with cHL were associated with inferior outcome, while expression of PD-L1 on HRS cells had no impact on outcome[

In the current study, no association with survival according to high vs low expression of PD-1+ and PD-L1+ leukocytes, and PD-L1+ HRS cells was found. However, only 27% of the patients in our cohort died, thus a considerably lower proportion in comparison with a large retrospective Swedish cohort where approximately 50% of the patients died following relapse[

Re-biopsied patients are probably more prone to receive treatment with curative intent, than patients for whom a new biopsy of a suspected relapse is not performed. Thus, our material likely favored to mainly include young and healthy individuals with little comorbidity.
