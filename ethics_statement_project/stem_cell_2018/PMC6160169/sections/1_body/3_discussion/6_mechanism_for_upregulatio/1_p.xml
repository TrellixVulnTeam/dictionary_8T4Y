<p>PD-1 is expressed by different activated leukocytes (e.g. lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages), and is upregulated on T cells following persistent exposure to antigens[

 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This was also seen in the study on the colorectal cancer mouse model[
 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], where PD-1+ macrophages were upregulated following longer disease duration without treatment. In addition, patients with relapsed multiple myeloma had a more pronounced infiltration of PD-1+ lymphocytes after than before treatment[
 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Increased proportions of PD-1+ leukocytes in relapsed cases in the 
 <italic>treated</italic> group might thus be a result of persistent or previous exposure to antigens.
