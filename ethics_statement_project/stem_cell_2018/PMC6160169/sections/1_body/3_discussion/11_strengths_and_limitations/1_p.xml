<p>To our knowledge, no previous publication has investigated the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in repeated biopsies in patients with cHL. However, due to treatment recommendations advocating immediate treatment in HL, only 11 cases had consecutive biopsies where patients remained untreated, despite screening 3500 cases. This limited the statistical power and our results should be viewed as hypothesis generating. For all patients in the 
 <italic>untreated</italic> group, both biopsy 1 and biopsy 2 were taken from the same location, minimizing the bias of possibly different composition of the microenvironment in the same patient between different localizations. The unique material and design of our study make an important knowledge contribution regarding immune checkpoint regulation in cHL.
