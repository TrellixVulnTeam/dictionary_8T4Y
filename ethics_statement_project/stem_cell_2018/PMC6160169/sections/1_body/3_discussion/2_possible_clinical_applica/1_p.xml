<p>Upregulation of the PD-1 pathway is primarily of biologic interest, but could also be relevant when PD-1 blockade is tested as front-line treatment[
 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. PD-1 blockade is only currently routinely used in refractory and relapsed cHL, with high treatment response rates[
 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], particularly in those with high expression of PD-L1 on HRS cells[
 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In other malignancies, conventional chemotherapy upregulates expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells in cases of primary head and neck cancer[
 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and lung adenocarcinoma[
 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is unknown whether conventional front-line chemotherapy and radiotherapy upregulates expression of PD-L1 on HRS cells in cHL, however our findings with a higher expression of PD-L1 in relapsed than in primary biopsies indicate such an association. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with Richter transformation, high overall expression of PD-1 and PD-L1, and prior treatment with ibrutinib resulted in a more favorable response to PD-1 inhibition[
 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The most suitable chemotherapy and radiotherapy in combination with PD-1 inhibition, and optimal sequences between chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and PD-1 inhibition should be further explored in clinical trials.
