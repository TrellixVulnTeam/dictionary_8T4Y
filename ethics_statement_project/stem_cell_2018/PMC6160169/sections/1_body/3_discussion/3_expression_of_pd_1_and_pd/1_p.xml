<p>Most (60â€“73%) patients in the 
 <italic>treated</italic> group had a higher expression of each marker in their relapse biopsy compared to their primary biopsy, demonstrating that the PD-1 pathway appears to be upregulated at relapse in cHL. We also found that all relapse biopsies expressed PD-L1 in the HRS cells at least to some degree, which is compatible with previous studies where PD-L1 was expressed by HRS cells in all relapsed cases with cHL[

 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The findings were less convincing for the 
 <italic>untreated</italic> group; nevertheless 73% of the patients had an increased proportion of PD-L1+ leukocytes in biopsy 2 compared to biopsy 1, indicating that also disease progression itself, and not only treatment might upregulate PD-L1 expression in leukocytes. EBV was present in the HRS cells in 3 cases in the 
 <italic>untreated</italic> group, but there was no change in EBV status when biopsy 1 and biopsy 2 were compared.
