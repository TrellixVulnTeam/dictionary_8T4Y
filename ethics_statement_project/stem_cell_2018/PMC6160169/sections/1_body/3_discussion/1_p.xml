<p>This study describes the biologic variation over time of the PD-1 pathway in cHL. In paired biopsies from previously 
 <italic>untreated</italic> and previously 
 <italic>treated</italic> patients with primary and relapsed cHL, respectively, we found that PD-1 and PD-L1 were upregulated in the relapsed (
 <italic>treated)</italic> group, and a tendency that PD-L1+ leukocytes were upregulated in the 
 <italic>untreated</italic> group (
