<p>cHL is characterized by an extensive inflammatory infiltrate consisting of various leukocytes[
 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In malignant diseases, PD-1 ligands become upregulated on leukocytes in the tumor microenvironment by various pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g. interferon γ, interleukin 10, and tumor necrosis factor α, produced by tumor cells and other leukocytes such as T cells[

 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thus, a more pro-inflammatory tumor milieu is a plausible explanation for our findings, i.e. a higher proportion of PD-L1+ leukocytes in the microenvironment in relapse biopsies in the 
 <italic>treated</italic> group, and an indication of a higher proportion of PD-L1+ leukocytes in the 
 <italic>untreated</italic> group. In addition, in the mouse breast cancer model referred to above, radiotherapy upregulated expression of PD-L1 on dendritic cells[
 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, treatment also likely induces a higher proportion of PD-L1+ leukocytes, as we noted in the 
 <italic>treated</italic> group.
