<p>Pathology records during the years 1980–2015 in three Swedish referral pathology departments (Uppsala, Umeå and Lund) were screened for all cHL cases (n = 3500). Among them, 87 patients diagnosed with primary cHL that had at least one lymph node biopsy taken prior to the cHL diagnostic date were identified. Sections and formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks from these patients were collected and cases with remaining tissue were investigated (

 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is therefore difficult to identify untreated patients with more than one biopsy with primary cHL. To address how PD-1 and PD-L1 varies in repeated biopsies in untreated patients with cHL, we reviewed the lymph node biopsies originally classified as non-malignant in patients that later developed cHL, with the intent that some non-malignant biopsies would be reclassified as cHL. Patients with at least two lymph node biopsies with cHL prior to start of treatment provided 11 paired cases. Patients with a biopsy at the primary diagnosis and a biopsy after primary treatment at relapse provided 30 paired cases (
