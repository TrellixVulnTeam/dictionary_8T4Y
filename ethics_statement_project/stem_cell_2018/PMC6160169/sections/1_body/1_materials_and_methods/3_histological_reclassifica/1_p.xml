<p>Examination of the cases was performed by two of the authors. Of the 87 cases, 30 had insufficient FFPE material, and were excluded from the study. Twenty-nine cases had a lymph node biopsy classified as benign prior to a biopsy with cHL, and 11 (38%) of these were re-classified as cHL in biopsy 1 and confirmed to have cHL in biopsy 2. Since these patients received no treatment after biopsy 1, this group is referred to as the 
 <italic>untreated group</italic>. Thirty paired samples with primary and relapsed cHL were confirmed during the diagnostic review. Since these patients received treatment after their primary diagnostic biopsy, this group is referred to as the 
 <italic>treated group</italic>. Two patients were included in both the 
 <italic>untreated</italic> and the 
 <italic>treated</italic> group since they had tumor material available in biopsy 1 and biopsy 2, and also a biopsy of a subsequent relapse (
