<p>As part of the diagnostic review, complementary immunohistochemical double-stainings for CD30 and paired box 5 protein (PAX5) were performed when needed. Cases were immunohistochemically stained with the Intellipath FLX automated staining system (Biocare Medical, Pacheco, CA). Single staining for PD-1 and double stainings for PD-L1/PAX5, and CD30/PAX5 were performed using 4 μm FFPE whole tumor sections. PD-1 was visualized with the mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) NAT105/ab52587 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), PD-L1 with the rabbit mAb E1L3N/13684 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), CD30 with the mouse mAb Ber-H2/IR602 (Dako, Santa Clara, CA). Two antibodies were used for PAX5 depending on whether it was double stained for PD-L1 or CD30, because the anti-PD-L1 was a rabbit antibody and the anti-CD30 was a mouse antibody. With PD-L1, PAX5 was visualized with the mouse mAb M7307/DAK-Pax5 (Dako), and with CD30, PAX5 was visualized with the rabbit polyclonal antibody ab140341 (Abcam). All antibodies were diluted 1:50. Antigen for PD-1 was retrieved in citrate buffer, and PD-L1, CD30 and both PAX5s were retrieved in TE buffer in a pressure cooker. PD-1 and CD30 were envisioned with MACH3 mouse HRP reagents (brown) (Biocare Medical), PD-L1 was envisioned with the Betazoid DAB detection kit (brown) (Biocare Medical), and both PAX5s were envisioned with the Warp Red chromogen (Biocare Medical). Finally, the sections were counterstained with Intellipath FLX´s hematoxylin.</p>
