<p>The proportions of PD-1+ and PD-L1+ leukocytes, and PD-L1+ HRS cells were manually quantified in 5 high power fields (HPF) at 400x (0.0625mm
 <sup>2</sup>). HPFs with visible HRS cells and most prevalent infiltration of PD-1+ or PD-L1+ cells were chosen and fibrosis was avoided. Cells with at least weak membranous staining for each marker were designated as positive, while other cells were designated as negative. The proportions were calculated by dividing the number of positive leukocytes by the total number of leukocytes (positive and negative), and the number of positive HRS cells by the total number of HRS cells. To investigate whether longer disease duration affected expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in the 
 <italic>untreated</italic> group, cases were grouped into short vs long duration between biopsy 1 and biopsy 2. The cut-off was set at the median time between biopsy 1 and biopsy 2, which was 5 months. To elucidate the prognostic impact regarding expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in relapsed tumor samples, we applied cut-offs for the relapsed cases in the 
 <italic>treated group</italic>, set at the 75
 <sup>th</sup> percentile in order to divide patients into high vs low expression. High vs low proportion of PD-1+ leukocytes was defined as ≥5% vs &lt;5% PD-1+ leukocytes. High vs low proportion of PD-L1+ leukocytes was defined as ≥46% vs &lt;46% PD-L1+ leukocytes. High vs low proportion of PD-L1+ HRS cells was defined as ≥94% vs &lt;94% PD-L1+ HRS cells.
