<p>Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) has an overall good prognosis, but a proportion of patients suffer from refractory disease or relapse, with an increased risk of early death[
 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) are expressed to variable degrees in inflammatory conditions[

 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and malignancies[

 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1 pathway are effective treatment options in relapsed and refractory cHL[
 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but in first line the efficacy of these drugs is unknown. Consequently, the biological dynamicity of the PD-1 pathway in cHL during disease progression needs to be described. Patients with primary cHL with high proportions of both PD-1+ and PD-L1+ leukocytes have inferior outcome[
 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but nothing has been published about how expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 evolves over time and when primary and relapse biopsies are compared.
