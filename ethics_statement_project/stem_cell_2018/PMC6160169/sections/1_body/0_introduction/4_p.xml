<p>Our aim was to determine how expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 develops both during disease progression in a unique material of 
 <italic>untreated</italic> patients, and in primary 
 <italic>treated</italic> patients that relapsed. Additionally, we wanted to explore whether expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in relapse samples was related to survival after relapse. Our hypothesis was that higher proportions of PD-1+ and PD-L1+ leukocytes and PD-L1+ HRS cells would be associated with longer disease duration and relapse.
