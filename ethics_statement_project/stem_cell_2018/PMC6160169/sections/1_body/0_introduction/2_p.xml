<p>cHL is characterized by a tumor microenvironment that consists of a variable infiltration of different leukocytes and few malignant Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells[

 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This is a defining feature[
 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which distinguishes cHL from other malignancies. Only a few studies have investigated how PD-1 and PD-L1 changes over time in other 
 <italic>untreated</italic> malignant tumors. Higher proportions of PD-1+ macrophages in colorectal carcinoma have been associated with a longer disease duration[
 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In a previous study from our research group, there was a tendency for patients with cHL with high proportions of PD-L1+ leukocytes to present with advanced tumor stage[
 <xref rid="pone.0204870.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It has never been studied whether PD-1 and PD-L1 are heterogeneously expressed in paired biopsies from patients with 
 <italic>untreated</italic> cHL.
