<p>In this study, allogeneic MSCs will be used. Use of autologous cells seems preferable for immunological reasons, as enhanced clearance of allogeneic cells has been suggested, possibly through formation of alloreactive antibodies.
 <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> However, the use of autologous cells may have disadvantages, as MSCs obtained from patients with SSc may have reduced vasculoregenerative properties and may have been affected by disease. SSc MSCs display a different phenotype compared with MSCs from healthy controls and have a reduced capacity to differentiate into endothelial cells.
 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48 49</xref> MSCs from patients with SSc also overexpress proangiogenic and profibrotic factors.
 <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> They also express more transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) type II receptors and produce more collagen-α2 mRNA on TGF-β stimulation, a pathway implicated in the development of fibrosis.
 <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Preclinical studies with timed chemotherapeutic ablation of MSCs have shown that permanent integration of MSCs is not required for sustained therapeutic effects.
 <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> In a patient population where aberrant fibroblastic differentiation and fibrosis are theoretical risks, enhanced clearance of the allograft are likely even desirable. Lastly, the use of autologous MSCs requires bone marrow aspiration and cell culture, which is an additional burden for the patient, increases costs and delays treatment.
