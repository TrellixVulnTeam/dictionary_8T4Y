<p>The MSCs to be used in this study (product name: MSC, marrow) are harvested from bone marrow donated by voluntary donors. Donors are screened for infectious diseases as indicated by the Wet Veiligheid en Kwaliteit Lichaamsmaterialen, the transposition into Dutch law of the European Union directive 2006/17. MSCs are expanded and processed by the University Medical Center Utrecht Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certified Cell Therapy Facility. After harvesting, the cells are expanded ex vivo in alpha-minimum essential medium containing 5% human platelet lysate. Before release, the product is tested for bacterial/fungal contamination and endotoxins. MSCs were expanded ex vivo until passage 3 and cryopreserved until use. Cells from two different donors will be used. The product to be administered to patients will be thawed on the day of treatment, washed to remove the cryopreservant dimethyl sulfoxide and resuspended in NaCl 0.9% containing 10% human serum albumin. The placebo will consist of NaCl 0.9% and 10% human serum albumin. Syringes will be blinded.</p>
