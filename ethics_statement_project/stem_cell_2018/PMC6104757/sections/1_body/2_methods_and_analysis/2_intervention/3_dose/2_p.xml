<p>MSC doses in clinical trials for critical limb ischaemia of the lower limb ranged from 1*10
 <sup>6</sup> to 900*10
 <sup>6</sup>.
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 33</xref> To reduce the risk of injection-related complications, we have decided to use fewer injection sites compared with other studies in which cells are injected into the upper extremity. This number of sites limits the amount of cells that can be injected. At a total dose of 50*10
 <sup>6</sup> cells, our dose is in the lower range. Animal and human studies with a dose-finding component have previously shown that high cell doses do not necessarily lead to better efficacy, but even suggested an inverse doseâ€“response effect. Cell crowding is thought to play a role.
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38 54 60</xref> The number of MSCs per injection in our protocol does not exceed doses used in literature despite the reduction of injection sites.
