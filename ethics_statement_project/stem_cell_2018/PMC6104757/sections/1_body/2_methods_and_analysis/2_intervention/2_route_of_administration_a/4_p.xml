<p>Clinical studies in patients with ischaemia or ulcers of the lower extremity in which cells were injected intramuscularly report injection sites both close to and at a distance from the ulcers. Only very few studies reported on local injections in the upper extremity and protocols differed widely with regard to the location and the number of injections. On assessing these protocols, we found that in some instances it can be questioned whether these were true intramuscular injections, or the injection sites were close to essential structures which might pose a safety risk, or the location would provide insufficient space to harbour an injected volume.</p>
