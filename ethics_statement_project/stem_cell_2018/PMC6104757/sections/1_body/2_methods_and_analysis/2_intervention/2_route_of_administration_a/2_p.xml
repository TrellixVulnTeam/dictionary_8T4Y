<p>First, in patients with vascular complications of SSc, the peripheral perfusion is compromised by the very nature of their disease. Intramuscular administration bypasses this problem altogether by delivering the cells closer to the ulcer site. Second, muscle tissue supports intramuscular-injected MSCs with nutrients and oxygen, which benefits the survival and in vivo functions of MSC.
 <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> Thirdly, intramuscular injection may also be safer in patients with SSc, as intravenous administration in both preclinical and clinical studies has been shown to lead to entrapping of MSCs in the lungs.
 <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55 56</xref> While no pulmonary embolism or other pulmonary pathology were reported in clinical studies conducted so far, pulmonary trapping of MSC seems less desirable in a patient population at risk for pulmonary pathology, such as patients with SSc.
