<p>TheÂ 
 <italic>N</italic> of 20 is based on the number of patients that we can realistically recruit from our own population and collaborating centres. This number will allow us to detect which, if any, SAEs may occur and will provide a rough estimate of effect size that may inform the design of future studies. To be able to determine statistically significant differences with regard to safety and efficacy, much larger groups will likely be needed. However, to be able to include such a number of patients, an international multicentre trial would need to be initiated. This would require more solid indications regarding the safety and potential efficacy of MSCs in SSc, as may be provided by the proposed study.
