<p>Participants will be randomised in blocks by the Department of Clinical Pharmacy using a computerised table, with the block size unknown to the investigators. The treatment allocation will be implemented by the Cell Therapy Facility, with no communication of allocation status to the investigational team. Both investigators and participants will be blinded to treatment allocation by the use of a verum and a placebo product that are similar in appearance. In case of an emergency, deblinding can be performed by the Department of Pharmacy.</p>
