<p>Ethical concerns of stem cell therapy due to subjecting the placebo group to an invasive sham procedure were previously explored by our group.
 <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> The risk of complications is considered to be very low, based on studies that already explored intramuscular administration of MSCs in various settings as described previously. Should complications arise, the placebo control will help attributing these to the MSC product or the intramuscular injections per se. Furthermore, as there is no alternative treatment for patients with digital ulcers refractory to intravenous prostanoids, patients are not withheld regular care. There are also no restrictions on the treatment patients may receive prior to participation.
