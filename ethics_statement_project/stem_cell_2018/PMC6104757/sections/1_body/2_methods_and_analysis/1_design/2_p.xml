 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed to select patients with refractory ulcers who are in a reasonable health condition to allow trial participation. Study participants will be recruited from our own SSc outpatient population as well as in collaboration with other scleroderma expert centres, who will refer patients to the University Medical Center Utrecht. Baseline characteristics will be collected, including parameters that were shown to predict ulcer healing in observational cohorts,

 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref> and
