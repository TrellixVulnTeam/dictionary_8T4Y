<p>The rate of recruitment and willingness to participate in a trial that contains a placebo arm in this pilot will inform our decision regarding recruitment feasibility for a larger trial based on the calculated sample size and recruitment duration. As there will only be 10 patients in the treatment group, we understand that the incidence of adverse events in this trial may be a poor estimate of the expected incidence in a larger trial. If, however, there are any serious AEs definitely attributable to the treatment according to the WHO guidelines for pharmacovigilance, we will reconsider the definitive trial or its design.</p>
