<p>Evaluation of therapies for digital ulcers has been complicated by a lack of suitable outcomes.
 <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60 61</xref> To assess potentially relevant outcome measures for efficacy, we will use validated questionnaires for quality of life, hand function and detailed ulcer observations. Currently, the relation between the Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire (S-HAQ) and other quality-of-life questionnaires and ulcer-related hand function is unsureâ€”the only validated efficacy parameter for digital ulcer treatments in SSc is the number of ulcers and ulcer healing.
 <xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> In the MANUS Trial, we will therefore use these questionnaires to further explore the effect of digital ulcers on disability and quality of life.
