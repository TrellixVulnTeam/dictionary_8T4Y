<p>Nailfold capillaroscopy (NFC) is a reproducible non-invasive method to visualise the nailfold capillaries and assess microvascular morphology. Images will be scored both qualitatively as well as semiquantitatively, using standardised and previously validated methods.
 <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65 66</xref> It has been shown that therapy directed to the microvasculature can lead to favourable changes in the NFC pattern in SSc, though it is uncertain when the effects will be first apparent.
 <xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67 68</xref> Therefore, NFC will be conducted at 2, 12, 24 and 52 weeks.
