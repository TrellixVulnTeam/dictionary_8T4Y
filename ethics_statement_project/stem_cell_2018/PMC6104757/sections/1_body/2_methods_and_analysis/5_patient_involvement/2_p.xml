<p>A patient advocate is part of the Trial End User Committee, which meets once a year and includes rheumatology experts, regenerative medicine experts and intellectual property advisors. The research protocol and the patient letter/informedâ€‰consent form has been discussed with this patient advocate, who is a member of the NVLE (Dutch association for scleroderma, systemic lupus and MCTD). The NVLE has kindly agreed to post information (which has been ethically approved prior to publication) about the trial on their website. The results of the study will be disseminated to the study participants through a newsletter and a patient information day. The burden of the intervention has not been assessed by patients themselves.</p>
