<p>Here, we describe the protocol and the rationale for the MANUS (
 <italic>M</italic>esenchymal stromal cells for 
 <italic>A</italic>ngiogenesis and 
 <italic>N</italic>eovascularization in digital 
 <italic>U</italic>lcers of 
 <italic>S</italic>ystemic Sclerosis) Trial. The MANUS Trial is an investigator-initiated phase IIa/b randomised placebo-controlled double-blind trial, in which we will evaluate the safety, feasibility and potential efficacy of intramuscular administration of allogeneic MSCs as treatment for digital ulcers caused by SSc. If the results confirm safety, feasibility and show potential beneficial effects of the intervention regarding clinical parameters, a large multicentre RCT with longer follow-up will be initiated focusing on efficacy.
