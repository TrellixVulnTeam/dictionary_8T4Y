<p>Though there is considerable heterogeneity in the used cell types and administration protocols, these clinical studies in critical limb ischaemia suggest that injection of cell depots in patients with SSc may be a viable possible treatment for digital ulcers caused by SSc. Small uncontrolled studies in SSc show that injection of various autologous cells was well tolerated and did not lead to adverse events; however, local administration of cultured MSCs has not yet been assessed in this condition.
 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Interestingly, two case reports that describe intravenous administration of respectively autologous or allogeneic MSCs report a marked effect on ulcer healing, reduction of skin fibrosis and promotion of new vessel formation. There were no adverse events associated with MSC administration.
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36 37</xref> In addition to the studies in critical limb ischaemia and SSc, the safety and efficacy of allogeneic MSC administration has been established in a variety of conditions, including autoimmune disease. No acute or chronic local tissue reactions to the allogeneic cells have been reported.
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38â€“41</xref> Consequently, there are no safety concerns that would preclude a clinical trial that assesses allogeneic MSCs as a treatment option for refractory digital ulcers in SSc. However, the safety and feasibility of intramuscularly injected MSCs in SSc should be confirmed before initiation of a larger trial that is sufficiently powered to assess efficacy is possible. Therefore, the next logical step in the development of a treatment option for SSc is to assess the safety, feasibility and possible efficacy of intramuscular administration of allogeneic MSCs in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind fashion.
