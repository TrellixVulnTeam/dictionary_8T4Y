<p>Mesenchymal stem—or stromal—cells (MSCs) may be an effective treatment for digital ulcers caused by SSc, as MSCs have potent vasculoregenerative and immunomodulatory properties. MSCs are a subpopulation of bone marrow cells that can differentiate into various mesenchymal cell types (chondrocytes, osteocytes, adipocytes) under specific in vitro conditions.
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that intramuscular administration of MSCs improves wound healing through promotion of angiogenesis and modulation of the locoregional immune response. Studies in mice demonstrated that intramuscular injected MSCs improve neovascularisation after ablation of the femoral artery (hind limb ischaemia model).
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> MSCs were shown in vivo to secrete vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor and other cytokines, growth factors and chemokines in the murine hind limb ischaemia model, showing that MSCs are capable of paracrine interaction with a wide range of cells: immune cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and so on.
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> Further in vitro studies have identified direct cell-to-cell interactions between MSCs, local tissue cells and various immune cells which potentiate the action of MSC-secreted factors.
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20–25</xref> In vivo administration of MSCs leads to increased recruitment of macrophages and endothelial cells, and a reduction of effector T cells, suggesting possible mechanisms of action for the angiogenic and regenerative properties of MSCs.
