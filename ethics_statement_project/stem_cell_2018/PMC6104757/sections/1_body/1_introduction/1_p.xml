<p>Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare multisystem autoimmune connective tissue disease with high morbidity and mortality. The exact aetiology and pathogenesis of SSc are unknown, but involve small-vessel vasculopathy, immune dysregulation with production of autoantibodies and progressive fibrosis of the skin and major internal organs. This contributes to a 10-year mortality ofÂ ~30%.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Microvascular vasculopathy occurs early in the pathogenesis of SSc.
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Such vasculopathy can be found in many organs, contributes to end-organ damage and may give rise to severe complications. Skin vasculopathy results in chronic tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia, and ultimately ischaemic manifestations such as digital ulcers.
