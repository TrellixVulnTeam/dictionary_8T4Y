We analysed the biomechanical, macrostructural efficacy endpoints and immunological and haematological parameter changes from baseline (day 0) by applying a mixed model for repeated measures. We analysed changes in the micro‐structural level from baseline until week 12 based on biopsy data using an ANCOVA model. The statistical tests were two‐tailed, and we adopted a statistical significance level of
