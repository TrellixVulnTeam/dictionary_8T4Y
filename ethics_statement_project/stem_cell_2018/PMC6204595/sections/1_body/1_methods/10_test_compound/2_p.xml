<p>PLX‐PAD is an allogeneic 
 <italic>ex‐vivo</italic> placental expanded adherent stromal cell product. The mesenchymal‐like stromal cells, termed adherent stromal cells have been derived from the full term human placenta following a caesarean section and expanded using plastic adherence on tissue culture dishes followed by three‐dimensional growth on carriers in a bioreactor. Seeding the cells on fibra‐cel disks and placing them in the bioreactor provide a three‐dimensional‐structure microenvironment that enables controlled large‐scale growth of these cells. PLX‐PAD cells obtained from Pluristem Ltd. are stable adhesive cells that can be expanded 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> without the loss of phenotype and without showing signs of karyotypic changes. PLX‐PAD are spindle in shape with a flat, polygonal morphology, and 15–19 μm in diameter.
