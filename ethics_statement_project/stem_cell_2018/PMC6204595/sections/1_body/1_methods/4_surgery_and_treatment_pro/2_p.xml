<p>Patients underwent THA under general anaesthesia via a standard lateral transgluteal approach by one surgeon (C.P.). A longitudinal skin incision was made lateral to the greater trochanter and the subcutaneous tissue dissected. A biopsy of the GM muscle was taken with a needle biopsy device (C.R. BARD Biopsie‐System Magnum Core HS, Siemens, Erlangen Germany) 5 cm proximal to the greater trochanter. The iliotibial tract was opened, and the GM muscle, the greater trochanter, and the proximal vastus lateralis muscle exposed. Then, a transgluteal approach was performed with a dissection of the periosteal flap connecting the GM and the vastus lateralis muscle followed by sharp dissection of the anterior third of the GM muscle for a distance of 5 cm proximal to the tip of the greater trochanter. The gluteus‐vastus flap was then shifted anteriorly and the hip joint exposed in this fashion. Following resection of the joint capsule and the femoral head the acetabulum was reamed and a non‐cemented press‐fit cup was implanted. The proximal femur was then exposed by transferring the leg to external rotation and adduction and a non‐cemented femoral stem implanted after a further reaming procedure. The femoral head was set in place and the hip reduced. A redon drainage was set in place intra‐articularly. The traumatized muscle fibres of the GM muscle were sutured with resorbable material (Vicryl, Ethicon, Somerville, USA) in a single node technique. Following this, the investigational product was thawed and administered into the muscle in 10 injections of 1.5 mL around the cut, in the distance of 1 cm from the cut prior to wound closure. With the used volume and the separation in 10 single injections, we were in every case able to yield depots in the muscle without reflux of the treatment fluid.</p>
