<p>Isometric hip abductor strength of each limb was assessed using a dynamometer operating at 1000 Hz (Biodex System 3, Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY), on which MVICs were performed to determine the maximal voluntary torque. Prior to measurements, patients were warmed up by walking for at least 15 min. The test procedure was explained in detail to each patient, with special attention paid to the positioning and execution of the contraction by an experienced physiotherapist. A custom‐made support was used to support the non‐tested limb during each test, to maintain a proper position with the body upright. All patients were tested in a standing position facing the dynamometer with the legs shoulder width apart, with the hip rotation axis aligned with the dynamometer axis. For familiarization purposes, patients performed a submaximal contraction prior to data collection. Each subject performed an MVIC for 15 s with at least 60 s rest between each MVIC.</p>
