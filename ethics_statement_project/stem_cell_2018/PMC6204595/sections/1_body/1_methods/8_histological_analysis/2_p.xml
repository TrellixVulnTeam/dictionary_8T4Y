<p>All muscle samples were snap frozen, embedded in Tissue‐Tek® O.C.T.TM compound and cut into 10 μm cross sections (Microm HM 60, MICROM International, Walldorf, Germany). The frozen sections were thawed and stained haematoxylin and eosin (Merck, Germany) or immunohistochemistry was performed. Briefly, for the immunohistochemistry, sections were 30 min air‐dried, fixed, and washed in PBS. Before the primary antibodies were used, all sections were incubated with blocking solution (horse or goat serum Biozol, Eching, Germany) for 30 min. IHC (immunohistochemistry) stains were performed with biotinylated antibodies against fast myosin heavy chain (fast‐MHC, clone My 32, #M4276, Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), Factor VIII (#CP 039B, Biocare Medical, Concorde, USA), αβ‐t‐cell‐receptor (#SM1230PS, Acris Antibodies GmbH, Herford, Germany), and CD68 (#SM1718T, Acris Antibodies GmbH, Herford, Germany). After a 60 min incubation with the primary antibody at room temperature, sections were washed twice with PBS for 5 min. Afterwards, the secondary antibody was applied (anti‐mouse or anti‐rabbit, VectorLaboratories Inc, Burlingame, USA) for 60 min, and the sections were washed again. Finally, the avidin‐biotin‐complex (# AK 5000, Alkaline Phosphatase Standard Kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, USA) and Vector®Red Substrat Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, USA) for signal amplification were applied and nuclei were counterstained according to the Mayers Hemalum method.</p>
