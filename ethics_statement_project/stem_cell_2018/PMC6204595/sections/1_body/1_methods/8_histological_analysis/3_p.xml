<p>All images were investigated with a light microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany) equipped with a digital camera (AxioCam MRc, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Germany) in a hundredfold magnification. Subsequently sections were inverted to an entire image using the Axiovision software (Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). For the quantification of the histomorphometric parameters, two blinded investigators analysed the samples manually by using regions of interests (ROIs) generated randomly or the total sections as described below using the software ImageJ (Maryland, USA). For the calculation of the mean myofiber diameter, the shortest diameter of 400 fibres in ROIs on H&amp;E sections were measured and the mean calculated for each patient. Regenerating myofibers were counted on total H&amp;E sections identifying centrally nucleated fibres and given as the number of regenerating fibres per mm
 <sup>2</sup> of muscle tissue. Type II and type I myofibers were counted on total sections stained for fast‐MHC and the percentage of type II of total fibres calculated. Blood vessels were counted in 10 random ROIs of 500 × 500 pixels and given as all FVIII positive vessels per ROI. T‐lymphocytes were counted on total sections as αβ‐t‐cell‐receptor positive cells and given as cells per mm
 <sup>2</sup> of muscle tissue. Lymphocyte numbers in clusters were calculated via the ratio of area of the cluster divided by the mean diameter of a lymphocyte nucleus, previously determined by measuring 50 random nuclei on the sections as 10.2 μm. Macrophages were counted as CD68 positive cells on total sections and given as cells per mm
 <sup>2</sup> of muscle tissue.
