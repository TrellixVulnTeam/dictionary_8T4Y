On the basis of regions of interests in the subcutaneous fatty tissue and the ipsilateral iliac muscle the mean intensity of grey levels were defined defining fat or muscle tissue. The percentage of fatty infiltration in the gluteus muscle was calculated by using the ratio of pixels of fat‐value‐and muscle‐value‐pixels in the determined slices.
