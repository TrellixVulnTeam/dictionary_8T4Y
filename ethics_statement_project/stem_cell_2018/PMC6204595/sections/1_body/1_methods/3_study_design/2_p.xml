<p>The study was a mono‐centric, randomized, double blind, and placebo‐controlled phase I/IIa trial. Study site was a large academic center. We compared two dosing arms with one placebo arm (1:1:1). Randomization was based on a computerized algorithm randomizing the patients into three blocks of six patients generated by the data management of the study (CSG—Clinische Studien Gesellschaft mbH, Friedrichstraße 180, 10117 Berlin). The investigational product was shipped to the center after successful screening and randomization of a patient and thawed immediately before use. The inclusion criteria included a scheduled hip arthroplasty due to degenerative arthritis of the hip, an age of 50–75 years at the time of screening, an American Society of Anesthesiologists score of ≤3 and the ability to provide informed consent. For exclusion criteria, we refer the interested reader to the supplement.</p>
