<p>Procedural pain and soft tissue swelling are typical post‐operative side effects of hip arthroplasty. Analysing their distribution in 
 <italic>Table</italic> S4, it can be seen that in the 150 M group, five patients showed procedural pain in comparison to 3 in the placebo and the high dose 300 M group. We cannot exclude pain as a symptom of the early immunological effect in the 150 M group, but considering that only two more patients stated pain in the 150 M group compared with the other groups and that the 300 M group was identical to placebo, we would refrain from an interpretation in this direction. Procedural swelling could be seen in only one more patient in the PLX‐PAD groups compared with placebo, which does not allow an interpretation, in our opinion.
