<p>This study comprises data related to the first successful use of an allogeneic cell therapeutic approach in patients with skeletal muscle injury. We followed up patients for 2 years after treatment, and we did not observe any serious product‐related side effects. The primary finding of our study was an improvement in muscle strength mirrored by an increase in muscle volume in the cell‐therapy groups compared with the placebo group and an inferiority of the high‐dose group vs. the low‐dose group. Most striking was the concordance of the results gathered from the functional assessments and micro‐morphological and macro‐morphological studies with the immunological analyses.</p>
