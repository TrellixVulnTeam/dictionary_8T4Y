 <xref rid="jcsm12316-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref> our data reveal that the effect of transplanted PLX‐PAD cells is not based on differentiation but rather on trophic and immunomodulatory support of the endogenous regeneration. This finding is consistent with recent studies on tendon healing demonstrating the decisive role of early trophic factor delivery to the site of injury.
