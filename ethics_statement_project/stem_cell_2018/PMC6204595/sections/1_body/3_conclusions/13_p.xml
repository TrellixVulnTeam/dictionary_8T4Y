<p>As mentioned before we think that our immunological data may provide an explanation to why low‐dose outperformed high‐dose cell therapy. The central point seems to be the unspecific bystander activation of effector T cells that can migrate easily to inflamed tissue and induce an overwhelming local inflammation, which is not supportive of regeneration. Unfortunately, we were not allowed to take early biopsies, which could confirm our hypothesis derived from our immunological data. The week 12 biopsies did not reveal any differences in immune cell infiltration, which only shows that the immunological activation is resolved by endogenous regulation (e.g. IL‐10) which is also reflected by the recovery of the temporary drop in muscle power increase in the high‐dose group at week 12.</p>
