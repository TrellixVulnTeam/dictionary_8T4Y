<p>Our data suggest that the beneficial effects of regeneration‐supporting cells are partially compromised beyond an upper dose threshold. In our preclinical studies using autologous MSCs, we observed a plateau effect in the dose–response relationship, which also indicates that a larger number of cells does not necessarily imply a better functional outcome.
