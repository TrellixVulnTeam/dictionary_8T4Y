<p>In an injury, which does not comprise the whole muscle, such as the direct lateral approach used as a model in this study, the prize for the high standardization level is the compensation of contraction force within 6 weeks (first time of measurement). Patients of the placebo stayed at this functional level despite the new hip joint and an intensive rehabilitation program, which would naturally lead to an increase in force in the trained musculature. Patients treated with 150 million PLX‐PAD showed an increase of contraction force and volumes of GM muscles compared with the placebo group. This increase can either be related to an improved healing of the injured muscle part (which in our opinion is the most probable based on previous work with MSCs in preclinical models), or by a hypertrophy or even hyperplasia of the non‐injured muscle. Due to the restrictions of the human model, a more exact differentiation was unfortunately not possible. Since we naturally could not analyse the whole muscle tissue of the patients and had to rely on fine needle biopsies of one circumscribed region of the treated muscle, the data from this analysis has to be interpreted cautiously. We did not observe an accumulation of immune cells in the treatment groups different from the placebo group and therefore did not find evidence for a compartment shift of the cells. Since we were analysing a region that has been treated and was located directly proximal to the injury zone, we would have expected to observe an immune cell infiltration related to the treatment in this area, but, of course, an infiltration in another muscle region cannot be excluded. Likewise, we cannot exclude that another region of the GM muscle or even another periarticular muscle would show changes in vessel formation and muscle fibre type changes after treatment, but we did not observe this in the biopsies.</p>
