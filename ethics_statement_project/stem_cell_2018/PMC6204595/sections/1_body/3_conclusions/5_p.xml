<p>Another observation was that low‐dose PLX‐PAD but fewer high‐dose PLX‐PAD almost completely abolished the surgery‐associated, stress‐related early changes in immune cell composition and IL‐10 release. The acute stress response immediately after surgery or trauma frequently results in intestinal endotoxin translocation leading to inflammation and protein catabolism that predominantly affects skeletal muscles and results in weight loss and muscle wasting.
 <xref rid="jcsm12316-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref> The reduction of initial protein catabolism could therefore have contributed to strength and volume advantages after the low‐dose treatment over time. Paralleling the initial changes in functional parameters in the high‐dose group, we observed a partial suppression of the initial stress response followed by an unspecific inflammatory reaction after the first post‐operative week. The latter may be reflected in the delayed decrease in muscle strength in this high‐dose group.
