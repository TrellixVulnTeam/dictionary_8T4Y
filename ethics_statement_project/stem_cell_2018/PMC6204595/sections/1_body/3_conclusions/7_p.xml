<p>Another observation was the increase in muscle contraction force after low‐dose treatment on the contralateral, non‐treated side. It remains unknown, if this effect was mediated by the secretory effects of PLX‐PAD cells or an improvement in neurophysiological control due to the better performance of the treated side, or a combination of both. The latter mechanism would be supported by the fact that the GM volume did not change on the non‐treated side and that cross‐educational effects are known to improve contralateral limb strength of the trained side by approximately 50% after unilateral training.
 <xref rid="jcsm12316-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref> The effect on the contralateral side is not as pronounced as on the treated side, voting for an additional local effect of the cells.
