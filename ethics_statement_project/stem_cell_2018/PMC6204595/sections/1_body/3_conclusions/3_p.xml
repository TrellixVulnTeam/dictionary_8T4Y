<p>Research of the recent past developed the concept of the immune system as a central player in regenerative processes, triggered by tissue damage. In the regeneration of skeletal muscle macrophages and T‚Äêcells coordinate proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts accompanied by a close interplay between local and systemic elements of the immune system.

However, the biopsies were taken relatively late where immunological differences might be hardly detectable.
