<p>Preclinical work by us and other groups has demonstrated that the local injection of autologous mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) improves contraction strength after skeletal muscle injury.

 <xref rid="jcsm12316-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> Successful regeneration results from an orchestrated interplay among stem/progenitor mobilization/activation and distinct cell‐matrix interactions controlled by inflammatory processes. Therefore, the immunomodulatory effects of MSC‐like cells and their secretion of trophic factors are key to tissue regeneration.
