<p>PLacental‐eXpanded mesenchymal‐like adherent cells (PLX‐PAD) exhibit a similar marker profile and proliferation properties as MSCs derived from other sources

Data from two phase I first‐in‐man studies in patients suffering from chronic limb ischemia demonstrated their low alloimmunogenicity, which enabled their use as a Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA)‐unmatched off‐the‐shelf product.
