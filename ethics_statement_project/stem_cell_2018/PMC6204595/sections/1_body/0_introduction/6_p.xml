<p>Here, we translated our preclinical work into patient treatment using a highly standardized and frequent muscle injury. We treated damage of the gluteus medius (GM) muscle due to a direct lateral, transgluteal implantation of a total hip using a local, intramuscular injection of PLX‚ÄêPAD. Patients were followed up for safety, efficacy, biomechanical muscle function, muscle morphology, and the impact of the therapy on the immune system.</p>
