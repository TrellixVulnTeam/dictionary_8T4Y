<p>Skeletal muscles are of utmost importance for movement, and they also play a critical role in joint stabilization and trophic support for underlying structures. Impaired muscle functioning results in reduced strength, a reduced range of motion and joint instability, effects that are all associated with decreased quality of life, enhanced mortality, and socio‚Äêeconomic burden. Even so, there are no therapeutic options for regenerating injured skeletal muscles.</p>
