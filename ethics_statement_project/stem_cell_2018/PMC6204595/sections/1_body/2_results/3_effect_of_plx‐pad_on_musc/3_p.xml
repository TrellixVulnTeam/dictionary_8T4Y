<p>The placebo group exhibited a slight increase in muscle force and volume on both sides over 6 months. In the high‐dose treatment group, we observed an initial superior (treated side) or equivalent (contralateral side) muscle force compared with the low‐dose and placebo group at 6 weeks, but with a decline at week 12 (

 <sup>th</sup> week; this group did not reach statistical significance compared with the placebo group (
