<p>Remarkably, alterations of immune cell subsets displaying the immediate post‐operative stress were significantly reduced by PLX‐PAD therapy, specifically in the low‐dose group. This effect could be observed as a reduced relative increase in the number of CD16+ natural killer cells, activated CD19+ B‐cells, CD57+8+ TEMRA cells, and early IL‐10. We also observed a reduced drop in the frequency of naive CD4+ T‐cells and T‐regulatory cell subset and reduced alterations in myeloid DC2 (CD11C+BDCA3‐) cells (

Interestingly, two out of the six high‐dose patients exhibited a significant increase in their TNF plasma levels within the first post‐operative day.
