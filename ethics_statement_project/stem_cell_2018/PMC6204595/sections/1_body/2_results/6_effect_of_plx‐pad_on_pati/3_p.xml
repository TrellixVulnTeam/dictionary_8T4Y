 <xref rid="jcsm12316-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref> shows adverse events as classified by Medra System Organ Class (SOC) with all sub categories. All PLX‐PAD treated patients and 57% of placebo treated patients had at least one of the adverse related events classified in the SOC of injury, poisoning, or procedural complications. The adverse events belonging to this SOC that were observed in PLX‐PAD treated patients in the clinical trial were by frequency order procedural pain, post‐procedural swelling, procedural hypotension, and suture‐related complications. In the placebo group, the AEs that were reported in the highest percent of patients were procedural pain and post‐operative anaemia, whereas in the PLX‐PAD groups the AEs that were reported in the highest percent of patients were procedural pain and post‐procedural swelling. Muscle spasms/tightness occurred in a total of four patients treated with PLX‐PAD. All these AEs were typical in the post‐operative follow‐up of hip arthroplasty and were categorized as not related to treatment with the PLX‐PAD cells.
