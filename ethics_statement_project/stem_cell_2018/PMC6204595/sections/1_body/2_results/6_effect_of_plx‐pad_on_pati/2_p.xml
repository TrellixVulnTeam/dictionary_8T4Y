<p>We did not find any safety concerns over the 2 year observation period. At week 1 after treatment, both therapy groups exhibited a transient elevation of transaminases (maximum elevations: AST, 150 M: 49.3 ± 17.7 U/l (&lt;50); ALT, 300 M: 53.7 ± 24.3 U/l (&lt;41)), which were not detectable after 6 weeks. Treatment‐emergent adverse events are summarized in
