<p id="Par13">Complete medical history, medication history, and list of concomitant medications were collected from all subjects prior to any treatment. Subjects also underwent a complete physical examination, vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure), a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and laboratory testing (complete blood count, serum chemistry) at baseline. MS diagnosis was confirmed according to the revised McDonald criteria. Enrolled subjects received 140 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> UCMSC intravenously over the course of seven visits (20 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> UCMSC/day) separated by 1–4 days. At each treatment visit, subjects were assessed for any adverse events experienced since their last visit, received a physical examination (vital signs pre- and post- infusion), and were reviewed for adverse events throughout the visit.
