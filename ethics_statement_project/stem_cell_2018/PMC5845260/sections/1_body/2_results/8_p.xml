<p id="Par26">At baseline, average time for the 25FWT Trial 1 was 17.43 s and 17.51 s for Trial 2 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Overall mean time was 17.47 s, and average minimum time was 15.85 s. One month after treatment, average walk time for Trial 2 improved by 6.01 s, but average time for Trial 1 took longer than baseline, as did overall mean time, and average minimum time. At 1 year, all walk times were reduced when compared to baseline. Since not all subjects completed both trials of the 25FWT at a given time point, and not all subjects completed all follow-ups, statistical comparisons between baseline and follow-up scores could not include all subjects. Twelve subjects completed Trial 2 of the 25FWT at the three follow-up time points (baseline, 1 month and 1 year), with a statistically significant reduction (p &lt; 0.02) in walk times found between baseline and 1 month (Fig.
