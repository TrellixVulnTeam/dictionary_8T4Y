<p id="Par23">SNRS scores were recorded at baseline and 1 month post-treatment for all subjects; scores at 1 year were recorded for 17 of 20 subjects (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The SNRS total mean score rose slightly from 75.0 (SD = 11.9) at baseline to 75.5 (SD = 16.5) at 1 month post-treatment, and decreased to 73.5 (SD = 19.5, N = 17) 1 year post-treatment. A statistically significant improvement (p &lt; 0.01) was seen for the bladder/bowel/sex dysfunction category at 1 month from the baseline assessment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). A statistically significant worsening was seen in the study group in four categories compared to baseline: visual acuity at 1 month (p &lt; 0.02) and 1 year (p &lt; 0.03), right upper extremity motor function at 1 year (p &lt; 0.02), right lower extremity sensory function at 1 month (p &lt; 0.03) and 1 year (p &lt; 0.01), and left lower extremity sensory function at 1 month (p &lt; 0.01).
