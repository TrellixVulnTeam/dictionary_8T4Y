Fifteen subjects (75%) had a diagnosis of relapsing–remitting MS, four (20%) with primary progressive MS, and one (5%) with secondary progressive MS. Eleven subjects (55%) required ambulation assistance (wheelchair, walker, or cane) at baseline. Five subjects (25%) did not take any MS-specific medication over the course of the study, 10 (50%) continued taking their usual MS medications, one (5%) began using MS-specific medication during follow-up, and four (20%) reduced their intake of MS-specific medication during follow-up.
