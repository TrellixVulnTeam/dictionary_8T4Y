 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). At baseline, EDSS scores ranged from 2.5–7.0, with a mean score of 5.23 (SD = 1.50). At 1 month, the mean score decreased to 4.75 (SD = 2.00), a mean reduction of 0.48 (SD = 0.85) or about one category. Scores reduced further at the 1-year time point, to 4.62 (SD = 2.72), a mean reduction of 0.68 (SD = 1.49), a little more than one category. Differences were statistically significant at 1 month (p &lt; 0.03), and 1 year (p &lt; 0.04) when compared to baseline.
