<p id="Par24">The 9HPT was recorded for all subjects at baseline and 1 month post-treatment; scores were available for 19 of 20 subjects at 1 year (one lost to follow-up). Overall, subjects saw improvements in their scores. Statistically significant improvements from baseline were seen in non-dominant hand scores for both best (p &lt; 0.01) and average (p &lt; 0.02) times at the 1-month assessment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The best score for the non-dominant hand was 37.56 s at baseline, 32.49 at 1 month (5.1 s improvement), and 31.55 at 1 year (6.0 s improvement). The average mean score for the non-dominant hand was 40.80 s at baseline, 35.01 at 1 month (a 5.8 s improvement), and 34.09 (a 6.7 s improvement).
