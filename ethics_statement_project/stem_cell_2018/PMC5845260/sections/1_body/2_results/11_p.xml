<p id="Par29">Statistically significant changes from baseline occurred at both 1-month and 1-year assessments for the RAND SF-36 role limitations-physical (p &lt; 0.002 and p &lt; 0.03, respectively) and health change (p &lt; 0.004 and p &lt; 0.02, respectively) categories. A statistically significant change occurred from baseline at 1 month in the energy category (p &lt; 0.006) and the average score (p &lt; 0.001). Bonferroni corrections retained statistically significant differences at 1 month in these four categories (p &lt; 0.02). Most categories in the RAND SF-36 showed improvement over the baseline at 1 month and 1-year evaluations, with the exception of the 1-month physical function score. Most categories scored highest at the 1-month evaluation with the exception of the physical function category (Fig.
