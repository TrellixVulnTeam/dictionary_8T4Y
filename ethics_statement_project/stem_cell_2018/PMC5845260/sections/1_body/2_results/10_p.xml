<p id="Par28">Scores for the RAND SF-36 test were recorded for all subjects at baseline and 1 month, and for 17 of 20 subjects at 1 year post-treatment. Overall, subjects reported improvements in their health during the study. Total QOL scores increased over baseline for 15 subjects at the 1 month follow up visit, while only five decreased. At 1 year, total QOL score improved over baseline for 11 subjects, while six decreased (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). At 1 month and 1 year, more than half of the subjects reported their condition as better or the same on all scale scores (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). At 1 month, more than 50% of subjects reported improvements on five of the eight scale scores (role limitations-physical, energy/fatigue, emotional well-being, social functioning, and general health), as well as health change; 45% (9/20) of subjects reported improvements in the pain scale, and 35% (7/20) of subjects reported improvements in their physical functioning and role limitations-emotional. At 1 year, more than half of subjects reported feeling better in five of the eight scales (physical functioning, role limitations-physical, energy/fatigue, emotional wellbeing, and general health), as well as health change; 47% (8/17) reported improvements in their social functioning, 35% (6/17) in pain scale, and 29% (5/17) in role limitations-emotional.
