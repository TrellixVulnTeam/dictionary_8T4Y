<p id="Par27">Some subjects changed ambulatory status at the time of the 25FWT at the 1-month visit: two subjects reduced their dependence upon assistive devices (one from wheelchair to walker, one from walker to cane); one became more dependent (from no assistance to a cane). At the 1-year visit, two subjects reduced their dependence upon assistance devices from baseline to 1-year visit (one from wheelchair to walker, one from walker to cane to no assistance); two increased dependency (one from unilateral cane to walker, one from no assistance to cane). One of the subjects, wheelchair-bound at baseline and thus unable to complete the test then, was able to complete it at the 1-month and 1-year follow-ups.</p>
