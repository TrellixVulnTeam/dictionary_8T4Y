<p id="Par30">Pre- and post-treatment MRIs from the brain and the cervical spinal cord were reviewed qualitatively for every subject. MRI was unavailable at the 1-year follow-up for two subjects. Not all subjects had the second MRI taken at exactly 1 year after treatment; there was some variation in completion of the second MRI, up to 4 months after the 1-year mark. No common themes were detected regarding number of lesions or disappearance of lesions. Of the 18 subjects that did complete MRI both at baseline and at the 1-year follow-up, 15 (83.3%) showed no disease progression or no new or active lesions. Two subjects (11.1%) showed progression in their lesions. One patient (5.6%) showed near complete resolution of the plaques in the brain, in previously noted areas of abnormal signal intensity consistent with demyelinating disease (Fig.
