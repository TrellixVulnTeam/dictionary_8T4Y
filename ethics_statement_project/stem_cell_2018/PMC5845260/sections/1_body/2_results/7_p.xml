<p id="Par25">For the 25FWT, subjects were categorized into one of four categories, based on their need for assistance to complete the test (in order of increasing need): no assistance; cane; walker, and wheelchair. While scoring guidance for the 25FWT directs to use the average of the two completed trials, the minimum time was also analyzed to enable inclusion of any/all subject(s) who completed at least one full trial. At baseline, all 20 subjects were available for the 25FWT, and 19 subjects were available at 1 month (one did not take the test). At 1 year, results were recorded for 17 subjects (two did not take the test; and one was lost to follow up). Some subjects were unable to complete one or both trials due to ambulation status (two were wheelchair-bound at baseline, one at the 1-month and at 1-year follow-ups), or fatigue (one subject was fatigued at the 1-year follow-up).</p>
