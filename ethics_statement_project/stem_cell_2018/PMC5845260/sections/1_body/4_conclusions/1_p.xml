<p id="Par39">We have shown that the intravenous infusion of UCMSC over several days is safe in subjects with MS. Additionally, UCMSC infusions may hold benefits, since this small study group saw improvement in bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction, walking, upper extremity physical function, energy and fatigue, general perspective of a positive health change and improved quality of life, and MRI lesions. More clinical studies, particularly with a larger cohort, are needed to substantiate the specific benefits of UCMSC infusion as a potential MS therapy.</p>
