<p id="Par32">No Serious Adverse Events occurred in the study. One single Adverse Event (AE), headache, was noted as probably related to treatment. Of the AEs denoted as possibly related to treatment, most were headache or fatigue. Headache is a known complaint noted to occur during or just after MSC infusions, most of which quickly resolve [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Additionally, Foley et al demonstrated that patients with MS commonly experience headache [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Thus, headache is not unexpected at the time of or just after UCMSC infusions. Similarly, fatigue is one of the most common complaints [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Fatigue appears in all ages and phenotypes of MS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and is a primary determinant of poor QOL [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], affecting both physical and mental components independent of disability level [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Thus, although fatigue is a possibly related AE in this study, it is also a very common disability symptom of MS.
