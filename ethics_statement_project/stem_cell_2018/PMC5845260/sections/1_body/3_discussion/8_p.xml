<p id="Par38">The small sample size is the most significant limitation of this study in that it may impact the statistical significance of the results. When subjects were lost to follow-up, the sample size was reduced; due to the nature of certain tests used to measure efficacy signals, failing to complete one part of the test often invalidated obtaining an average for the score. While this issue could have been avoided with larger recruitment numbers, we are still in the lower threshold of the 20â€“80 subjects recommended by FDA for early trials. Additionally, subjects with certain forms of MS may be less likely to develop new lesions, which may impact the findings of the reported MRI results. As this was primarily a safety and proof of concept trial, we did not require subjects to stop their usual medications, which could have a confounding impact on our findings. Poor medication adherence is frequently seen among patients with MS (usually because of cost, perceived lack of efficacy, or adverse effects) [

However, it is noteworthy that a further 20% felt well enough to reduce their intake. In any case, efficacy of UCMSC therapy for MS should be confirmed with larger, controlled, randomized trials.
