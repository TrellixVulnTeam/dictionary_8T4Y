<p id="Par34">Previous studies using MSC treatment for MS have reported improvements in EDSS scores [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In our case, the statistically significant (p &lt; 0.03) change in EDSS mean scores from baseline to 1 month reflects a change in disability category, which could translate into an improved ability to walk and work a full day with minimal, if any, assistance. Although other categories showed worsening typical of disease progression, the bladder/bowel/sexual dysfunction category of the SNRS showed statistically significant improvement at 1 month (p &lt; 0.05). This finding may be encouraging in that up to 60% of patients with MS report sexual dysfunction problems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] while over 50% experience bowel dysfunction and up to 75% will report bladder dysfunction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].
