<p id="Par8">The safety of MSC therapy for MS has been demonstrated in several trials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We reported three subjects treated with MSC and stromal vascular fraction with no adverse effects; all showed clinical improvements in cognitive and motor function and presented no new lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. More recently, trials with placenta-derived MSC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], or with intravenous UCMSC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] reported few mild or moderate adverse effects, as well as some improvement in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores.
