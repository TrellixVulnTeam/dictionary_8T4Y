<p id="Par18">At the end of treatment in the main PIX301 study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], significantly more patients who received pixantrone achieved a CR/CRu (20.0 vs 5.7%; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.021) and an ORR (37.1 vs 14.3%; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003) than did those who received a comparator drug. Median PFS was also significantly prolonged in the pixantrone treatment group [5.3 vs 2.6 months; hazard ratio (HR) 0.60; 95% CI 0.42, 0.86; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.005]. A post-hoc analysis of data from a subgroup of patients in the study with histologically confirmed relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell NHL also demonstrated a significantly improved CR/CRu (23.1 vs 5.1%; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.047) and ORR (43.6 vs 12.8%; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) with third- or fourth-line pixantrone treatment compared with comparator agents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Clinical response was especially improved among those patients who had received previous rituximab treatment, with an improved CR (30.0 vs 5.6%; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.093), ORR (45.0 vs 11.1%; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.033), and median PFS (5.4 vs 2.8 months; HR 0.52; 95% CI 0.26, 1.04) with pixantrone versus comparator agents.
