<p id="Par23">Patients with long-term responses clearly have a tumor that is chemosensitive to pixantrone. Intercalation of pixantrone into DNA results in successive rounds of aberrant mitosis, ultimately leading to cell death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In contrast to anthracyclines, pixantrone is only a weak inhibitor of topoisomerase II, and while it directly alkylates DNA, forming stable DNA adducts and cross-strand breaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], the main way pixantrone causes cell death is to impair the fidelity of mitosis without triggering the DNA damage response or mitotic checkpoint activation. While it is clear that pixantrone has a mechanism of action that is unique from anthracyclines, the specific mechanisms involved in the long-term responses seen among patients receiving pixantrone in PIX301 are unknown.
