<p id="Par19">The results of the present analysis build on previous results and suggest that it is possible to obtain a long-lasting response with pixantrone. Also, the potential for a durable response to pixantrone appears to be independent of whether the best response to prior therapy was a CR, PR, stable disease, or progressive disease. Of note, our results indicate that it is possible to get a response with later lines of NHL treatment, even with monotherapy, which is important because monotherapy is typically associated with lower rates of toxicities than multi-agent regimens.</p>
