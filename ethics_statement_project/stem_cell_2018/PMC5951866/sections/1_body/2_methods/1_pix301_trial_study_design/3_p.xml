The choice of comparator was left to the treating physician, but suitable choices included vinorelbine, oxaliplatin, ifosfamide, etoposide, mitoxantrone, gemcitabine or rituximab administered at prespecified standard doses and schedules. Randomization was achieved by an interactive voice response system and was stratified by region (USA vs Western Europe vs the rest of the world), International Prognostic Index score (0 or 1 vs ≥ 2), and previous autologous stem-cell transplant (SCT) [yes vs no] [
