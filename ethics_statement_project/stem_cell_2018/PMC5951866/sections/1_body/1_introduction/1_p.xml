<p id="Par6">Current management of relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) remains an unmet medical need, due to a poor prognostic outlook and lack of treatment options [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. First-line therapy for aggressive B-cell NHL is an anthracycline-based regimen in combination with rituximab, such as R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Complete response rates with R-CHOP of around 80% have been reported, with a 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) of approximately 50% [
