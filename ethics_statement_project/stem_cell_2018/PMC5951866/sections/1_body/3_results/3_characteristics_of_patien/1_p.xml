<p id="Par17">Four patients survived without progression for more than 400 days (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These patients had a duration of response to pixantrone of 679, 633, 623 and 448 days; respective ages were 75, 60, 63 and 58 years; respective histologies were DLBCL, DLBCL, transformed indolent lymphoma and transformed indolent lymphoma; and respective numbers of prior lines of therapy were two, two, two and three. The patient with the longest response duration to pixantrone was the only one of the four patients to have received prior rituximab treatment. Response to prior chemotherapy did not appear to affect the long-term response to pixantrone. Respective last therapies (response; duration of treatment) prior to pixantrone were R-CHOP (CR; 67 days); DHAP (cytarabine, dexamethasone, cisplatin) [PD; 43 days]; ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) [PD; 43 days]; and ESHAP (etoposide, methylprednisolone, cytarabine, cisplatin) [PR; 96 days].
