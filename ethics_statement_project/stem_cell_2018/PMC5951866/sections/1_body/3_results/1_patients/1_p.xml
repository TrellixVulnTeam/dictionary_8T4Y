<p id="Par15">Overall, 17 patients treated with pixantrone in the intention-to-treat population achieved a CR/CRu in the PIX301 trial (i.e. 24% of the pixantrone treatment arm). Demographics and clinical characteristics of these patients are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The median age of these patients was 61 (range 41–75) years, and there were slightly more male than female patients (10 vs 7 patients). The most common diagnoses were DLBCL (10 patients) and transformed indolent lymphoma (4 patients). Most patients had received two prior lines of therapy (12 patients, 71%). Of note, there was wide variation in the time from diagnosis to study entry (219–4777 days). Two protocol violations were subsequently identified, where two patients had received monotherapy in the treatment line prior to randomization (Table
