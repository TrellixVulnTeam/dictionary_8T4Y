Its conditional approval in Europe was based on results from the open-label, randomized, phase 3 PIX301 study, comparing pixantrone monotherapy with physician's choice of treatment in 140 patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive NHL.<h4>Methods</h4>This post-hoc analysis of the PIX301 study investigated possible correlations between patient characteristics and clinical response in 17 patients (24%) treated with pixantrone who achieved a complete response (CR) or an unconfirmed complete response (CRu) at study end.<h4>Results</h4>These patients (10 male and 7 female) had a median age of 61 (range 41-75)\u00a0years, and the most common diagnoses were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n\u00a0=\u00a010) and transformed indolent lymphoma (n\u00a0=\u00a04).
