<p>COMPASS will be conducted in adult acute-care wards of three Swiss hospitals, one academic medical centre and two regional hospitals. HUG (Geneva University Hospitals) is one of the largest hospitals in Switzerland with about 1900 beds and 340 000 patient-days in acute care per year.
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> HUG has deployed an in-house electronic health record (EHR) since 2000 and a computerised physician order entry system (CPOE) system since 2006.
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> ORL (Regional Hospital of Lugano) and OSG (Regional Hospital of Bellinzona) are the largest hospitals of Southern Switzerland, with respectively 306 and 228 beds, and about 100 000 and 72 000 patients-days per year. Both hospitals have developed and adapted an EHR and CPOE system based on the in-house system of HUG since 2008 and 2014, respectively. All three hospitals have AMS programmes with regularly updated antimicrobial prescribing guidelines, review of all positive blood cultures, regular teaching sessions for physicians, and internal and external benchmarking of antibiotic use and resistance. Dedicated ward rounds in some divisions (eg, the intensive care unit and haematological or solid organ transplant wards), are also part of the AMS programme at HUG; however, these units will not be included into COMPASS. The overall framework for the COMPASS intervention is identical in all study sites; given the particularities of each setting (different EHRs, different categories of hospitals, different language, different prescribing guidelines) some details of the intervention may slightly vary between sites.
