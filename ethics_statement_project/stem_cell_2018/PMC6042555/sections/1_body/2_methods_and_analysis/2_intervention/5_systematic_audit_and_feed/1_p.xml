<p>Quality indicators of antimicrobial prescribing such as concordance with local guidelines (in terms of duration of therapy and drug) will be automatically assessed based on the information collected during the prescribing process. All physicians on a given intervention ward will receive monthly emails outlining the performance of the ward compared with the other participating wards and compared with the guideline recommendation (if applicable). The results will be presented graphically.</p>
