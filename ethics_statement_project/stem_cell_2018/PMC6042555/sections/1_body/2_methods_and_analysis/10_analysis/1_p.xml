<p>Outcome variables will first be summarised across treatment and intervention groups and then explored using descriptive statistics, taking into account the matched design by sandwich variance estimators for CIs. The DOT/admission at the individual level will be compared between the intervention groups using a random-effects Poisson model with two levels, taking into account clustering within hospitals and the matched pairs. The following confounders will be considered: sex, age, type of comorbidities and type of admission (internal medicine vs other), whereby all variables that result in a change of &gt;5% in the coefficient for the intervention effect in bivariate regression will be added to the multivariate model, and the most parsimonious model will be selected through the conditional AIC. Collinearity will be checked through a correlation matrix, whereby the most relevant, clinical variable will be selected in case of R
 <sup>2</sup> &gt;0.8.
