<p>Twenty-four acuteÂ wards fulfilling the inclusion criteria (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>) will be recruited by approaching the heads of the concerned departments (16 wards at HUG, 4 wards at ORL and OSG each). Acute wards will be paired according to centre, specialty (eg, medicine, surgery, geriatrics) and baseline antibiotic use in DOT/admission. Wards will be randomised 1:1 to the intervention or control arm within each pair using an online random sequence generator (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>). The randomisation plan will be established by personnel not directly involved in the study. Depending on the recruitment of wards, specialities may be matched across ORL and OSG since due to the smaller size these hospitals may only have one ward per specialty (eg, visceral surgery, orthopaedics). In that case randomisation may be constrained to make sure that each hospital has at least one intervention ward in either specialty (eg, orthopaedics or visceral surgery).
