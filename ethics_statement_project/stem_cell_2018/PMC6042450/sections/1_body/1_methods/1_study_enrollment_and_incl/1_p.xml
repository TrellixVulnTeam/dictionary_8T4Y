<p id="Par15">These findings are the mid-term results of a prospective, experimental, non-controlled, phase I clinical trial supported by investigator-driven funding. The inclusion criteria included secondary infertility or embryo transfer failure caused by recurrent IUA, a desire to be pregnant, an age of less than 45Â years, and agreeing to participate in the study. Patients were excluded from recruitment if they had any of the following issues: having hysteroscopy contraindications, chromosome karyotype abnormalities, congenital uterine malformations, severe adenomyosis, contraindications to pregnancy, contraindications to estradiol treatment, medical history of pelvic malignant tumors, previous experience with pelvic radiotherapy. For patients who met the indications for stem cell therapy, written informed consent was obtained. Patients with recurrent IUA were diagnosed according to their history profiles, and three experienced gynecologists at the Drum Tower Hospital performed hysteroscopy examinations for severity classification using the American Fertility Society scoring method (The American Fertility Society, 1988) during the screening process.</p>
