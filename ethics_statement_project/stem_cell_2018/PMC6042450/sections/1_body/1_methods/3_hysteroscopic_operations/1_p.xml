<p id="Par17">Two experienced gynecologists using ultrasound guidance performed the hysteroscopic operations. The endometrial adhesions were separated using non-electrified micro scissors until an anatomical uterine cavity with slight staxis was observed. The UC-MSC/collagen scaffold complex was spread onto an 18F Foley catheter and placed into the uterine cavity, and then an infill catheter bulb containing 3 ml of saline was used to attach the scaffold to the inner wall of uterine cavity. After 12 h, the catheter was removed after withdrawing saline in the bulb. The procedure was performed following 10 days of 6 mg/day Progynova (estradiol) (menstrual period day 13). Continuous administration of the same dosage of Progynova, lasting for 30 days following the operation, and 60 mg of progesterone was injected on the 30th day post-operation. Then, the hormone replacement therapy was stopped, and patients returned to a natural menstrual cycle.</p>
