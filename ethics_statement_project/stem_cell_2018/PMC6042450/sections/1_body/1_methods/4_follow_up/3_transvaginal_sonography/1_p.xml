<p id="Par20">Baseline (during the natural menstrual cycle before surgery) and follow-up (3 months after surgery) endometrial thickness and blood flow measurements were taken using a Doppler ultrasound scan to evaluate endometrial regeneration. We also assessed the degradation of the collagen scaffold in the second month following surgery. The image pulse repetition frequency (PRF) was 0.6 kHz when assessing blood flow.</p>
