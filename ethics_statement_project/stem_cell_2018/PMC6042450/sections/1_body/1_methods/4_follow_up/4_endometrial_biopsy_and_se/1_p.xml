<p id="Par21">Hysteroscopic inspections were performed at the late proliferation phase, endometrial biopsies were collected from the adhesion area, and the locations were recorded prior to treatment with UC-MSCs. A second-look hysteroscopic inspection was performed still at the late proliferation phase, 3Â months after UC-MSC transplantation, by the same gynecologist. The IUA score and the anatomy of the uterine cavity were evaluated during this hysteroscopic inspection. At the same time, endometrial biopsies were performed by sampling endometrial tissues at the location of the first biopsies.</p>
