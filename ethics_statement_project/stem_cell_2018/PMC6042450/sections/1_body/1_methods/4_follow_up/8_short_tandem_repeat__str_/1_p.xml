<p id="Par26">Genomic DNA was extracted from the UC-MSCs and endometrial biopsies 3 months after surgery from ten patients. The loci D1S2344, D1S104, D1S2740, D5S681, D5S1977, D7S820, D13S317, D2S1338, and D21S111 were amplified and electrophoresed by genetic analyzer 3730 (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The lengths of the amplicons were compared between the donor and the repaired tissues. The percentage of the donor DNA was calculated based on the areas of the alleles. To provide positive controls, we made two mixed DNAs with two unrelated DNAs, which were selected from our laboratory with highly recognizable STR alleles, with 1:9 and 1:5 as a recipe.</p>
