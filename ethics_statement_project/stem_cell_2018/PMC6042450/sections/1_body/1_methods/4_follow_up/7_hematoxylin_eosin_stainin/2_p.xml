<p id="Par25">Immunohistochemical staining was used to assess the regeneration and neovascularization of the endometrium. Paraffin blocks were cut at a thickness of 2 μm. Serial sections were collected on polylysine-coated glass slides and deparaffinized, and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. After heat-mediated antigen retrieval, the slides were incubated with 10% serum from the species in which the secondary antibody was generated to block nonspecific binding. The tissue sections were labeled with antibodies (ER-α, Epitomic EP1; Ki67, Abcam ab15580, Cambridge, UK; vWF, Abcam ab6994, Cambridge, UK; ΔNp63, Zytomed MSK097–05, Berlin, Germany) overnight at 4 °C. Negative controls were performed by substituting the primary antibodies with the same concentration of pre-immune rabbit or mouse IgG or by omitting the primary antibodies. After incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, the sections were exposed to DAB to visualize the antigen signals. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and viewed under a microscope (DMi8, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Positively stained cells were counted or stain density was measured in all fields for each slide.
