Secondary outcomes included live birth rate, ongoing pregnancy rate (&gt; 12 weeks active fetus), miscarriage rate, menstrual volume and histological changes in the endometrium. The IUA score and endometrial thickness were assessed both before and 3 months after treatment. The endometrial biopsies obtained before and after treatment were stained for ΔNp63, Ki67, estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), and von Willebrand factor (vWF), and quantification of positive staining was performed to evaluate endometrial molecular features.</p>
