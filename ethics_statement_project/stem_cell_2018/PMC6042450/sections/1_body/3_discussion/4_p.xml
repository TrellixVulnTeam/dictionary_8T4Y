<p id="Par43">The uterus is a hollow viscera, which makes it difficult to provide an attachment site for stem cells during cell therapy. Most of the previous stem cell treatments employed the methods of intravenous injection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] or uterine artery injection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Under those conditions, it is difficult for any type of stem cell to colonize within the uterus, weakening the regenerative effects of stem cells. Although a few studies have reported that stem cells can be injected into the basalis layer of the endometrium when guided by ultrasound [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], it is difficult to maintain those cells in the correct layer and to cover the entire inner surface of the uterus. In our study, we took advantage of a collagen scaffold to provide an attachment site for the MSCs and to maintain a high density of UC-MSCs at the injury site to improve endometrial regeneration. According to our STR results, the role of UC-MSC/collagen in endometrial regeneration may be related to the improvement of multiple factors within the regenerative environment instead of directly participating in the reconstruction of the endometrium. This result was in accordance with finding reported by de Windt et al. [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the present study, UC-MSC/collagen downregulated ΔNp63 expression levels, which may be a contributing factor for the regeneration of the endometrium.
