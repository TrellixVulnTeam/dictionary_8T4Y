<p id="Par44">This study showed the safety and efficacy of transplanting clinical-grade UC-MSCs loaded onto a degradable collagen scaffold into the uterine cavity following adhesiolysis surgery for recurrent IUA patients. By gathering stem cells, maintaining their viability, and increasing the duration of contact with the damaged site of the endometrium, the capacity for endometrial proliferation and differentiation was improved significantly by the use of a scaffold. These results indicate a promising future for patients with AS for whom hysteroscopic treatment has failed.</p>
