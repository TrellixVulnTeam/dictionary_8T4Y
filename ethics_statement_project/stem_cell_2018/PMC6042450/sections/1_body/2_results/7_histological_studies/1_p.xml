<p id="Par36">In this study, endometrial biopsies from the first and second hysteroscopic inspections in 25 patients were studied to determine the histological and molecular changes before and after the treatment. We detected the ectopic expression of ΔNp63 in the endometria and showed 16 of 25 patients had ΔNp63-positive endometrial epithelial cells prior to treatment, which was consistent with our previous report [
