<p id="Par34">The second-look hysteroscopic inspections were performed in 25 patients at 3 months after the procedure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Comparing the inspections performed before and after the surgery, the mean IUA score of the 25 patients decreased from 9.12 ± 1.51 to 5.52 ± 3.22. Particularly, ten patients were found to have normal uterine cavities, of whom four patients had no intrauterine adhesion following cell therapy (Patient Nos. 3, 15, 18, 20), and six patients showed mild adhesion. Ten patients recovered from severe AS to moderate AS, and the remaining five patients showed no improvement (Fig.
