<p id="Par29">The clinical-grade UC-MSCs were isolated and cultured in a GMP workshop (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Supplementary material). A flow chart demonstrating the bioprocesses utilized during UC-MSC preparation for clinical use was designed and included cell isolation, expansion, characterization, certification, and safety assessment prior to transplantation (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1A). Homogeneous, fibroblastic-shaped cells were observed under a microscope during the process of cell expansion (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1B). Phenotypic analysis and differentiation experiments were performed from P9 to P14 to characterize the UC-MSCs (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1A, C and D). Flow cytometry analysis showed that the purity of the UC-MSCs was greater than 98%, which was confirmed by the high positive rates of CD105, CD73, CD90 and CD29, while the hematopoietic markers CD45 and CD34 were negative (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1C). Immunofluorescence staining results demonstrated the specific expression of FABP, osteocalcin and aggrecan in isolated cells (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1D). Immunohistochemical staining using Oil-red O, Alizarin Red and Alcian blue exhibited the presence of lipids, mineralized plaques and cartilaginous substrates derived from hUC-MSCs, respectively (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1D). UC-MSCs (P10/P15/P20) were subjected to the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (NIFDC) guidelines for a series of biosafety evaluations and those results are summarized in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S1. The cells were accredited by the NIFDC (report number SH201401380), according to Chinese regulations.
