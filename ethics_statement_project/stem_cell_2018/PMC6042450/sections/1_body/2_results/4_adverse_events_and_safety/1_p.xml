<p id="Par33">In order to assess the safety of the treatment, we determined the surgical complications, systemic and local safety after the surgery. No surgical complications were identified during the surgery. Body temperatures, hemograms, and vaginal discharge following the operation were normal. The average of white blood cell count (5.96 
 <bold>±</bold> 1.46 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L), neutrophil percentage (52.2 
 <bold>±</bold> 8.99%) and C-reactive protein (2.27 
 <bold>±</bold> 0.43 mg/L) at 1 day after surgery were presented to be normal (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S2). No inflammation reaction was detected from the endometrial biopsies 3 months after surgery (Additional file
