<p id="Par14">Stem cells have been shown to contribute to the repair and regeneration of the endometrium [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Some small case studies and case reports have documented that the injection of autologous stem cells (from bone marrow, peripheral blood or menstrual blood) into the uterine wall or into uterine blood vessels can improve endometrium regeneration in AS patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Of note, the quantity and quality of autologous stem cells have varied among patients and with different processing methods, which can influence the therapeutic outcomes of patients. Because of the safety and efficacy of using umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSCs) to support the regeneration of damaged tissues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], we developed a novel therapy using clinical-grade UC-MSCs to treat AS patients. In this treatment, a complex of UC-MSCs supported by a degradable collagen scaffold was transplanted into the uterine cavity of post-adhesiolysis surgical patients. By gathering stem cells, maintaining their viability [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and increasing the duration of contact with the damaged site of the endometrium [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], the capacity for endometrial proliferation and differentiation was improved significantly. Here, we report the results of this phase I clinical trial.
