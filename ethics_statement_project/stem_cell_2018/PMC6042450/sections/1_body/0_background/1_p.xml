<p id="Par13">Asherman syndrome (AS) is characterized by severe damage of the endometrium due to curettage and/or endometritis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Approximately 25â€“30% of infertile women suffer from AS, which represents the most common cause of uterine infertility [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The traditional treatment for AS is the transcervical resection of adhesion by hysteroscopy followed by the placement of an intrauterine device, Foley catheter or biomaterials to prevent recurrent intrauterine adhesions (IUA) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and hormonal therapy to regenerate the endometrium [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, in severe cases, the incidence of recurrent IUA was reported to be as high as 62.5% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This endometrial fibrosis impedes embryo implantation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, preventing IUA recurrence and endometrial scarring are considered key factors that affect therapeutic outcomes [
