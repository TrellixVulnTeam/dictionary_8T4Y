Although current stem cell treatment options using different types of autologous stem cells have exhibited some beneficial outcomes in IUA patients, the reported drawbacks include variable therapeutic efficacies, invasiveness and treatment unavailability. Therefore, the development of new therapeutic stem cell treatments is critical to improving clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Twenty-six patients who suffered from infertility caused by recurrent IUA were enrolled in this prospective, non-controlled, phase I clinical trial with a 30-month follow-up. During the procedure, 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>7</sup> umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSCs), loaded onto a collagen scaffold, were transplanted into the uterine cavity following an adhesion separation procedure. Medical history, physical examination, endometrial thickness, intrauterine adhesion score and the biological molecules related to endometrial proliferation and differentiation were assessed both before and 3&#x000a0;months after cell therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">No treatment-related serious adverse events were found. Three months after the operation, the average maximum endometrial thickness in patients increased, and the intrauterine adhesion score decreased compared to those before the treatment. A histological study showed the upregulation of ER&#x003b1; (estrogen receptor &#x003b1;), vimentin, Ki67 and vWF (von Willebrand factor) expression levels and the downregulation of &#x00394;NP63 expression level, which indicates an improvement in endometrial proliferation, differentiation and neovascularization following treatment. DNA short tandem repeat (STR) analysis showed that the regenerated endometrium contained patient DNA only. By the end of the 30-month follow-up period, ten of the 26 patients had become pregnant, and eight of them had delivered live babies with no obvious birth defects and without placental complications, one patient in the third trimester of pregnancy, and one had a spontaneous abortion at 7 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Transplanting clinical-grade UC-MSCs loaded onto a degradable collagen scaffold into the uterine cavity of patients with recurrent IUA following adhesiolysis surgery is a safety and effective therapeutic method.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">Clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02313415">NCT02313415</ext-link>, Registered December 6, 2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s13287-018-0904-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Asherman syndrome</kwd><kwd>Intrauterine adhesions</kwd><kwd>Uterine infertility</kwd><kwd>UC-MSCs</kwd><kwd>Collagen scaffold</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></funding-source><award-id>XDA01030505</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Jiangsu Provincial Key Medical Center</institution></funding-source><award-id>yxzxb2016004</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Jiangsu Translational Medicine Program</institution></funding-source><award-id>BE2016612</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Jiangsu Biobank of Clinical Resources</institution></funding-source><award-id>BM2015004</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Excellent Youth Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province</institution></funding-source><award-id>BK20170051</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par13">Asherman syndrome (AS) is characterized by severe damage of the endometrium due to curettage and/or endometritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Approximately 25&#x02013;30% of infertile women suffer from AS, which represents the most common cause of uterine infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The traditional treatment for AS is the transcervical resection of adhesion by hysteroscopy followed by the placement of an intrauterine device, Foley catheter or biomaterials to prevent recurrent intrauterine adhesions (IUA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and hormonal therapy to regenerate the endometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, in severe cases, the incidence of recurrent IUA was reported to be as high as 62.5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This endometrial fibrosis impedes embryo implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, preventing IUA recurrence and endometrial scarring are considered key factors that affect therapeutic outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Stem cells have been shown to contribute to the repair and regeneration of the endometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Some small case studies and case reports have documented that the injection of autologous stem cells (from bone marrow, peripheral blood or menstrual blood) into the uterine wall or into uterine blood vessels can improve endometrium regeneration in AS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Of note, the quantity and quality of autologous stem cells have varied among patients and with different processing methods, which can influence the therapeutic outcomes of patients. Because of the safety and efficacy of using umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSCs) to support the regeneration of damaged tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], we developed a novel therapy using clinical-grade UC-MSCs to treat AS patients. In this treatment, a complex of UC-MSCs supported by a degradable collagen scaffold was transplanted into the uterine cavity of post-adhesiolysis surgical patients. By gathering stem cells, maintaining their viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and increasing the duration of contact with the damaged site of the endometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], the capacity for endometrial proliferation and differentiation was improved significantly. Here, we report the results of this phase I clinical trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study enrollment and inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p id="Par15">These findings are the mid-term results of a prospective, experimental, non-controlled, phase I clinical trial supported by investigator-driven funding. The inclusion criteria included secondary infertility or embryo transfer failure caused by recurrent IUA, a desire to be pregnant, an age of less than 45&#x000a0;years, and agreeing to participate in the study. Patients were excluded from recruitment if they had any of the following issues: having hysteroscopy contraindications, chromosome karyotype abnormalities, congenital uterine malformations, severe adenomyosis, contraindications to pregnancy, contraindications to estradiol treatment, medical history of pelvic malignant tumors, previous experience with pelvic radiotherapy. For patients who met the indications for stem cell therapy, written informed consent was obtained. Patients with recurrent IUA were diagnosed according to their history profiles, and three experienced gynecologists at the Drum Tower Hospital performed hysteroscopy examinations for severity classification using the American Fertility Society scoring method (The American Fertility Society, 1988) during the screening process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Preparation of the UC-MSC /collagen complex</title><p id="Par16">The regeneration-induced functional complex was made as follows: a 4&#x000a0;cm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;6&#x000a0;cm collagen scaffold with pores of 20&#x02013;200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m in diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] (Zhenghai Biotechnology Company, Shandong, China) was rinsed with xeno-free MSC culture medium (MesenCult&#x02122; MSC Basal Medium, Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada), excess fluid was aspirated, and a suspension of 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>7</sup> (about 4.2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>) UC-MSCs was dripped uniformly onto the scaffold.

The endometrial adhesions were separated using non-electrified micro scissors until an anatomical uterine cavity with slight staxis was observed. The UC-MSC/collagen scaffold complex was spread onto an 18F Foley catheter and placed into the uterine cavity, and then an infill catheter bulb containing 3&#x000a0;ml of saline was used to attach the scaffold to the inner wall of uterine cavity. After 12&#x000a0;h, the catheter was removed after withdrawing saline in the bulb. The procedure was performed following 10&#x000a0;days of 6&#x000a0;mg/day Progynova (estradiol) (menstrual period day 13). Continuous administration of the same dosage of Progynova, lasting for 30&#x000a0;days following the operation, and 60&#x000a0;mg of progesterone was injected on the 30th day post-operation.

A second-look hysteroscopic inspection was performed still at the late proliferation phase, 3&#x000a0;months after UC-MSC transplantation, by the same gynecologist. The IUA score and the anatomy of the uterine cavity were evaluated during this hysteroscopic inspection. At the same time, endometrial biopsies were performed by sampling endometrial tissues at the location of the first biopsies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Pregnancy outcome</title><p id="Par22">If the anatomy of the uterine cavity was normal 3 months after the operation, embryo transfer or spontaneous pregnancy was prepared for these patients.

The successful rate of hysteroscopic treatment varies in previous literature. High grades of adhesions are predictive of an increased risk for the spontaneous recurrence of adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For patients with severe recurrent AS, hysteroscopic treatment failure may represent refractory uterine infertility.</p><p id="Par41">Alternative salvage methods have been investigated. Stem cells targeting endometrial regeneration have been reported and investigated since 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">In 2011, a case study reporting the placement of autologous BMSCs into the uterine cavity after curettage showed that the transplantation increased endometrial proliferation in a severe AS patient, who was then able to experience 8&#x000a0;weeks of pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In 2014, a report on the subendometrial injection of CD34+ or cultured autologous BMCs in severe AS patients showed a slight increase in the endometrial thickness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In 2016, a case study was reported on 16 patients with refractory infertility who received autologous peripheral blood CD133+ cells into the spiral arteries of the uterus and were observed to experience endometrial reconstruction; two of the 16 patients with AS and one patient with a thin endometrium had live births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In the same year, a report on the transplantation of autologous menstrual blood-derived stromal cells into seven severe AS patients showed that two of them successfully conceived. In our previous study, we reported a successful transplanting of autologous mononuclear cells from the bone marrow/collagen complex into patients with severe IUA, who achieved pregnancies and live births after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the current study, we report the results of the first phase I clinical trial of a clinical use-approved UC-MSC/collagen scaffold for the treatment of recurrent IUA. We demonstrate the clinical safety and efficacy of a clinical-grade UC-MSC/collagen scaffold. The UC-MSCs were obtained noninvasively. The hypoimmunogenic and nontumorigenic features of UC-MSCs make them especially advantageous for use in regenerative treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, UC-MSCs can occupy an intermediate position between the most versatile pluripotent ESCs/iPSCs and adult tissue-specific MSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Finally, but more importantly, it is easy to ensure quality control during the standardized production of UC-MSCs.</p><p id="Par43">The uterus is a hollow viscera, which makes it difficult to provide an attachment site for stem cells during cell therapy. Most of the previous stem cell treatments employed the methods of intravenous injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] or uterine artery injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Under those conditions, it is difficult for any type of stem cell to colonize within the uterus, weakening the regenerative effects of stem cells. Although a few studies have reported that stem cells can be injected into the basalis layer of the endometrium when guided by ultrasound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], it is difficult to maintain those cells in the correct layer and to cover the entire inner surface of the uterus. In our study, we took advantage of a collagen scaffold to provide an attachment site for the MSCs and to maintain a high density of UC-MSCs at the injury site to improve endometrial regeneration. According to our STR results, the role of UC-MSC/collagen in endometrial regeneration may be related to the improvement of multiple factors within the regenerative environment instead of directly participating in the reconstruction of the endometrium. This result was in accordance with finding reported by de Windt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]&#x03002; Ectopic &#x00394;Np63 expression in endometrial epithelial cells inhibits the proliferation and differentiation of the endometrium in IUA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the present study, UC-MSC/collagen downregulated &#x00394;Np63 expression levels, which may be a contributing factor for the regeneration of the endometrium.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par44">This study showed the safety and efficacy of transplanting clinical-grade UC-MSCs loaded onto a degradable collagen scaffold into the uterine cavity following adhesiolysis surgery for recurrent IUA patients. By gathering stem cells, maintaining their viability, and increasing the duration of contact with the damaged site of the endometrium, the capacity for endometrial proliferation and differentiation was improved significantly by the use of a scaffold. These results indicate a promising future for patients with AS for whom hysteroscopic treatment has failed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec28"><p>
