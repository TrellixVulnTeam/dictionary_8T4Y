By generating a fingerprint for pattern comparison and then complementing the data with a clone library, resolving peaks using a database, and performing multivariate analysis, TRFLP can reveal the differences in unknown microbial communities in various environmental samples (Liu et al.,   1997 ). T-RFLP was applied to investigate the composition and succession of bacterial communities after the oil spill and successfully revealed the relatively higher contribution of the bacterial group   Flavobacteria , which is a secondary consumer of methane, oil, or cellular decay products (Redmond and Valentine,   2011 ). Profiles generated by TRFLP indicated that up to 56% of the total bacteria in plume samples collected in September 2010 were affiliated with   Flavobacteria , whereas this number was only 10–30% when 16S rRNA gene-based clone library techniques were applied (Redmond and Valentine,   2011 ). In a recent study, the TRFLP analysis for community composition of ammonia oxidizers in salt marshes after the DWH oil spill revealed that exposure to oil, even 2 years post-spill, could contribute to subtle changes in population dynamics of bacterial communities (Bernhard et al.,   2016 ). Although T-RFLP could provide more authentic data compared to clone libraries, it could still underestimate community diversity, especially when complex and large amounts of data were applied. In the abovementioned study (Redmond and Valentine,   2011 ), some terminal restriction fragments could be assigned to multiple groups. Due to the significant overlaps between the   methanotrophs, methylotrophs , and some other γ-  proteobacteria , it was not possible to distinguish the δ-  proteobacteria, Actinobacteria , and SAR406 clades from each other. Nevertheless, some groups, such as   Flavobacteria , α-  proteobacteria , and γ-  proteobacteria  could be readily differentiated.",['collected in'],1,"['Profiles generated by TRFLP indicated that up to 56% of the total bacteria in plume samples collected in September 2010 were affiliated with   Flavobacteria , whereas this number was only 10–30% when 16S rRNA gene-based clone library techniques were applied (Redmond and Valentine,   2011 ).']",[[]],[[]],[[]],[[]],[['collected in']]

Samples were dried in well-ventilated spaces away from sunlight. Samples were then placed at 50°C to dry the samples to a constant, dry weight and disintegrated through a 90-mesh sieve. Air-dried plant materials were hydrodistilled using a Clevenger-type apparatus. The composition of   M. alternifolia  essential oil was analyzed in the laboratory using Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a cross-linked 5% PH ME siloxane Hewlett-Packard-5MS capillary column (25 m × 0.25 mm ID, 0.25   μ m film thickness), coupled to a Hewlett-Packard 5972A mass spectrometer (Hewlett-Packard Ltd., Bracknell, UK). The GC operating conditions were as follows: helium as carrier gas with a flow rate 2.0 ml/min; column temperature programming from 60°C to 275°C at 4°C/min; injector and FID detector temperatures of 215 and 275°C, respectively. The MS operating parameters were as follows: ionization potential, 70 ev; resolution, 1000; ion source temperature, 250°C. Identification of components was based on GC retention indices and the fragmentation patterns of the mass spectra with those of authentic samples, as well as the NIST 98 and HPCH 2205 GC–MS libraries.
