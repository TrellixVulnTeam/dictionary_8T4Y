It produces beautiful flowers with a mild fragrance and colorful seed pods. Unlike many other cultivated roses, R. rugosa adapts to a wide range of habitat types and harsh environmental conditions such as salinity, alkaline, shade, drought, high humidity, and frigid temperatures. Here, we produced and analyzed a high-quality genome sequence for R. rugosa to understand its ecology, floral characteristics and evolution. PacBio HiFi reads were initially used to construct the draft genome of R. rugosa, and then Hi-C sequencing was applied to assemble the contigs into 7 chromosomes. We obtained a 382.6\u2009Mb genome encoding 39,704 protein-coding genes. The genome of R. rugosa appears to be conserved with no additional whole-genome duplication after the gamma whole-genome triplication (WGT), which occurred ~100 million years ago in the ancestor of core eudicots. Based on a comparative analysis of the high-quality genome assembly of R. rugosa and other high-quality Rosaceae genomes, we found a unique large inverted segment in the Chinese rose R. chinensis and a retroposition in strawberry caused by post-WGT events. We also found that floral development- and stress response signaling-related gene modules were retained after the WGT. Two MADS-box genes involved in floral development and the stress-related transcription factors DREB2A-INTERACTING PROTEIN 2 (DRIP2) and PEPTIDE TRANSPORTER 3 (PTR3) were found to be positively selected in evolution, which may have contributed to the unique ability of this plant to adapt to harsh environments.

Corn leaf aphid [CLA; Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch)] is an economically important pest of maize and several other monocot crops. In addition to feeding damage, CLA acts as a vector for viruses that cause devastating diseases in maize. We have shown previously that the maize inbred line Mp708, which was developed by classical plant breeding, provides heightened resistance to CLA. However, the transcriptomic variation conferring CLA resistance to Mp708 has not been investigated.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we contrasted the defense responses of the resistant Mp708 genotype to those of the susceptible Tx601 genotype at the transcriptomic (mRNA-seq) and volatile blend levels. Our results suggest that there was a greater transcriptomic remodeling in Mp708 plants in response to CLA infestation compared to the Tx601 plants.

Corn leaf aphid [CLA; Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch)] is an economically important pest of maize and several other monocot crops. In addition to feeding damage, CLA acts as a vector for viruses that cause devastating diseases in maize. We have shown previously that the maize inbred line Mp708, which was developed by classical plant breeding, provides heightened resistance to CLA. However, the transcriptomic variation conferring CLA resistance to Mp708 has not been investigated.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we contrasted the defense responses of the resistant Mp708 genotype to those of the susceptible Tx601 genotype at the transcriptomic (mRNA-seq) and volatile blend levels. Our results suggest that there was a greater transcriptomic remodeling in Mp708 plants in response to CLA infestation compared to the Tx601 plants. These transcriptomic signatures indicated an activation of hormonal pathways, and regulation of sesquiterpenes and terpenoid synthases in a constitutive and inducible manner. Transcriptomic analysis also revealed that the resistant Mp708 genotype possessed distinct regulation of ethylene and jasmonic acid pathways before and after aphid infestation.

Thidiazuron (TDZ) is a commonly used growth regulator in grape cultivation that stimulates larger berries and prevents fruit drop. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of TDZ on the production of aroma volatiles and to identify the key genes involved in the terpene biosynthesis pathways that are affected by this compound. Treatment with TDZ had a negative effect on the concentration of volatile compounds, especially on monoterpenes, which likely impacts the sensory characteristics of the fruit. The expression analysis of genes related to the monoterpenoid biosynthesis pathways confirmed that treatment with TDZ negatively regulated the key genes <i>DXS1</i>, <i>DXS3</i>, <i>DXR</i>, <i>HDR</i>, <i>VvPNGer</i> and <i>VvPNlinNer1</i>.

of urban greening and the pleasant aroma emitted from its flowers. The floral scent is determined by several monoterpenoid volatiles, such as linalool and its oxides, which are a few of the most common volatiles and the main components of the essential oils in most sweet osmanthus cultivars. In addition, the relative contents of <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-linalool oxide (furan) may affect the aromas and quality of the essential oils. MYB proteins represent the largest family of transcription factors in plants and participate in regulating secondary metabolites. Several <i>cis</i>-elements, especially AC-rich regions, are known to be bound by 2R-MYBs and could be found in the promoter of the enzyme genes in the terpenoid metabolic pathway. However, there has to date been no investigation into the 2R-MYB family genes involved in regulating terpenoid biosynthesis in <i>O. fragrans</i>. Here, 243 non-redundant 2R-MYB proteins were grouped into 33 clusters based on the phylogeny and exon-intron distribution. These genes were unevenly distributed on 23 chromosomes. Ka/Ks analysis showed that the major mode of 2R-MYB gene evolution was purifying selection. Expression analysis indicated that 2R-MYB genes in <i>O. fragrans</i> exhibited varied expression patterns. A total of 35 OfMYBs representing the highest per kilobase per million mapped reads in the flower were selected for quantitative real-time PCR analysis.

The floral scent is determined by several monoterpenoid volatiles, such as linalool and its oxides, which are a few of the most common volatiles and the main components of the essential oils in most sweet osmanthus cultivars. In addition, the relative contents of <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-linalool oxide (furan) may affect the aromas and quality of the essential oils. MYB proteins represent the largest family of transcription factors in plants and participate in regulating secondary metabolites. Several <i>cis</i>-elements, especially AC-rich regions, are known to be bound by 2R-MYBs and could be found in the promoter of the enzyme genes in the terpenoid metabolic pathway. However, there has to date been no investigation into the 2R-MYB family genes involved in regulating terpenoid biosynthesis in <i>O. fragrans</i>. Here, 243 non-redundant 2R-MYB proteins were grouped into 33 clusters based on the phylogeny and exon-intron distribution. These genes were unevenly distributed on 23 chromosomes. Ka/Ks analysis showed that the major mode of 2R-MYB gene evolution was purifying selection. Expression analysis indicated that 2R-MYB genes in <i>O. fragrans</i> exhibited varied expression patterns. A total of 35 OfMYBs representing the highest per kilobase per million mapped reads in the flower were selected for quantitative real-time PCR analysis. The correlation analysis between the expression level and the contents of fragrant compounds at different flowering stages suggested that <i>OfMYB19</i>/<i>20</i> exhibited remarkably positive correlation with the accumulation of <i>cis</i>-linalool oxides. <i>OfMYB51</i>/<i>65</i>/<i>88</i>/<i>121</i>/<i>137</i>/<i>144</i> showed significantly negative correlations with one or more linalool oxides.

We found that slow dehydration over a prolonged duration is necessary to induce gene expression and metabolite accumulation associated with the final quality traits of dehydrated berries. The accumulation of key metabolites (particularly stilbenoids) during postharvest dehydration is inhibited by rapid dehydration conditions that shorten the berry life time.", "Keywords": ["Gene Expression", "secondary metabolism"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7459318?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Horticulture research", "authorinfo": ["Zenoni S", "Amato A", "D'Inc\u00e0 E", "Guzzo F", "Tornielli GB"], "title": "Rapid dehydration of grape berries dampens the post-ripening transcriptomic program and the metabolite profile evolution."}, "PMC7890116": {"downloaded": false, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "33614607", "source": "MED", "pmid": "33614607", "pmcid": "PMC7890116", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC7890116"}, "doi": "10.3389/fbioe.2020.621127", "title": "High-Level Patchoulol Biosynthesis in <i>Artemisia annua</i> L.", "authorString": "Fu X, Zhang F, Ma Y, Hassani D, Peng B, Pan Q, Zhang Y, Deng Z, Liu W, Zhang J, Han L, Chen D, Zhao J, Li L, Sun X, Tang K.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Fu X", "firstName": "Xueqing", "lastName": "Fu", "initials": "X", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic & Developmental Sciences, Key Laboratory of Urban Agriculture (South) Ministry of Agriculture, Plant Biotechnology Research Center, Fudan-Shanghai Jiaotong University (SJTU)-Nottingham Plant Biotechnology R&D Center, School of Agriculture and Biology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Zhang F", "firstName": "Fangyuan", "lastName": "Zhang", "initials": "F", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic & Developmental Sciences, Key Laboratory of Urban Agriculture (South) Ministry of Agriculture, Plant Biotechnology Research Center, Fudan-Shanghai Jiaotong University (SJTU)-Nottingham Plant Biotechnology R&D Center, School of Agriculture and Biology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."}, {"affiliation": "Southwest University-Tibet Agriculture and Animal Husbandry College (SWU-TAAHC) Medicinal Plant Joint R&D Centre, School of Life Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, China."}]}}, {"fullName": "Ma Y", "firstName": "Yanan", "lastName": "Ma", "initials": "Y", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic & Developmental Sciences, Key Laboratory of Urban Agriculture (South) Ministry of Agriculture, Plant Biotechnology Research Center, Fudan-Shanghai Jiaotong University (SJTU)-Nottingham Plant Biotechnology R&D Center, School of Agriculture and Biology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Hassani D", "firstName": "Danial", "lastName": "Hassani", "initials": "D", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic & Developmental Sciences, Key Laboratory of Urban Agriculture (South) Ministry of Agriculture, Plant Biotechnology Research Center, Fudan-Shanghai Jiaotong University (SJTU)-Nottingham Plant Biotechnology R&D Center, School of Agriculture and Biology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Peng B", "firstName": "Bowen", "lastName": "Peng", "initials": "B", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic & Developmental Sciences, Key Laboratory of Urban Agriculture (South) Ministry of Agriculture, Plant Biotechnology Research Center, Fudan-Shanghai Jiaotong University (SJTU)-Nottingham Plant Biotechnology R&D Center, School of Agriculture and Biology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Pan Q", "firstName": "Qifang", "lastName": "Pan", "initials": "Q", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic & Developmental Sciences, Key Laboratory of Urban Agriculture (South) Ministry of Agriculture, Plant Biotechnology Research Center, Fudan-Shanghai Jiaotong University (SJTU)-Nottingham Plant Biotechnology R&D Center, School of Agriculture and Biology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Zhang Y", "firstName": "Yuhua", "lastName": "Zhang", "initials": "Y", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Corporate R&D Division, Firmenich Aromatics (China) Co.

Linalool extraction from natural plant tissues suffers from low product yield. Although linalool can also be chemically synthesized, its enantioselective production is difficult. Microbial production of terpenes has recently emerged as a novel, environmental-friendly alternative. Stereoselective production can also be achieved using this approach via enzymatic reactions. We previously succeeded in producing enantiopure (S)-linalool using a metabolically engineered Pantoea ananatis, a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family of bacteria, via the heterologous mevalonate pathway with the highest linalool titer ever reported from engineered microbes.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we genetically modified a previously developed P. ananatis strain expressing the (S)-linalool synthase (AaLINS) from Actinidia arguta to further improve (S)-linalool production. AaLINS was mostly expressed as an insoluble form in P. ananatis; its soluble expression level was increased by N-terminal fusion of a halophilic \u03b2-lactamase from Chromohalobacter sp. 560 with hexahistidine. Furthermore, in combination with elevation of the precursor supply via the mevalonate pathway, the (S)-linalool titer was increased approximately 1.4-fold (4.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u00a0g/L) in comparison with the original strain (3.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\u00a0g/L) in test-tube cultivation with an aqueous-organic biphasic fermentation system using isopropyl myristate as the organic solvent for in situ extraction of cytotoxic and semi-volatile (S)-linalool. The most productive strain, IP04S/pBLAAaLINS-ispA*, produced 10.9\u00a0g/L of (S)-linalool in \"dual-phase\" fed-batch fermentation, which was divided into a growth-phase and a subsequent production-phase.

Linalool extraction from natural plant tissues suffers from low product yield. Although linalool can also be chemically synthesized, its enantioselective production is difficult. Microbial production of terpenes has recently emerged as a novel, environmental-friendly alternative. Stereoselective production can also be achieved using this approach via enzymatic reactions. We previously succeeded in producing enantiopure (S)-linalool using a metabolically engineered Pantoea ananatis, a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family of bacteria, via the heterologous mevalonate pathway with the highest linalool titer ever reported from engineered microbes.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we genetically modified a previously developed P. ananatis strain expressing the (S)-linalool synthase (AaLINS) from Actinidia arguta to further improve (S)-linalool production. AaLINS was mostly expressed as an insoluble form in P. ananatis; its soluble expression level was increased by N-terminal fusion of a halophilic \u03b2-lactamase from Chromohalobacter sp. 560 with hexahistidine. Furthermore, in combination with elevation of the precursor supply via the mevalonate pathway, the (S)-linalool titer was increased approximately 1.4-fold (4.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u00a0g/L) in comparison with the original strain (3.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\u00a0g/L) in test-tube cultivation with an aqueous-organic biphasic fermentation system using isopropyl myristate as the organic solvent for in situ extraction of cytotoxic and semi-volatile (S)-linalool. The most productive strain, IP04S/pBLAAaLINS-ispA*, produced 10.9\u00a0g/L of (S)-linalool in \"dual-phase\" fed-batch fermentation, which was divided into a growth-phase and a subsequent production-phase. Thus far, this is the highest reported titer in the production of not only linalool but also all monoterpenes using microbes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study demonstrates the potential of our metabolically engineered P. ananatis strain as a platform for economically feasible (S)-linalool production and provides insights into the stereoselective production of terpenes with high efficiency.

This study contributes to a better understanding of the correlation between environment factors and HLB disease outbreaks and also suggests that acid soil improvement is of potential value for the management of HLB disease in southern China.", "Keywords": ["Salicylic acid", "Huanglongbing", "Soil acidification", "Plant Immune Response", "Root Metabolic Activity"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7279377?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "International journal of molecular sciences", "authorinfo": ["Li B", "Wang S", "Zhang Y", "Qiu D"], "title": "Acid Soil Improvement Enhances Disease Tolerance in Citrus Infected by <i>Candidatus</i> Liberibacter asiaticus."}, "PMC7890063": {"downloaded": false, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "33597725", "source": "MED", "pmid": "33597725", "pmcid": "PMC7890063", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC7890063"}, "doi": "10.1038/s42003-021-01715-z", "title": "Bioinformatics-aided identification, characterization and applications of mushroom linalool synthases.", "authorString": "Zhang C, Chen X, Lee RTC, T R, Maurer-Stroh S, R\u00fchl M.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Zhang C", "firstName": "Congqiang", "lastName": "Zhang", "initials": "C", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-1070-8806"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Singapore Institute of Food and Biotechnology Innovation (SIFBI), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, Singapore. congqiang_zhang@sifbi.a-star.edu.sg."}}}, {"fullName": "Chen X", "firstName": "Xixian", "lastName": "Chen", "initials": "X", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Singapore Institute of Food and Biotechnology Innovation (SIFBI), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, Singapore."}}}, {"fullName": "Lee RTC", "firstName": "Raphael Tze Chuen", "lastName": "Lee", "initials": "RTC", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Bioinformatics Institute (BII), Agency for Science Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, Singapore."}}}, {"fullName": "T R", "firstName": "Rehka", "lastName": "T", "initials": "R", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Singapore Institute of Food and Biotechnology Innovation (SIFBI), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, Singapore."}}}, {"fullName": "Maurer-Stroh S", "firstName": "Sebastian", "lastName": "Maurer-Stroh", "initials": "S", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-0813-9640"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Bioinformatics Institute (BII), Agency for Science Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, Singapore."}, {"affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences (DBS), National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore, Singapore."}]}}, {"fullName": "R\u00fchl M", "firstName": "Martin", "lastName": "R\u00fchl", "initials": "M", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Institute of Food Chemistry and Food Biotechnology, Justus Liebig University Giessen, Giessen, Germany."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-0813-9640"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-1070-8806"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "1", "volume": "4", "journalIssueId": "3104234", "dateOfPublication": "2021 Feb", "monthOfPublication": "2", "yearOfPublication": "2021", "printPublicationDate": "2021-02-01", "journal": {"title": "Communications biology", "ISOAbbreviation": "Commun Biol", "medlineAbbreviation": "Commun Biol", "NLMid": "101719179", "ISSN": "2399-3642", "ESSN": "2399-3642"}}, "pubYear": "2021", "pageInfo": "223", "abstractText": "Enzymes empower chemical industries and are the keystone for metabolic engineering.

Individuals of some chemotypes may respond more efficiently to herbivory stress than others, and in a group environment these \"louder\" chemotypes may affect the local insect community, including the natural enemies of herbivores, and other neighbouring plants.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7724791?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "BMC plant biology", "authorinfo": ["Clancy MV", "Haberer G", "Jud W", "Niederbacher B", "Niederbacher S", "Senft M", "Zytynska SE", "Weisser WW", "Schnitzler JP"], "title": "Under fire-simultaneous volatilome and transcriptome analysis unravels fine-scale responses of tansy chemotypes to dual herbivore attack."}, "PMC6656997": {"downloaded": false, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "31372559", "source": "MED", "pmid": "31372559", "pmcid": "PMC6656997", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC6656997"}, "doi": "10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e02111", "title": "Effects of ultraviolet irradiation on the <i>in vitro</i> antagonistic potential of <i>Trichoderma</i> spp. against soil-borne fungal pathogens.", "authorString": "Alfiky A.", "authorList": {"author": {"fullName": "Alfiky A", "firstName": "Alsayed", "lastName": "Alfiky", "initials": "A", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Genetics Department, Faculty of Agriculture, Tanta University, Egypt."}}}}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": "altmetrics"}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "7", "volume": "5", "journalIssueId": "2839556", "dateOfPublication": "2019 Jul", "monthOfPublication": "7", "yearOfPublication": "2019", "printPublicationDate": "2019-07-01", "journal": {"title": "Heliyon", "ISOAbbreviation": "Heliyon", "medlineAbbreviation": "Heliyon", "NLMid": "101672560", "ISSN": "2405-8440", "ESSN": "2405-8440"}}, "pubYear": "2019", "pageInfo": "e02111", "abstractText": "Development of new effective biocontrol agents is largely based on the antagonistic capacity of candidate agents against targeted pathogens <i>in vitro</i>.

Another 16 VOCs correlated strongly with expression profiles of eleven key genes in the lipoxygenase pathway, and both expression profiles and VOCs discriminated amongst cultivars, peach versus nectarines and between treatments.

Totally 80 TPS-like genes were identified. Twenty-three CsTPS genes possessed a complete coding sequence and most likely were functional. The remaining 57 in the currently available database lack essential gene structure or full-length transcripts. Distinct tempo-spatial expression patterns of CsTPS genes were found in tea plants. 17 genes were substantially expressed in all the tested organs with a few exceptions. The other 17 were predominantly expressed in leaves whereas additional eight were primarily expressed in flowers. Under the treatments of cold acclimation, salt and polyethylene glycol, CsTPS67, -69 and -71 were all suppressed and the inhibited expression of many others were found in multiple stress treatments.

In the full-length transcriptome of C. porrectum, 104,062 transcripts with 306,337,921 total bp, an average length of 2944 bp, and an N50 length of 5449 bp, were obtained and 94025 transcripts were annotated. In the eucalyptol and linalool chemotype, the camphor and eucalyptol chemotype, and the camphor and linalool chemotype comparison groups, 21, 22 and 18 terpene synthase (TPS) unigenes were identified respectively. Three monoterpene synthase genes, CpTPS3, CpTPS5 and CpTPS9, were upregulated in the eucalyptol chemotype compared to the linalool chemotype and camphor chemotype. CpTPS1 was upregulated in the camphor chemotype compared to the linalool chemotype and the eucalyptol chemotype. CpTPS4 was upregulated in the linalool chemotype compared to the camphor chemotype and the eucalyptol chemotype. Different unigenes had different expression levels among the three chemotypes, but the unigene expression levels of the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4phosphate (MEP) pathway were generally higher than those of the mevalonate acid (MVA) pathway. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR(qRT-PCR) further validated these expression levels. The present study provides new clues for the functional exploration of the terpenoid synthesis mechanism and key genes in different chemotypes of C. porrectum.", "Keywords": ["Terpenoids", "Terpenoid Biosynthesis", "Full-length Transcriptome", "Cinnamomum Porrectum", "Different Chemotypes"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6941020?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "International journal of molecular sciences", "authorinfo": ["Qiu F", "Wang X", "Zheng Y", "Wang H", "Liu X", "Su X"], "title": "Full-Length Transcriptome Sequencing and Different Chemotype Expression Profile Analysis of Genes Related to Monoterpenoid Biosynthesis in Cinnamomum porrectum."}, "PMC6399326": {"downloaded": false, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "30833587", "source": "MED", "pmid": "30833587", "pmcid": "PMC6399326", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC6399326"}, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-019-39088-3", "title": "Selection and Validation of Reference Genes for Gene Expression Studies by RT-PCR in Dalbergia odorifera.", "authorString": "Meng H, Yang Y, Gao ZH, Wei JH.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Meng H", "firstName": "Hui", "lastName": "Meng", "initials": "H", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100193, China."}, {"affiliation": "Hainan Branch Institute of Medicinal Plant Development (Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Resources Conservation and Development of Southern Medicine), Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Haikou, 570311, China."}]}}, {"fullName": "Yang Y", "firstName": "Yun", "lastName": "Yang", "initials": "Y", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100193, China."}, {"affiliation": "Hainan Branch Institute of Medicinal Plant Development (Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Resources Conservation and Development of Southern Medicine), Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Haikou, 570311, China."}]}}, {"fullName": "Gao ZH", "firstName": "Zhi-Hui", "lastName": "Gao", "initials": "ZH", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100193, China. huihuigao@163.com."}}}, {"fullName": "Wei JH", "firstName": "Jian-He", "lastName": "Wei", "initials": "JH", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100193, China. wjianh@263.net."}, {"affiliation": "Hainan Branch Institute of Medicinal Plant Development (Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Resources Conservation and Development of Southern Medicine), Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Haikou, 570311, China. wjianh@263.net."}]}}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": "supporting_data"}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "1", "volume": "9", "journalIssueId": "2787935", "dateOfPublication": "2019 Mar", "monthOfPublication": "3", "yearOfPublication": "2019", "printPublicationDate": "2019-03-01", "journal": {"title": "Scientific reports", "ISOAbbreviation": "Sci Rep", "medlineAbbreviation": "Sci Rep", "NLMid": "101563288", "ISSN": "2045-2322", "ESSN": "2045-2322"}}, "pubYear": "2019", "pageInfo": "3341", "abstractText": "Perennial tree Dalbergia odorifera T.

"BACKGROUND:Massive techniques have been evaluated for developing different pest control methods to minimize fertilizer and pesticide inputs. As \"push-pull\" strategy utilizes generally non-toxic chemicals to manipulate behaviors of insects, such strategy is considered to be environmentally friendly. \"Push-pull\" strategy has been extraordinarily effective in controlling stem borers, and the identification of new \"pushing\" or \"pull\" components against stem borers could be significantly helpful. RESULTS:In this study, the results of field trapping assay and behavioral assay showed the larvae of C.auricilius, one kind of stem borers, could be deterred by rice plant under tilling stage, its main host crop. The profiles of volatiles were compared between rice plants under two different developmental stages, and \u03b1-pinene was identified as a key differential component. The repelling activity of \u03b1-pinene against C.auricilius was confirmed by Y-tube olfactometer.

D. carota tissues produce an essential oil that is rich in volatile terpenes and plays a major role in carrot aroma and flavor. Although terpene composition represents a critical quality attribute of carrots, little is known about the biosynthesis of terpenes in this crop. Here, we functionally characterized 19 terpene synthase (TPS) genes in an orange carrot (genotype DH1) and compared tissue-specific expression profiles and in vitro products of their recombinant proteins with volatile terpene profiles from DH1 and four other colored carrot genotypes. In addition to the previously reported (E)-\u03b2-caryophyllene synthase (DcTPS01), we biochemically characterized several TPS proteins with direct correlations to major compounds of carrot flavor and aroma including germacrene\u00a0D (DcTPS7/11), \u03b3-terpinene (DcTPS30) and \u03b1-terpinolene (DcTPS03).

D. carota tissues produce an essential oil that is rich in volatile terpenes and plays a major role in carrot aroma and flavor. Although terpene composition represents a critical quality attribute of carrots, little is known about the biosynthesis of terpenes in this crop. Here, we functionally characterized 19 terpene synthase (TPS) genes in an orange carrot (genotype DH1) and compared tissue-specific expression profiles and in vitro products of their recombinant proteins with volatile terpene profiles from DH1 and four other colored carrot genotypes. In addition to the previously reported (E)-\u03b2-caryophyllene synthase (DcTPS01), we biochemically characterized several TPS proteins with direct correlations to major compounds of carrot flavor and aroma including germacrene\u00a0D (DcTPS7/11), \u03b3-terpinene (DcTPS30) and \u03b1-terpinolene (DcTPS03). Random forest analysis of volatiles from colored carrot cultivars identified nine terpenes that were clearly distinct among the cultivars and likely contribute to differences in sensory quality.

We report the diversity of terpene profiles across samples bound for the Washington dispensary market. The remarkable degree of variation in terpene profiles ultimately results from action of a family of terpene synthase genes, only some of which have been described. Using a recently available genome assembly we describe 55 terpene synthases with genomic context, and tissue specific expression.

Most <i>Thymus</i> molecular research has focused on the determining the phylogenetic relationships between different species, but no published work has focused on the evolution of the transcriptome across the genus to elucidate genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. Hence, in this study, the transcriptomes of five different <i>Thymus</i> species were generated and analyzed to mine putative genes involved in thymol and carvacrol biosynthesis. High-throughput sequencing produced ~43 million high-quality reads per sample, which were assembled de novo using several tools, then further subjected to a quality evaluation. The best assembly for each species was used as queries to search within the UniProt, KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes), COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) and TF (Transcription Factors) databases.

"abstractText": "Fungi are successful eukaryotes of wide distribution. They are known as rich producers of secondary metabolites, especially terpenoids, which are important for fungi-environment interactions. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is an important mechanism contributing to genetic innovation of fungi. However, it remains unclear whether HGT has played a role in creating the enormous chemical diversity of fungal terpenoids. Here we report that fungi have acquired terpene synthase genes (TPSs), which encode pivotal enzymes for terpenoid biosynthesis, from bacteria through HGT. Phylogenetic analysis placed the majority of fungal and bacterial TPS genes from diverse taxa into two clades, indicating ancient divergence. Nested in the bacterial TPS clade is a number of fungal TPS genes that are inferred as the outcome of HGT. These include a monophyletic clade of nine fungal TPS genes, designated as BTPSL for bacterial TPS-like genes, from eight species of related entomopathogenic fungi, including seven TPSs from six species in the genus Metarhizium.

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is an important mechanism contributing to genetic innovation of fungi. However, it remains unclear whether HGT has played a role in creating the enormous chemical diversity of fungal terpenoids. Here we report that fungi have acquired terpene synthase genes (TPSs), which encode pivotal enzymes for terpenoid biosynthesis, from bacteria through HGT. Phylogenetic analysis placed the majority of fungal and bacterial TPS genes from diverse taxa into two clades, indicating ancient divergence. Nested in the bacterial TPS clade is a number of fungal TPS genes that are inferred as the outcome of HGT. These include a monophyletic clade of nine fungal TPS genes, designated as BTPSL for bacterial TPS-like genes, from eight species of related entomopathogenic fungi, including seven TPSs from six species in the genus Metarhizium.

It has been reported to be valuable in medical applications, such as alleviation of allergic asthma, gliosis, and edema as well as anti-cancerous and anti-inflammatory effects. Coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> (CoQ<sub>10</sub>), an essential cofactor in the aerobic respiratory electron transport chain, has attracted growing interest owing to its clinical benefits and important applications in the pharmaceutical, food, and health industries. In this work, co-production of (E,E)-farnesol (FOH) and CoQ<sub>10</sub> was achieved by combining 3 different exogenous terpenes or sesquiterpene synthase with the RNA interference of psy (responsible for phytoene synthesis in Rhodobacter sphaeroides GY-2).<h4>Results</h4>FOH production was significantly increased by overexpressing exogenous terpene synthase (TPS), phosphatidylglycerophosphatase B (PgpB), and sesquiterpene synthase (ATPS), as well as RNAi-mediated silencing of psy coding phytoene synthase (PSY) in R. sphaeroides strains. Rs-TPS, Rs-ATPS, and Rs-PgpB respectively produced 68.2%, 43.4%, and 21.9% higher FOH titers than that of the control strain. Interestingly, the CoQ<sub>10</sub> production of these 3 recombinant R. sphaeroides strains was exactly opposite to that of FOH. However, CoQ<sub>10</sub> production was almost unaffected in R. sphaeroides strains modified by psy RNA interference. The highest FOH production of 40.45\u00a0mg/L, which was twice as high as that of the control, was obtained from the TPS-PSYi strain, where the exogenous TPS was combined with the weakening of the phytoene synthesis pathway via psy RNA interference. CoQ<sub>10</sub> production in TPS-PSYi, ATPS-PSYi, and PgpB-PSYi was decreased and lower than that of the control strain.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The original flux that contributed to phytoene synthesis was effectively redirected to provide precursors toward FOH or CoQ<sub>10</sub> synthesis via psy RNA interference, which led to weakened carotenoid synthesis. The improved flux that was originally involved in CoQ<sub>10</sub> production and phytoene synthesis was redirected toward FOH synthesis via metabolic modification. This is the first reported instance of FOH and CoQ<sub>10</sub> co-production in R. sphaeroides using a metabolic engineering strategy.", "affiliation": "Engineering Research Center of Industrial

"<h4>Background</h4>Farnesol is an acyclic sesquiterpene alcohol present in the essential oils of various plants in nature. It has been reported to be valuable in medical applications, such as alleviation of allergic asthma, gliosis, and edema as well as anti-cancerous and anti-inflammatory effects. Coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> (CoQ<sub>10</sub>), an essential cofactor in the aerobic respiratory electron transport chain, has attracted growing interest owing to its clinical benefits and important applications in the pharmaceutical, food, and health industries. In this work, co-production of (E,E)-farnesol (FOH) and CoQ<sub>10</sub> was achieved by combining 3 different exogenous terpenes or sesquiterpene synthase with the RNA interference of psy (responsible for phytoene synthesis in Rhodobacter sphaeroides GY-2).<h4>Results</h4>FOH production was significantly increased by overexpressing exogenous terpene synthase (TPS), phosphatidylglycerophosphatase B (PgpB), and sesquiterpene synthase (ATPS), as well as RNAi-mediated silencing of psy coding phytoene synthase (PSY) in R. sphaeroides strains. Rs-TPS, Rs-ATPS, and Rs-PgpB respectively produced 68.2%, 43.4%, and 21.9% higher FOH titers than that of the control strain. Interestingly, the CoQ<sub>10</sub> production of these 3 recombinant R. sphaeroides strains was exactly opposite to that of FOH. However, CoQ<sub>10</sub> production was almost unaffected in R. sphaeroides strains modified by psy RNA interference. The highest FOH production of 40.45\u00a0mg/L, which was twice as high as that of the control, was obtained from the TPS-PSYi strain, where the exogenous TPS was combined with the weakening of the phytoene synthesis pathway via psy RNA interference. CoQ<sub>10</sub> production in TPS-PSYi, ATPS-PSYi, and PgpB-PSYi was decreased and lower than that of the control strain.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The original flux that contributed to phytoene synthesis was effectively redirected to provide precursors toward FOH or CoQ<sub>10</sub> synthesis via psy RNA interference, which led to weakened carotenoid synthesis. The improved flux that was originally involved in CoQ<sub>10</sub> production and phytoene synthesis was redirected toward FOH synthesis via metabolic modification. This is the first reported instance of FOH and CoQ<sub>10</sub> co-production in R. sphaeroides using a metabolic engineering strategy.", "Keywords": ["RNAi", "Farnesol", "CoQ10", "Psy", "Carbon\u00a0flux"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6544981?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Microbial cell factories", "authorinfo": ["Chen X", "Jiang X", "Xu M", "Zhang M", "Huang R", "Huang J", "Qi F"], "title": "Co-production of farnesol and coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> from metabolically engineered Rhodobacter sphaeroides."}, "PMC7299927": {"downloaded": false, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "32306368", "source": "MED", "pmid": "32306368", "pmcid": "PMC7299927", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC7299927"}, "doi": "10.1007/s11103-020-01005-y", "title": "Transcriptional and metabolite analysis reveal a shift in direct and indirect defences in response to spider-mite infestation in cucumber (Cucumis sativus).", "authorString": "He J, Bouwmeester HJ, Dicke M, Kappers IF.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "He J", "firstName": "Jun", "lastName": "He", "initials": "J", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Laboratory of Plant Physiology, Wageningen University and Research, Wageningen, The Netherlands."}}}, {"fullName": "Bouwmeester HJ", "firstName": "Harro J", "lastName": "Bouwmeester", "initials": "HJ", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-0907-2732"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."}}}, {"fullName": "Dicke M", "firstName": "Marcel", "lastName": "Dicke", "initials": "M", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-8565-8896"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Laboratory of Entomology, Wageningen University and Research, Droevendaalsesteeg 1, 6708 PB, Wageningen, The Netherlands."}}}, {"fullName": "Kappers IF", "firstName": "Iris F", "lastName": "Kappers", "initials": "IF", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-3349-3473"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Laboratory of Plant Physiology, Wageningen University and Research, Wageningen, The Netherlands. iris.kappers@wur.nl."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-8565-8896"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-0907-2732"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-3349-3473"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "4-5", "volume": "103", "journalIssueId": "2969288", "dateOfPublication": "2020 Jul", "monthOfPublication": "7", "yearOfPublication": "2020", "printPublicationDate": "2020-07-01", "journal": {"title": "Plant molecular biology", "ISOAbbreviation": "Plant Mol Biol", "medlineAbbreviation": "Plant Mol Biol", "NLMid": "9106343", "ISSN": "0167-4412", "ESSN": "1573-5028"}}, "pubYear": "2020", "pageInfo": "489-505", "abstractText": "<h4>Key message</h4>Cucumber plants adapt their transcriptome and metabolome as result of spider mite infestation with opposite consequences for direct and indirect defences in two genotypes.

It is abundant in juice of some mandarins (e.g. Citrus reticulata Blanco cv. Fortune), however, it is undetectable in others (e.g. C. reticulata Blanco cv. Murcott), We have discovered that the Murcott mandarin Cstps1 gene expression is severely reduced. A previous genetic mapping study using an F1 population of Fortune \u00d7 Murcott found that the segregation of valencene production in fruit exhibited a Mendelian inheritance ratio of 1:1. There was only one dominant locus associated with valencene content detected on the mandarin genetic map. The goal of this study was to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the valencene deficiency observed in some citrus hybrids.<h4>Results</h4>There was a clear relationship between presence or absence of the valencene synthase gene (Cstps1) expression, and presence or absence of valencene among randomly selected mandarin hybrids. Cloning the coding regions of Cstps1 from Fortune and Murcott mandarin, and aligning with previous reported Valencia orange Cstps1 sequence, showed that they both exhibited extremely high similarity with the known Cstps1. By further cloning and analyzing the promoter region of Cstps1 from Valencia, Fortune and Murcott, a 12-nucleotide deletion at approximately -\u2009270\u2009bp from the Cstps1 coding region was only found in Murcott. Three binary vectors, designated as p1380-FortP-GUSin, p1380-MurcP-GUSin and p1380-MurcP(+\u200912)-GUSin, were developed for promoter activity analysis.

It is abundant in juice of some mandarins (e.g. Citrus reticulata Blanco cv. Fortune), however, it is undetectable in others (e.g. C. reticulata Blanco cv. Murcott), We have discovered that the Murcott mandarin Cstps1 gene expression is severely reduced. A previous genetic mapping study using an F1 population of Fortune \u00d7 Murcott found that the segregation of valencene production in fruit exhibited a Mendelian inheritance ratio of 1:1. There was only one dominant locus associated with valencene content detected on the mandarin genetic map. The goal of this study was to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the valencene deficiency observed in some citrus hybrids.<h4>Results</h4>There was a clear relationship between presence or absence of the valencene synthase gene (Cstps1) expression, and presence or absence of valencene among randomly selected mandarin hybrids. Cloning the coding regions of Cstps1 from Fortune and Murcott mandarin, and aligning with previous reported Valencia orange Cstps1 sequence, showed that they both exhibited extremely high similarity with the known Cstps1. By further cloning and analyzing the promoter region of Cstps1 from Valencia, Fortune and Murcott, a 12-nucleotide deletion at approximately -\u2009270\u2009bp from the Cstps1 coding region was only found in Murcott. Three binary vectors, designated as p1380-FortP-GUSin, p1380-MurcP-GUSin and p1380-MurcP(+\u200912)-GUSin, were developed for promoter activity analysis. Transient over-expression of Fortune Cstps1 promoter in sweet orange showed notable GUS activity, but the Murcott Cstps1 promoter did not. In addition, by re-inserting the 12-nucleotide fragment, the activity of the Murcott Cstps1 promoter was mostly recovered.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The deficiency of valencene production in some mandarins is probably due to a 12-nucleotide deletion in the promoter region of the Cstps1, which could be a crucial switch of Cstps1 transcription.

\u03b2-cryptoxanthin, in juice sac tissues of fruits via molecular breeding in citrus, allele mining was utilized to dissect allelic variation of carotenoid metabolic genes and identify an optimum allele on the target loci characterized by expression quantitative trait (eQTL) analysis. SNPs of target carotenoid metabolic genes in 13 founders of the Japanese citrus breeding population were explored using the SureSelect target enrichment method. An independent allele was determined based on the presence or absence of reliable SNPs, using trio analysis to confirm inheritability between parent and offspring. Among the 13 founders, there were 7 PSY alleles, 7 HYb alleles, 11 ZEP alleles, 5 NCED alleles, and 4 alleles for the eQTL that control the transcription levels of PDS and ZDS among the ancestral species, indicating that some founders acquired those alleles from them. The carotenoid composition data of 263 breeding pedigrees in juice sac tissues revealed that the phenotypic variance of carotenoid composition was similar to that in the 13 founders, whereas the mean of total carotenoid content increased. This increase in total carotenoid content correlated with the increase in either or both \u03b2-cryptoxanthin and violaxanthin in juice sac tissues. Bayesian statistical analysis between allelic composition of target genes and carotenoid composition in 263 breeding pedigrees indicated that PSY-a and ZEP-e alleles at PSY and ZEP loci had strong positive effects on increasing the total carotenoid content, including \u03b2-cryptoxanthin and violaxanthin, in juice sac tissues. Moreover, the pyramiding of these alleles also increased the \u03b2-cryptoxanthin content.

SNPs of target carotenoid metabolic genes in 13 founders of the Japanese citrus breeding population were explored using the SureSelect target enrichment method. An independent allele was determined based on the presence or absence of reliable SNPs, using trio analysis to confirm inheritability between parent and offspring. Among the 13 founders, there were 7 PSY alleles, 7 HYb alleles, 11 ZEP alleles, 5 NCED alleles, and 4 alleles for the eQTL that control the transcription levels of PDS and ZDS among the ancestral species, indicating that some founders acquired those alleles from them. The carotenoid composition data of 263 breeding pedigrees in juice sac tissues revealed that the phenotypic variance of carotenoid composition was similar to that in the 13 founders, whereas the mean of total carotenoid content increased. This increase in total carotenoid content correlated with the increase in either or both \u03b2-cryptoxanthin and violaxanthin in juice sac tissues. Bayesian statistical analysis between allelic composition of target genes and carotenoid composition in 263 breeding pedigrees indicated that PSY-a and ZEP-e alleles at PSY and ZEP loci had strong positive effects on increasing the total carotenoid content, including \u03b2-cryptoxanthin and violaxanthin, in juice sac tissues. Moreover, the pyramiding of these alleles also increased the \u03b2-cryptoxanthin content. Interestingly, the offset interaction between the alleles with increasing and decreasing effects on carotenoid content and the epistatic interaction among carotenoid metabolic genes were observed and these interactions complexed carotenoid profiles in breeding population.

RESULTS:Here, de novo transcriptome assembly was performed for the five major organs of Z. armatum, including the roots, stems, leaf buds, mature leaves and fruits.

Additionally, a large number of SSRs were obtained to improve our understanding of the phylogeny and genetics of Z. armatum. The organ-specific unigenes of the five major samples were screened and annotated via GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. A total of 53 and 34 unigenes that were exclusively upregulated in fruit samples were identified as candidate unigenes for terpenoid biosynthesis or fatty acid biosynthesis, elongation and degradation pathways, respectively.

there have been few reports about the volatiles in citrus leaves and flowers. However, citrus leaves and flowers are also rich in volatile compounds with unique aromas. Here, to investigate the volatiles in citrus leaves and flowers, volatile profiling was performed on leaves from 62 germplasms and flowers from 25 germplasms. RESULTS:In total, 196 and 82 volatile compounds were identified from leaves of 62 citrus germplasms and flowers of 25 citrus germplasms, respectively. The dominant volatile terpenoids were more diverse in citrus leaves than in peels. A total of 34 volatile terpenoids were commonly detected in the leaves of at least 20 germplasms, among which 31 were overaccumulated in the leaves of wild or semiwild germplasms. This result was consistent with the high expression levels of five genes and one key gene of the mevalonate and 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) biosynthetic pathways, respectively, as well as the low expression levels of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase of the MEP pathway, relative to the levels in cultivars.

While the formation of volatiles above-ground has been intensively studied, little is known about herbivore-induced root volatiles. Here, we show that cockchafer larvae-damaged roots of Populus trichocarpa and P. nigra release a mixture of monoterpenes, including (-)-\u03b1-pinene, (-)-camphene, (-)-\u03b2-pinene, p-cymene, and 1,8-cineole. Three terpene synthases, PtTPS16 and PtTPS21 from P. trichocarpa and PnTPS4 from P. nigra, could be identified and characterized in vitro. PnTPS4 was found to produce 1,8-cineole as sole product. PtTPS16 and PtTPS21, although highly similar to each other, showed different product specificities and produced \u03b3-terpinene and a mixture of (-)-camphene, (-)-\u03b1-pinene, (-)-\u03b2-pinene, and (-)-limonene, respectively. Four active site residues were found to determine the different product specificities of the two enzymes.

While the formation of volatiles above-ground has been intensively studied, little is known about herbivore-induced root volatiles. Here, we show that cockchafer larvae-damaged roots of Populus trichocarpa and P. nigra release a mixture of monoterpenes, including (-)-\u03b1-pinene, (-)-camphene, (-)-\u03b2-pinene, p-cymene, and 1,8-cineole. Three terpene synthases, PtTPS16 and PtTPS21 from P. trichocarpa and PnTPS4 from P. nigra, could be identified and characterized in vitro. PnTPS4 was found to produce 1,8-cineole as sole product. PtTPS16 and PtTPS21, although highly similar to each other, showed different product specificities and produced \u03b3-terpinene and a mixture of (-)-camphene, (-)-\u03b1-pinene, (-)-\u03b2-pinene, and (-)-limonene, respectively. Four active site residues were found to determine the different product specificities of the two enzymes.

However, volatiles released constitutively may affect herbivores and natural enemies' fitness too. In tomato there is still a lack of information on the genetic bases responsible for the constitutive release of VOC involved in direct and indirect defenses. Here we studied the constitutive emissions related to the two most abundant sesquiterpene synthase genes expressed in tomato and their functional role in plant defense. Using an RNA interference approach, we silenced the expression of <i>TPS9</i> and <i>TPS12</i> genes and assessed the effect of this transformation on herbivores and parasitoids. We found that silenced plants displayed a different constitutive volatiles emission from controls, resulting in reduced attractiveness for the aphid parasitoid <i>Aphidius ervi</i> and in an impaired development of <i>Spodoptera exigua</i> larvae.

Using an RNA interference approach, we silenced the expression of <i>TPS9</i> and <i>TPS12</i> genes and assessed the effect of this transformation on herbivores and parasitoids. We found that silenced plants displayed a different constitutive volatiles emission from controls, resulting in reduced attractiveness for the aphid parasitoid <i>Aphidius ervi</i> and in an impaired development of <i>Spodoptera exigua</i> larvae.

metabolites as pheromones in intraspecific interactions. In contrast to plants and microbes, which employ enzymes called terpene synthases (TPSs) to synthesize terpene metabolites, limited information from few species is available about the enzymatic mechanisms underlying terpene pheromone biosynthesis in insects. Several stink bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), among them severe agricultural pests, release 15-carbon sesquiterpenes with a bisabolene skeleton as sex or aggregation pheromones. The harlequin bug, <i>Murgantia histrionica</i>, a specialist pest of crucifers, uses two stereoisomers of 10,11-epoxy-1-bisabolen-3-ol as a male-released aggregation pheromone called murgantiol. We show that <i>Mh</i>TPS (<i>Mh</i>IDS-1), an enzyme unrelated to plant and microbial TPSs but with similarity to <i>trans</i>-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases (IDS) of the core terpene biosynthetic pathway, catalyzes the formation of (1<i>S</i>,6<i>S</i>,7<i>R</i>)-1,10-bisaboladien-1-ol (sesquipiperitol) as a terpene intermediate in murgantiol biosynthesis. Sesquipiperitol, a so-far-unknown compound in animals, also occurs in plants, indicating convergent evolution in the biosynthesis of this sesquiterpene.

We used a genetic mapping population of wild tobacco, Nicotiana attenuata, originating from a cross of 2 natural accessions from Arizona and Utah, separated by the Grand Canyon, to dissect genetic variation controlling VOCs. Herbivory-induced leaf terpenoid emissions varied substantially, while green leaf volatile emissions were similar.

The number of organ-specific expressed unigenes ranged from 4393 in leaf to 9124 in strobilus, suggesting their special roles in physiological processes, organ development, and adaptability in the different four organs. A total of 16,562 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified among the four organs and clustered into six subclusters.

The sequences were analyzed to predict transcription factors, long non-coding RNAs, and alternative splicing events. The expression levels of most DEGs of C2H2, C3H, bHLH, and bZIP families in the root and stem were higher than those in the leaf and strobilus, indicating that these TFs may play a crucial role in the survival of the root and stem.

The expression levels of most DEGs in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway and plant-pathogen interactions were higher in the root than in the three other organs, suggesting that root constitutes the main organ of defensive compound synthesis and accumulation and has a stronger ability to respond to stress. The sequences were analyzed to predict transcription factors, long non-coding RNAs, and alternative splicing events. The expression levels of most DEGs of C2H2, C3H, bHLH, and bZIP families in the root and stem were higher than those in the leaf and strobilus, indicating that these TFs may play a crucial role in the survival of the root and stem. These results comprise the first comprehensive gene expression profiles obtained for different organs of <i>P. chienii</i>.

The multi-flower spiciform thyrse of lavender not only determines the output of EOs but also reflects an environmental adaption strategy. With the flower development and blossom in turn, the fluctuation of the volatile terpenoids displayed a regular change at each axis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of volatile terpenoids during the process of flowering is poorly understood in lavender. Here, we combine metabolite and RNA-Seq analyses of flowers of five developmental stages at first- and second-axis (FFDSFSA) and initial flower bud (FB0) to discover the active terpenoid biosynthesis as well as flowering-related genes.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 56 mono- and sesquiterpenoids were identified in the EOs of L. angustifolia 'JX-2'. FB0' EO consists of 55 compounds and the two highest compounds, \u03b2-trans-ocimene (20.57%) and (+)-R-limonene (17.00%), can get rid of 74.71 and 78.41% aphids in Y-tube olfactometer experiments, respectively. With sequential and successive blossoms, temporally regulated volatiles were linked to pollinator attraction in field and olfaction bioassays. In three characteristic compounds of FFDSFSA' EOs, linalyl acetate (72.73%) and lavandulyl acetate (72.09%) attracted more bees than linalool (45.35%). Many transcripts related to flowering time and volatile terpenoid metabolism expressed differently during the flower development. Similar metabolic and transcriptomic profiles were observed when florets from the two axes were maintained at the same maturity grade. Besides both compounds and differentially expressed genes were rich in FB0, most volatile compounds were significantly correlated with FB0-specific gene module. Most key regulators related to flowering and terpenoid metabolism were interconnected in the subnetwork of FB0-specific module, suggesting the cross-talk between the two biological processes to some degree.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Characteristic compounds and gene expression profile of FB0 exhibit ecological value in pest control.

Esteya vermicola (Ev) has been reported as a NP fungus with a poorly understood evolutionary history and mechanism of adaptation to parasitism. Furthermore, NP fungal genomic basis of lifestyle was still unclear. We sequenced and annotated the Ev genome (34.2 Mbp) and integrated genetic makeup and evolution of pathogenic genes to investigate NP fungi. The results revealed that NP fungi had some abundant pathogenic genes corresponding to their niche. A number of gene families involved in pathogenicity were expanded, and some pathogenic orthologous genes underwent positive selection. NP fungi with diverse morphological features exhibit similarities of evolutionary convergence in attacking nematodes, but their genetic makeup and microscopic mechanism are different.

by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, is the most devastating disease of rice. In our ongoing characterization of the defence mechanisms of rice plants against M.\u00a0oryzae, a terpene synthase gene OsTPS19 was identified as a candidate defence gene. Here, we report the functional characterization of OsTPS19, which is up-regulated by M.\u00a0oryzae infection. Overexpression of OsTPS19 in rice plants enhanced resistance against M.\u00a0oryzae, while OsTPS19 RNAi lines were more susceptible to the pathogen. Metabolic analysis revealed that the production of a monoterpene (S)-limonene was increased and decreased in OsTPS19 overexpression and RNAi lines, respectively, suggesting that OsTPS19 functions as a limonene synthase in planta. This notion was further supported by in\u00a0vitro enzyme assays with recombinant OsTPS19, in which OsTPS19 had both sesquiterpene activity and monoterpene synthase activity, with limonene as a major product. Furthermore, in a subcellular localization experiment, OsTPS19 was localized in plastids. OsTPS19 has a highly homologous paralog, OsTPS20, which likely resulted from a recent gene duplication event. We found that the variation in OsTPS19 and OsTPS20 enzyme activities was determined by a single amino acid in the active site cavity. The expression of OsTPS20 was not affected by M.\u00a0oryzae infection. This indicates functional divergence of OsTPS19 and OsTPS20. Lastly, (S)-limonene inhibited the germination of M.\u00a0oryzae spores in\u00a0vitro.

However, little is known about the role of terpenoids in response to various adverse environmental stresses as other plants do in the form of signals during plant-environment interactions.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, trace amounts of volatiles consisting of \u03b1-santalene, epi-\u03b2-santalene, \u03b2-santalene, \u03b1-santalol, \u03b2-santalol, (E)-\u03b1-bergamotene, (E)-\u03b2-farnesene and \u03b2-bisabolene were found in the leaves of mature S. album trees. We identified more than 40 candidate terpene synthase (TPS) unigenes by mining publicly-available RNA-seq data and characterized the enzymes encoded by three cDNAs: one mono-TPS catalyzes the formation of mostly \u03b1-terpineol, and two multifunctional sesqui-TPSs, one of which produces (E)-\u03b1-bergamotene and sesquisabinene as major products and another which catalyzes the formation of (E)-\u03b2-farnesene, (E)-nerolidol and (E,E)-farnesol as main products.

Increased activities of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase, were detected in different tissues of S. album plants after applying 1 mM methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and 1 mM salicylic acid (SA), or exposure to 4\u00b0C, 38\u00b0C and high light intensity.

Volatile profiling of nine commercial wine cultivars showed unique cultivar-specific variation in volatile terpenes emitted from grapevine flowers. The flower chemotypes of three divergent cultivars, Muscat of Alexandria, Sauvignon Blanc and Shiraz were subsequently investigated at two flower developmental stages (EL-18 and -26). The cultivars displayed unique flower sesquiterpene compositions that changed during flower organogenesis and the profiles were dominated by either (<i>E</i>)-\u03b2-farnesene, (<i>E,E</i>)-\u03b1-farnesene or (+)-valencene. <i>In silico</i> remapping of microarray probes to <i>VviTPS</i> gene models allowed for a meta-analysis of <i>VviTPS</i> expression patterns in the grape gene atlas to identify genes that could regulate terpene biosynthesis in flowers.

controversial phylogenetic position. Here, we present a chromosome-level assembly of the Litsea cubeba genome, together with low-coverage genomic and transcriptomic data for many other Lauraceae. Phylogenomic analyses show phylogenetic discordance at the position of Magnoliids, suggesting incomplete lineage sorting during the divergence of monocots, eudicots, and Magnoliids. An ancient whole-genome duplication (WGD) event occurred just before the divergence of Laurales and Magnoliales; subsequently, independent WGDs occurred almost simultaneously in the three Lauralean lineages.

"We present reference-quality genome assembly and annotation for the stout camphor tree (Cinnamomum kanehirae (Laurales, Lauraceae)), the first sequenced member of the Magnoliidae comprising four orders (Laurales, Magnoliales, Canellales and Piperales) and over 9,000 species. Phylogenomic analysis of 13 representative seed plant genomes indicates that magnoliid and eudicot lineages share more recent common ancestry than monocots.

One such example is the European grapevine moth Lobesia botrana, a key pest of the grape in the Palearctic region, which recently expanded both its geographical and host plant range. Previous studies have showed that a synthetic blend of the three terpenoids, (E)-\u03b2-caryophyllene, (E)-\u03b2-farnesene and (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT), was as attractive for the moth as the complete grape odour profile in laboratory conditions. The same studies also showed that the specific ratio of these compounds in the grape bouquet was crucial because a percentage variation in any of the three volatiles resulted in almost complete inhibition of the blend's attractiveness. Here, we report on the creation of stable grapevine transgenic lines, with modified (E)-\u03b2-caryophyllene and (E)-\u03b2-farnesene emission and thus with an altered ratio compared to the original plants.

One such example is the European grapevine moth Lobesia botrana, a key pest of the grape in the Palearctic region, which recently expanded both its geographical and host plant range. Previous studies have showed that a synthetic blend of the three terpenoids, (E)-\u03b2-caryophyllene, (E)-\u03b2-farnesene and (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT), was as attractive for the moth as the complete grape odour profile in laboratory conditions. The same studies also showed that the specific ratio of these compounds in the grape bouquet was crucial because a percentage variation in any of the three volatiles resulted in almost complete inhibition of the blend's attractiveness. Here, we report on the creation of stable grapevine transgenic lines, with modified (E)-\u03b2-caryophyllene and (E)-\u03b2-farnesene emission and thus with an altered ratio compared to the original plants. When headspace collections from these plants were tested in wind tunnel behavioural assays, they were less attractive than control extracts.

Aromas produced by scented species are remarkably diverse such as rose, mint, lemon, nutmeg, ginger and many others scents. Amongst odorant species, rose-scented pelargoniums, also named pelargonium rosat, are the most famous hybrids for their production of essential oil (EO), widely used by perfume and cosmetic industries. Although EO composition has been extensively studied, the underlying biosynthetic pathways and their regulation, most notably of terpenes, are largely unknown. To gain a better understanding of the terpene metabolic pathways in pelargonium rosat, we generated a transcriptome dataset of pelargonium leaf and used a candidate gene approach to functionally characterise four terpene synthases (TPSs), including a geraniol synthase, a key enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of the main rose-scented terpenes. We also report for the first time the characterisation of a novel sesquiterpene synthase catalysing the biosynthesis of 10-epi-\u03b3-eudesmol.

Aromas produced by scented species are remarkably diverse such as rose, mint, lemon, nutmeg, ginger and many others scents. Amongst odorant species, rose-scented pelargoniums, also named pelargonium rosat, are the most famous hybrids for their production of essential oil (EO), widely used by perfume and cosmetic industries. Although EO composition has been extensively studied, the underlying biosynthetic pathways and their regulation, most notably of terpenes, are largely unknown. To gain a better understanding of the terpene metabolic pathways in pelargonium rosat, we generated a transcriptome dataset of pelargonium leaf and used a candidate gene approach to functionally characterise four terpene synthases (TPSs), including a geraniol synthase, a key enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of the main rose-scented terpenes. We also report for the first time the characterisation of a novel sesquiterpene synthase catalysing the biosynthesis of 10-epi-\u03b3-eudesmol. We found a strong correlation between expression of the four genes encoding the respective TPSs and accumulation of the corresponding products in several pelargonium cultivars and species.

Recently, a sesquiterpene synthase gene that encodes a 65 kDa protein was isolated from the aromatic plant <i>Persicaria minor</i>. Here, we report the expression, purification and characterization of recombinant <i>P. minor</i> sesquiterpene synthase protein (PmSTS). Insights into the catalytic active site were further provided by structural analysis guided by multiple sequence alignment.<h4>Methods</h4>The enzyme was purified in two steps using affinity and size exclusion chromatography. Enzyme assays were performed using the malachite green assay and enzymatic product was identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Sequence analysis of PmSTS was performed using multiple sequence alignment (MSA) against plant sesquiterpene synthase sequences. The homology model of PmSTS was generated using I-TASSER server.<h4>Results</h4>Our findings suggest that the recombinant PmSTS is mainly expressed as inclusion bodies and soluble aggregate in the <i>E. coli</i> protein expression system. However, the addition of 15% (v/v) glycerol to the protein purification buffer and the removal of N-terminal 24 amino acids of PmSTS helped to produce homogenous recombinant protein. Enzyme assay showed that recombinant PmSTS is active and specific to the C<sub>15</sub> substrate FPP. The optimal temperature and pH for the recombinant PmSTS are 30\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 8.0, respectively. The GC-MS analysis further showed that PmSTS produces <i>\u03b2</i>-sesquiphellandrene as a major product and <i>\u03b2</i>-farnesene as a minor product. MSA analysis revealed that PmSTS adopts a modified conserved metal binding motif (NSE/DTE motif). Structural analysis suggests that PmSTS may binds to its substrate similarly to other plant sesquiterpene synthases.<h4>Discussion</h4>The study has revealed that homogenous PmSTS protein can be obtained with the addition of glycerol in the protein buffer. The N-terminal truncation dramatically improved the homogeneity of PmSTS during protein purification, suggesting that the disordered N-terminal region may have caused the formation of soluble aggregate. We further show that the removal of the N-terminus disordered region of PmSTS does not affect the product specificity.

Recently, a sesquiterpene synthase gene that encodes a 65 kDa protein was isolated from the aromatic plant <i>Persicaria minor</i>. Here, we report the expression, purification and characterization of recombinant <i>P. minor</i> sesquiterpene synthase protein (PmSTS). Insights into the catalytic active site were further provided by structural analysis guided by multiple sequence alignment.<h4>Methods</h4>The enzyme was purified in two steps using affinity and size exclusion chromatography. Enzyme assays were performed using the malachite green assay and enzymatic product was identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Sequence analysis of PmSTS was performed using multiple sequence alignment (MSA) against plant sesquiterpene synthase sequences. The homology model of PmSTS was generated using I-TASSER server.<h4>Results</h4>Our findings suggest that the recombinant PmSTS is mainly expressed as inclusion bodies and soluble aggregate in the <i>E. coli</i> protein expression system. However, the addition of 15% (v/v) glycerol to the protein purification buffer and the removal of N-terminal 24 amino acids of PmSTS helped to produce homogenous recombinant protein. Enzyme assay showed that recombinant PmSTS is active and specific to the C<sub>15</sub> substrate FPP. The optimal temperature and pH for the recombinant PmSTS are 30\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 8.0, respectively. The GC-MS analysis further showed that PmSTS produces <i>\u03b2</i>-sesquiphellandrene as a major product and <i>\u03b2</i>-farnesene as a minor product. MSA analysis revealed that PmSTS adopts a modified conserved metal binding motif (NSE/DTE motif). Structural analysis suggests that PmSTS may binds to its substrate similarly to other plant sesquiterpene synthases.<h4>Discussion</h4>The study has revealed that homogenous PmSTS protein can be obtained with the addition of glycerol in the protein buffer. The N-terminal truncation dramatically improved the homogeneity of PmSTS during protein purification, suggesting that the disordered N-terminal region may have caused the formation of soluble aggregate. We further show that the removal of the N-terminus disordered region of PmSTS does not affect the product specificity. The optimal temperature, optimal pH, <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> and <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> values of PmSTS suggests that PmSTS shares similar enzyme characteristics with other plant sesquiterpene synthases. The discovery of an altered conserved metal binding motif in PmSTS through MSA analysis shows that the NSE/DTE motif commonly found in terpene synthases is able to accommodate certain level of plasticity to accept variant amino acids.

The pivotal enzymes for terpene biosynthesis, terpene synthases (TPSs), had been described only in plants and fungi in the eukaryotic domain. In this report, we systematically analyzed the genome sequences of a broad range of nonplant/nonfungus eukaryotes and identified putative TPS genes in six species of amoebae, five of which are multicellular social amoebae from the order of Dictyosteliida. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that amoebal TPSs are evolutionarily more closely related to fungal TPSs than to bacterial TPSs. The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum was selected for functional study of the identified TPSs. D. discoideum grows as a unicellular organism when food is abundant and switches from vegetative growth to multicellular development upon starvation. We found that expression of most D. discoideum TPS genes was induced during development. Upon heterologous expression, all nine TPSs from D. discoideum showed sesquiterpene synthase activities. Some also exhibited monoterpene and/or diterpene synthase activities.

structurally diverse natural products involved in many ecological interactions. The pivotal enzymes for terpene biosynthesis, terpene synthases (TPSs), had been described only in plants and fungi in the eukaryotic domain. In this report, we systematically analyzed the genome sequences of a broad range of nonplant/nonfungus eukaryotes and identified putative TPS genes in six species of amoebae, five of which are multicellular social amoebae from the order of Dictyosteliida. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that amoebal TPSs are evolutionarily more closely related to fungal TPSs than to bacterial TPSs. The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum was selected for functional study of the identified TPSs. D. discoideum grows as a unicellular organism when food is abundant and switches from vegetative growth to multicellular development upon starvation. We found that expression of most D. discoideum TPS genes was induced during development. Upon heterologous expression, all nine TPSs from D. discoideum showed sesquiterpene synthase activities. Some also exhibited monoterpene and/or diterpene synthase activities. Direct measurement of volatile terpenes in cultures of D. discoideum revealed essentially no emission at an early stage of development. In contrast, a bouquet of terpenes, dominated by sesquiterpenes including \u03b2-barbatene and (E,E)-\u03b1-farnesene, was detected at the middle and late stages of development, suggesting a development-specific function of volatile terpenes in D. discoideum.

Little is known about the regulation of the volatile compound biosynthesis in lily flower scent. Here, we conducted an approach combining two-dimensional analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to explore candidate genes regulating flower scent production. In the approach, changes of flower volatile emissions and corresponding gene expression profiles at four flower developmental stages and four circadian times were both captured by GC-MS and RNA-seq methods. By overlapping differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) that responded to flower scent changes in flower development and circadian rhythm, 3,426 DEGs were initially identified to be candidates for flower scent production, of which 1,270 were predicted as transcriptional factors (TFs). The DEGs were further correlated to individual flower volatiles by WGCNA. Finally, 37, 41 and 90 genes were identified as candidate TFs likely regulating terpenoids, phenylpropanoids and fatty acid derivatives productions, respectively. Moreover, by WGCNA several genes related to auxin, gibberellins and ABC transporter were revealed to be responsible for flower scent production. Thus, this strategy provides an important foundation for future studies on the molecular mechanisms involved in floral scent production.", "affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Development and

popular flower around the world not only because of its elegant appearance, but also due to its appealing scent. Little is known about the regulation of the volatile compound biosynthesis in lily flower scent. Here, we conducted an approach combining two-dimensional analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to explore candidate genes regulating flower scent production. In the approach, changes of flower volatile emissions and corresponding gene expression profiles at four flower developmental stages and four circadian times were both captured by GC-MS and RNA-seq methods. By overlapping differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) that responded to flower scent changes in flower development and circadian rhythm, 3,426 DEGs were initially identified to be candidates for flower scent production, of which 1,270 were predicted as transcriptional factors (TFs). The DEGs were further correlated to individual flower volatiles by WGCNA. Finally, 37, 41 and 90 genes were identified as candidate TFs likely regulating terpenoids, phenylpropanoids and fatty acid derivatives productions, respectively. Moreover, by WGCNA several genes related to auxin, gibberellins and ABC transporter were revealed to be responsible for flower scent production. Thus, this strategy provides an important foundation for future studies on the molecular mechanisms involved in floral scent production.", "pdflinks":

importance as ornamental plants and in the perfume industry. We report the rose whole-genome sequencing and assembly and resequencing of major genotypes that contributed to rose domestication. We generated a homozygous genotype from a heterozygous diploid modern rose progenitor, Rosa chinensis 'Old Blush'. Using single-molecule real-time sequencing and a meta-assembly approach, we obtained one of the most comprehensive plant genomes to date. Diversity analyses highlighted the mosaic origin of 'La France', one of the first hybrids combining the growth vigor of European species and the recurrent blooming of Chinese species.

Two of the four groups contain a canonical aspartate-rich \"DDxxD\" motif. The third group has a \"DDxxxD\" motif, and the fourth group has only the first two \"DD\" conserved in this motif. Upon heterologous expression, representative members from each of the four groups displayed diverse catalytic functions as monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases, suggesting these are important for terpene formation in nonseed plants.", "Keywords": ["Terpene synthase", "Gene evolution", "Specialized Metabolism", "Nonseed Plant"], "journaltitle": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "authorinfo": ["Jia Q", "Li G", "K\u00f6llner TG", "Fu J", "Chen X", "Xiong W", "Crandall-Stotler BJ", "Bowman JL", "Weston DJ", "Zhang Y", "Chen L", "Xie Y", "Li FW", "Rothfels CJ", "Larsson A", "Graham SW", "Stevenson DW", "Wong GK", "Gershenzon J", "Chen F"], "title": "Microbial-type terpene synthase genes occur widely in nonseed land plants, but not in seed plants."}, "PMC6707142": {"downloaded": false, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "31444322", "source": "MED", "pmid": "31444322", "pmcid": "PMC6707142", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC6707142"}, "doi": "10.1038/s41467-019-11290-x", "title": "Orthogonal monoterpenoid biosynthesis in yeast constructed on an isomeric substrate.", "authorString": "Ignea C, Raadam MH, Motawia MS, Makris AM, Vickers CE, Kampranis SC.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Ignea C", "firstName": "Codruta", "lastName": "Ignea", "initials": "C", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-6304-9413"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Biochemical Engineering Group, Plant Biochemistry Section, Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Thorvaldsensvej 40, 1871, Frederiksberg C, Denmark."}, {"affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen, Thorvaldsensvej 40, 1871, Frederiksberg C, Denmark."}]}}, {"fullName": "Raadam MH", "firstName": "Morten H", "lastName": "Raadam", "initials": "MH", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-6796-0079"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Biochemical Engineering Group, Plant Biochemistry Section, Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Thorvaldsensvej 40, 1871, Frederiksberg C, Denmark."}}}, {"fullName": "Motawia MS", "firstName": "Mohammed S", "lastName": "Motawia", "initials": "MS", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-5582-9463"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Biochemical Engineering Group, Plant Biochemistry Section, Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Thorvaldsensvej 40, 1871, Frederiksberg C, Denmark."}}}, {"fullName": "Makris AM", "firstName": "Antonios M", "lastName": "Makris", "initials": "AM", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Institute of Applied Biosciences - Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (INAB-CERTH), 57001, Thermi, Thessaloniki, Greece."}}}, {"fullName": "Vickers CE", "firstName": "Claudia E", "lastName": "Vickers", "initials": "CE", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-0792-050X"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN), University of Queensland, St. Lucia, QLD 4072, Australia."}, {"affiliation": "CSIRO Synthetic Biology Future Science Platform, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), GPO Box 2583, Brisbane, QLD 4001, Australia."}]}}, {"fullName": "Kampranis SC", "firstName": "Sotirios C", "lastName": "Kampranis", "initials": "SC", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-6208-1684"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Biochemical Engineering Group, Plant Biochemistry Section, Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Thorvaldsensvej 40, 1871, Frederiksberg C, Denmark. soka@plen.ku.dk."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-5582-9463"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-6208-1684"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-0792-050X"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-6304-9413"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-6796-0079"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "1", "volume": "10", "journalIssueId": "2844022", "dateOfPublication": "2019 Aug", "monthOfPublication": "8", "yearOfPublication": "2019", "printPublicationDate": "2019-08-01", "journal": {"title": "Nature communications", "ISOAbbreviation": "Nat Commun", "medlineAbbreviation": "Nat Commun", "NLMid": "101528555", "ISSN": "2041-1723", "ESSN": "2041-1723"}}, "pubYear": "2019", "pageInfo": "3799", "abstractText": "Synthetic biology efforts for the production of valuable chemicals are frequently hindered by the structure and regulation of the native metabolic pathways of the chassis.

naturally emitted by plants and plays a major role in atmospheric chemistry. It has been proposed that isoprene synthases (IspS) may readily evolve from other terpene synthases, but this hypothesis has not been experimentally investigated. We isolated and functionally validated in Arabidopsis the first isoprene synthase gene, AdoIspS, from a monocotyledonous species (Arundo donax L., Poaceae). Phylogenetic reconstruction indicates that AdoIspS and dicots isoprene synthases most likely originated by parallel evolution from TPS-b monoterpene synthases. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated invivo the functional and evolutionary relevance of the residues considered diagnostic for IspS function. One of these positions was identified by saturating mutagenesis as a major determinant of substrate specificity in AdoIspS able to cause invivo a dramatic change in total volatile emission from hemi- to monoterpenes and supporting evolution of isoprene synthases from ocimene synthases.

It has been proposed that isoprene synthases (IspS) may readily evolve from other terpene synthases, but this hypothesis has not been experimentally investigated. We isolated and functionally validated in Arabidopsis the first isoprene synthase gene, AdoIspS, from a monocotyledonous species (Arundo donax L., Poaceae). Phylogenetic reconstruction indicates that AdoIspS and dicots isoprene synthases most likely originated by parallel evolution from TPS-b monoterpene synthases. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated invivo the functional and evolutionary relevance of the residues considered diagnostic for IspS function. One of these positions was identified by saturating mutagenesis as a major determinant of substrate specificity in AdoIspS able to cause invivo a dramatic change in total volatile emission from hemi- to monoterpenes and supporting evolution of isoprene synthases from ocimene synthases. The mechanism responsible for IspS neofunctionalization by active site size modulation by a single amino acid mutation demonstrated in this study might be general, as the very same amino acidic position is implicated in the parallel evolution of different short-chain terpene synthases from both angiosperms and gymnosperms.

Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) include terpenoids that play key roles in the attraction of natural enemies. Crosstalk between phytohormonal signalling pathways is well known to affect the regulation of plant defences, including the emission of HIPVs. Thus, simultaneous feeding on the same plant by caterpillars and aphids, can affect the attraction of parasitoids by the plant compared to single insect attack. The role of aphid density in the regulation of HIPV emission by plants under dual attack has not been studied previously.

Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) include terpenoids that play key roles in the attraction of natural enemies. Crosstalk between phytohormonal signalling pathways is well known to affect the regulation of plant defences, including the emission of HIPVs. Thus, simultaneous feeding on the same plant by caterpillars and aphids, can affect the attraction of parasitoids by the plant compared to single insect attack. The role of aphid density in the regulation of HIPV emission by plants under dual attack has not been studied previously. Here, we investigated the attraction of Diadegma semiclausum, a parasitoid of the Diamondback moth Plutella xylostella, to volatiles emitted by Arabidopsis thaliana plants, simultaneously attacked by host caterpillars, and by the non-host aphid Brevicoryne brassicae.

Its role in determining the epiphytic and internal plant metabolome, however, remains to be investigated. We analyzed the Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) profiles of the epiphytic and internal metabolomes of the leaves and flowers of Sambucus nigra with and without external antibiotic treatment application.<h4>Results</h4>The epiphytic metabolism showed a degree of complexity similar to that of the plant organs. The suppression of microbial communities by topical applications of antibiotics had a greater impact on the epiphytic metabolome than on the internal metabolomes of the plant organs, although even the latter changed significantly both in leaves and flowers. The application of antibiotics decreased the concentration of lactate in both epiphytic and organ metabolomes, and the concentrations of citraconic acid, acetyl-CoA, isoleucine, and several secondary compounds such as terpenes and phenols in the epiphytic extracts. The metabolite pyrogallol appeared in the floral epiphytic community only after the treatment. The concentrations of the amino acid precursors of the ketoglutarate-synthesis pathway tended to decrease in the leaves and to increase in the foliar epiphytic extracts.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results suggest that anaerobic and/or facultative anaerobic bacteria were present in high numbers in the phyllosphere and in the apoplasts of S. nigra. The results also show that microbial communities play a significant role in the metabolomes of plant organs and could have more complex and frequent mutualistic, saprophytic, and/or parasitic relationships with internal plant metabolism than currently assumed.", "affiliation": "CSIC, Global Ecology Unit CREAF- CSIC-UAB, Cerdanyola del Vall\u00e8s, Catalonia, 08193, Spain.

is assumed to play a key role in the metabolism of host plants. Its role in determining the epiphytic and internal plant metabolome, however, remains to be investigated. We analyzed the Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) profiles of the epiphytic and internal metabolomes of the leaves and flowers of Sambucus nigra with and without external antibiotic treatment application.<h4>Results</h4>The epiphytic metabolism showed a degree of complexity similar to that of the plant organs. The suppression of microbial communities by topical applications of antibiotics had a greater impact on the epiphytic metabolome than on the internal metabolomes of the plant organs, although even the latter changed significantly both in leaves and flowers. The application of antibiotics decreased the concentration of lactate in both epiphytic and organ metabolomes, and the concentrations of citraconic acid, acetyl-CoA, isoleucine, and several secondary compounds such as terpenes and phenols in the epiphytic extracts. The metabolite pyrogallol appeared in the floral epiphytic community only after the treatment. The concentrations of the amino acid precursors of the ketoglutarate-synthesis pathway tended to decrease in the leaves and to increase in the foliar epiphytic extracts.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results suggest that anaerobic and/or facultative anaerobic bacteria were present in high numbers in the phyllosphere and in the apoplasts of S. nigra. The results also show that microbial communities play a significant role in the metabolomes of plant organs and could have more complex and frequent mutualistic, saprophytic, and/or parasitic relationships with internal plant metabolism than currently assumed.", "Keywords": ["Antibiotics", "Metabolites", "Sambucus Nigra", "Epiphytic And Endophytic Microbiota"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4822282?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "BMC plant biology", "authorinfo": ["Gargallo-Garriga A", "Sardans J", "P\u00e9rez-Trujillo M", "Guenther A", "Llusi\u00e0 J", "Rico L", "Terradas J", "Farr\u00e9-Armengol G", "Filella I", "Parella T", "Pe\u00f1uelas J"], "title": "Shifts in plant foliar and floral metabolomes in response to the suppression of the associated microbiota."}, "PMC5568196": {"downloaded": false, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "28830354", "source": "MED", "pmid": "28830354", "pmcid": "PMC5568196", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC5568196"}, "doi": "10.1186/s12864-017-4043-5", "title": "Identification of QTLs controlling aroma volatiles using a 'Fortune' x 'Murcott' (Citrus reticulata) population.", "authorString": "Yu Y, Bai J, Chen C, Plotto A, Yu Q, Baldwin EA, Gmitter FG.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Yu Y", "firstName": "Yuan", "lastName": "Yu", "initials": "Y", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Citrus Research and Education Center, University of Florida, Lake Alfred, FL, 33850, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Bai J", "firstName": "Jinhe", "lastName": "Bai", "initials": "J", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Horticultural Research Laboratory, ARS, USDA, Fort Pierce, FL, 34945, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Chen C", "firstName": "Chunxian", "lastName": "Chen", "initials": "C", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Southeastern Fruit and Tree Nut Research Laboratory, ARS, USDA, Byron, GA, 31008, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Plotto A", "firstName": "Anne", "lastName": "Plotto", "initials": "A", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Horticultural Research Laboratory, ARS, USDA, Fort Pierce, FL, 34945, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Yu Q", "firstName": "Qibin", "lastName": "Yu", "initials": "Q", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Citrus Research and Education Center, University of Florida, Lake Alfred, FL, 33850, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Baldwin EA", "firstName": "Elizabeth A", "lastName": "Baldwin", "initials": "EA", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Horticultural Research Laboratory, ARS, USDA, Fort Pierce, FL, 34945, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Gmitter FG Jr", "firstName": "Frederick G", "lastName": "Gmitter", "initials": "FG", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Citrus Research and Education Center, University of Florida, Lake Alfred, FL, 33850, USA. fgmitter@ufl.edu."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-5453-2377"}}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "1", "volume": "18", "journalIssueId": "2582314", "dateOfPublication": "2017 Aug", "monthOfPublication": "8", "yearOfPublication": "2017", "printPublicationDate": "2017-08-01", "journal": {"title": "BMC genomics", "ISOAbbreviation": "BMC Genomics", "medlineAbbreviation": "BMC Genomics", "NLMid": "100965258", "ISSN": "1471-2164", "ESSN": "1471-2164"}}, "pubYear": "2017", "pageInfo": "646", "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Flavor is an important attribute of mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco), but flavor improvement via conventional breeding is very challenging largely due to the complexity of the flavor components and traits.

Many endophytic fungi are known to produce a wide spectrum of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with potential energy applications, which have been described as \"mycodiesel\". Many of these mycodiesel hydrocarbons are terpenes, a chemically diverse class of compounds produced by many plants, fungi, and bacteria. Due to their high energy densities, terpenes, such as pinene and bisabolene, are actively being investigated as potential \"drop-in\" biofuels for replacing diesel and aviation fuel.

They fulfill important functions in primary metabolism as essential plant growth hormones and are known to function in secondary metabolism as, for example, phytoalexins. The biosynthesis of labdane-related diterpenes is mediated by the action of class II and class I diterpene synthases. Although terpene synthases have been well investigated in poplar, little is known about diterpene formation in this woody perennial plant species.<h4>Results</h4>The recently sequenced genome of Populus trichocarpa possesses two putative copalyl diphosphate synthase genes (CPS, class II) and two putative kaurene synthase genes (KS, class I), which most likely arose through a genome duplication and a recent tandem gene duplication, respectively. We showed that the CPS-like gene PtTPS17 encodes an ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase (ent-CPS), while the protein encoded by the putative CPS gene PtTPS18 showed no enzymatic activity. The putative kaurene synthases PtTPS19 and PtTPS20 both accepted ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CPP) as substrate. However, despite their high sequence similarity, they produced different diterpene products. While PtTPS19 formed exclusively ent-kaurene, PtTPS20 generated mainly the diterpene alcohol, 16\u03b1-hydroxy-ent-kaurane. Using homology-based structure modeling and site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that one amino acid residue determines the different product specificity of PtTPS19 and PtTPS20. A reciprocal exchange of methionine 607 and threonine 607 in the active sites of PtTPS19 and PtTPS20, respectively, led to a complete interconversion of the enzyme product profiles. Gene expression analysis revealed that the diterpene synthase genes characterized showed organ-specific expression with the highest abundance of PtTPS17 and PtTPS20 transcripts in poplar roots.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The poplar diterpene synthases PtTPS17, PtTPS19, and PtTPS20 contribute to the production of ent-kaurene and 16\u03b1-hydroxy-ent-kaurane in poplar.

Direct Contact-Sorptive Tape Extraction (DC-STE) is a sorption sampling technique employing non adhesive polydimethylsiloxane tapes, which are placed in direct contact with a biologically-active surface. DC-STE coupled to Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) is a non-destructive, high concentration-capacity sampling technique able to detect and allow identification of PVs involved in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Here we investigated the leaf topographical dynamics of herbivory-induced PV (HIPV) produced by Phaseolus lunatus L. (lima bean) in response to herbivory by larvae of the Mediterranean climbing cutworm (Spodoptera littoralis Boisd.) and mechanical wounding by DC-STE-GC-MS.<h4>Results</h4>Time-course experiments on herbivory wounding caused by larvae (HW), mechanical damage by a pattern wheel (MD), and MD combined with the larvae oral secretions (OS) showed that green leaf volatiles (GLVs) [(E)-2-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, 1-octen-3-ol, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, (Z)-3-hexenyl butyrate] were associated with both MD and HW, whereas monoterpenoids [(E)-\u03b2-ocimene], sesquiterpenoids [(E)-nerolidol] and homoterpenes (DMNT and TMTT) were specifically associated with HW. Up-regulation of genes coding for HIPV-related enzymes (Farnesyl Pyrophosphate Synthase, Lipoxygenase, Ocimene Synthase and Terpene Synthase 2) was consistent with HIPV results. GLVs and sesquiterpenoids were produced locally and found to influence their own gene expression in distant tissues, whereas (E)-\u03b2-ocimene, TMTT, and DMNT gene expression was limited to wounded areas.<h4>Conclusions</h4>DC-STE-GC-MS was found to be a reliable method for the topographical evaluation of plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, by revealing the differential distribution of different classes of HIPVs. The main advantages of this technique include: a) in vivo sampling; b) reproducible sampling; c) ease of execution; d) simultaneous assays of different leaf portions, and e) preservation of plant material for further \"omic\" studies.

In this study, we investigated whether CJ could prime defence in maize, Zea mays, against the leafhopper, Cicadulina storeyi, responsible for the transmission of maize streak virus (MSV).

Here, we tested insect responses to plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using a Y-tube olfactometer bioassay.

The bioassay revealed a significant preference by this pest for VOCs from infested seedlings without the CJ pre-treatment. A timed series of VOC collections and bioassays showed that the effect was strongest in the first 22 h of insect infestation, i.e. before the insects had themselves induced a change in VOC emission. Chemical analysis showed that treatment of maize seedlings with CJ, followed by exposure to C. storeyi, led to a significant increase in emission of the defensive sesquiterpenes (E)-(1R,9S)-caryophyllene, (E)-\u03b1-bergamotene, (E)-\u03b2-farnesene and (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene, known to act as herbivore repellents.

The potential biological information stored in essential oil composition data can provide an insight into the silent language of plants, and the roles of these chemical emissions in defense, communication and pollinator attraction. In order to decipher volatile profile patterns from a global perspective, we have developed the ESSential OIL DataBase (EssOilDB), a continually updated, freely available electronic database designed to provide knowledge resource for plant essential oils, that enables one to address a multitude of queries on volatile profiles of native, invasive, normal or stressed plants, across taxonomic clades, geographical locations and several other biotic and abiotic influences. To our knowledge, EssOilDB is the only database in the public domain providing an opportunity for context based scientific research on volatile patterns in plants. EssOilDB presently contains 123\u2009041 essential oil records spanning a century of published reports on volatile profiles, with data from 92 plant taxonomic families, spread across diverse geographical locations all over the globe. We hope that this huge repository of VOCs will facilitate unraveling of the true significance of volatiles in plants, along with creating potential avenues for industrial applications of essential oils. We also illustrate the use of this database in terpene biology and show how EssOilDB can be used to complement data from computational genomics to gain insights into the diversity and variability of terpenoids in the plant kingdom. EssOilDB would serve as a valuable information resource, for students and researchers in plant biology, in the design and discovery of new odor profiles, as well as for entrepreneurs--the potential for generating consumer specific scents being one of the most attractive and interesting topics in the cosmetic industry.

In order to decipher volatile profile patterns from a global perspective, we have developed the ESSential OIL DataBase (EssOilDB), a continually updated, freely available electronic database designed to provide knowledge resource for plant essential oils, that enables one to address a multitude of queries on volatile profiles of native, invasive, normal or stressed plants, across taxonomic clades, geographical locations and several other biotic and abiotic influences. To our knowledge, EssOilDB is the only database in the public domain providing an opportunity for context based scientific research on volatile patterns in plants. EssOilDB presently contains 123\u2009041 essential oil records spanning a century of published reports on volatile profiles, with data from 92 plant taxonomic families, spread across diverse geographical locations all over the globe. We hope that this huge repository of VOCs will facilitate unraveling of the true significance of volatiles in plants, along with creating potential avenues for industrial applications of essential oils. We also illustrate the use of this database in terpene biology and show how EssOilDB can be used to complement data from computational genomics to gain insights into the diversity and variability of terpenoids in the plant kingdom. EssOilDB would serve as a valuable information resource, for students and researchers in plant biology, in the design and discovery of new odor profiles, as well as for entrepreneurs--the potential for generating consumer specific scents being one of the most attractive and interesting topics in the cosmetic industry.

Floral scent is a key component of pollinator attraction, and its chemistry modulates both pollinator behaviour and the formation of plant-pollinator networks. The neotropical orchid genus Gongora exhibits specialized pollinator associations with male orchid bees (Euglossini). Male bees visit orchid flowers to collect volatile chemical compounds that they store in hind-leg pouches to use subsequently during courtship display. Hence, Gongora floral scent compounds simultaneously serve as signalling molecules and pollinator rewards. Furthermore, because floral scent acts as the predominant reproductive isolating barrier among lineages, it has been hypothesized that chemical traits are highly species specific. A comparative analysis of intra- and inter-specific variation of floral scent chemistry was conducted to investigate the evolutionary patterns across the genus. \u2022<h4>Methods</h4>Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to analyse the floral scent of 78 individuals belonging to 28 different species of Gongora from two of the three major lineages sampled across the neotropical region. Multidimensional scaling and indicator value analyses were implemented to investigate the patterns of chemical diversity within and among taxonomic groups at various geographic scales. Additionally, pollinator observations were conducted on a sympatric community of Gongora orchids exhibiting distinct floral scent phenotypes. \u2022<h4>Key results</h4>A total of 83 floral volatiles, mainly terpenes and aromatic compounds, were detected. Many of the identified compounds are common across diverse angiosperm families (e.g. cineole, eugenol, \u03b2-ocimene, \u03b2-pinene and terpinen-4-ol), while others are relatively rare outside euglossine bee-pollinated orchid lineages. Additionally, 29 volatiles were identified that are known to attract and elicit collection behaviour in male bees. Floral scent traits were less variable within species than between species, and the analysis revealed exceptional levels of cryptic diversity. Gongora species were divided into 15 fragrance groups based on shared compounds. Fragrance groups indicate that floral scent variation is not predicted by taxonomic rank or biogeographic region. \u2022<h4>Conclusions</h4>Gongora orchids emit a diverse array of scent molecules that are largely species specific, and closely related taxa exhibit qualitatively and quantitatively divergent chemical profiles.

Floral scent is a key component of pollinator attraction, and its chemistry modulates both pollinator behaviour and the formation of plant-pollinator networks. The neotropical orchid genus Gongora exhibits specialized pollinator associations with male orchid bees (Euglossini). Male bees visit orchid flowers to collect volatile chemical compounds that they store in hind-leg pouches to use subsequently during courtship display. Hence, Gongora floral scent compounds simultaneously serve as signalling molecules and pollinator rewards. Furthermore, because floral scent acts as the predominant reproductive isolating barrier among lineages, it has been hypothesized that chemical traits are highly species specific. A comparative analysis of intra- and inter-specific variation of floral scent chemistry was conducted to investigate the evolutionary patterns across the genus. \u2022<h4>Methods</h4>Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to analyse the floral scent of 78 individuals belonging to 28 different species of Gongora from two of the three major lineages sampled across the neotropical region. Multidimensional scaling and indicator value analyses were implemented to investigate the patterns of chemical diversity within and among taxonomic groups at various geographic scales. Additionally, pollinator observations were conducted on a sympatric community of Gongora orchids exhibiting distinct floral scent phenotypes. \u2022<h4>Key results</h4>A total of 83 floral volatiles, mainly terpenes and aromatic compounds, were detected. Many of the identified compounds are common across diverse angiosperm families (e.g. cineole, eugenol, \u03b2-ocimene, \u03b2-pinene and terpinen-4-ol), while others are relatively rare outside euglossine bee-pollinated orchid lineages. Additionally, 29 volatiles were identified that are known to attract and elicit collection behaviour in male bees. Floral scent traits were less variable within species than between species, and the analysis revealed exceptional levels of cryptic diversity. Gongora species were divided into 15 fragrance groups based on shared compounds. Fragrance groups indicate that floral scent variation is not predicted by taxonomic rank or biogeographic region. \u2022<h4>Conclusions</h4>Gongora orchids emit a diverse array of scent molecules that are largely species specific, and closely related taxa exhibit qualitatively and quantitatively divergent chemical profiles. It is shown that within a community, Gongora scent chemotypes are correlated with near non-overlapping bee pollinator assemblies. The results lend support to the hypothesis that floral scent traits regulate the architecture of bee pollinator associations.

However, studies that shows whether these elicitors originated from salivary glands or from other organs associated with feeding, such as the ventral eversible gland (VEG) are limited. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the secretions from the VEG gland of Spodoptera exigua caterpillars contain elicitors that induce plant defenses by regulating the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other defense-related genes. To test this hypothesis, we quantified and compared the activity of defense-related enzymes, transcript levels of defense-related genes and VOC emission in tomato plants damaged by S. exigua caterpillars with the VEG intact (VEGI) versus plants damaged by caterpillars with the VEG ablated (VEGA).<h4>Results</h4>The quantified defense-related enzymes (i.e. peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and lipoxigenase) were expressed in significantly higher amounts in plants damaged by VEGI caterpillars than in plants damaged by VEGA caterpillars. Similarly, the genes that encode for the key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid and terpene synthase genes that regulate production of terpene VOCs, were up-regulated in plants damaged by VEGI caterpillars.

However, the molecular genetic basis of terpene biosynthesis pathways is virtually unknown. In this study, approximately 6.6 Gb of raw data were generated from the transcriptome of S. officinalis leaves using Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing. After filtering and removing the adapter sequences from the raw data, the number of reads reached 21 million, comprising 98 million of high-quality nucleotide bases. 48,671 unigenes were assembled de novo and annotated for establishing a valid database for studying terpenoid biosynthesis.

Here the analysis of the transcriptome of S. elaeagnifolium is presented, as a means to explore the biology of this species and to identify genes related to its adaptation to environmental stress. One of the basic mechanisms by which plants respond to environmental stress is through the synthesis of specific secondary metabolites that protect the plant from herbivores and microorganisms, or serve as signaling molecules. One important such group of secondary metabolites are terpenes.<h4>Results</h4>By next-generation sequencing, the flower/leaf transcriptome of S. elaeagnifolium was sequenced and de novo assembled into 75,618 unigenes. Among the unigenes identified, several corresponded to genes involved in terpene biosynthesis; these included terpene synthases (TPSs) and genes of the mevalonate (MVA) and the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways. Functional characterization of two of the TPSs showed that one produced the sesquiterpene (E)-caryophyllene and the second produced the monoterpene camphene. Analysis of wounded S. elaeagnifolium leaves has shown significant increase of the concentration of (E)-caryophyllene and geranyl linalool, two terpenes implicated in stress responses. The increased production of (E)-caryophyllene was matched to the induced expression of the corresponding TPS gene. Wounding also led to the increased expression of the putative 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase 2 (DXS2) gene, a key enzyme of the MEP pathway, corroborating the overall increased output of terpene biosynthesis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The reported S. elaeagnifolium de novo transcriptome provides a valuable sequence database that could facilitate study of this invasive weed and contribute to our understanding of the highly diverse Solanaceae family.

"<h4>Background</h4>Solanum elaeagnifolium, an invasive weed of the Solanaceae family, is poorly studied although it poses a significant threat to crops. Here the analysis of the transcriptome of S. elaeagnifolium is presented, as a means to explore the biology of this species and to identify genes related to its adaptation to environmental stress. One of the basic mechanisms by which plants respond to environmental stress is through the synthesis of specific secondary metabolites that protect the plant from herbivores and microorganisms, or serve as signaling molecules. One important such group of secondary metabolites are terpenes.<h4>Results</h4>By next-generation sequencing, the flower/leaf transcriptome of S. elaeagnifolium was sequenced and de novo assembled into 75,618 unigenes. Among the unigenes identified, several corresponded to genes involved in terpene biosynthesis; these included terpene synthases (TPSs) and genes of the mevalonate (MVA) and the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways. Functional characterization of two of the TPSs showed that one produced the sesquiterpene (E)-caryophyllene and the second produced the monoterpene camphene. Analysis of wounded S. elaeagnifolium leaves has shown significant increase of the concentration of (E)-caryophyllene and geranyl linalool, two terpenes implicated in stress responses. The increased production of (E)-caryophyllene was matched to the induced expression of the corresponding TPS gene. Wounding also led to the increased expression of the putative 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase 2 (DXS2) gene, a key enzyme of the MEP pathway, corroborating the overall increased output of terpene biosynthesis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The reported S. elaeagnifolium de novo transcriptome provides a valuable sequence database that could facilitate study of this invasive weed and contribute to our understanding of the highly diverse Solanaceae family.

"pageInfo": "233", "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Tea (Camellia sinensis) has long been consumed worldwide for its amazing flavor and aroma. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA), which acts as an effective elicitor among the plant kingdom, could mostly improve the quality of tea aroma by promoting flavor volatiles in tea leaves. Although a variety of volatile secondary metabolites that contribute to aroma quality have been identified, our understanding of the biosynthetic pathways of these compounds has remained largely incomplete. Therefore, information aboaut the transcriptome of tea leaves and, specifically, details of any changes in gene expression in response to MeJA, is required for a better understanding of the biological mechanisms of MeJA-mediated volatiles biosynthesis. Moreover, MeJA treatment could exaggerate the responses of secondary metabolites and some gene expression which offer a better chance to figure out the mechanism.<h4>Results</h4>The results of two-dimensional gas-chromatograph mass-spectrometry showed that the terpenoids content in MeJA-treated tea leaves increased, especially linalool, geraniol, and phenylethyl alcohol. More importantly, we carried out RNA-seq to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to volatiles biosynthesis pathways induced by MeJA treatment (0\u00a0h, 12\u00a0h, 24\u00a0h and 48\u00a0h) in tea leaves. We identified 19245, 18614, 11890 DEGs respectively in the MeJA_12h, MeJA_24\u00a0h and MeJA_48\u00a0h samples. The \u03b1-Lenolenic acid degradation pathway was firstly responded resulting in activating the JA-pathway inner tea leaves, and the MEP/DOXP pathway significantly exaggerated. Notably, the expression level of jasmonate O-methyltransferase, which is associated with the central JA biosynthesis pathway, was increased by 7.52-fold in MeJA_24\u00a0h tea leaves. Moreover, the genes related to the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway showed different expression patterns compared with the untreated leaves. The expression levels of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-phosphate synthase (DXS), all-trans-nonaprenyl-diphosphate synthase, geranylgeranyl reductase, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (type II), hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase and 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase increased by approximately 2-4-fold.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results of two-dimension gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry analysis suggested that exogenous application of MeJA could induce the levels of volatile components in tea leaves, especially the geraniol, linalool and its oxides.

Methyl jasmonate (MeJA), which acts as an effective elicitor among the plant kingdom, could mostly improve the quality of tea aroma by promoting flavor volatiles in tea leaves. Although a variety of volatile secondary metabolites that contribute to aroma quality have been identified, our understanding of the biosynthetic pathways of these compounds has remained largely incomplete. Therefore, information aboaut the transcriptome of tea leaves and, specifically, details of any changes in gene expression in response to MeJA, is required for a better understanding of the biological mechanisms of MeJA-mediated volatiles biosynthesis. Moreover, MeJA treatment could exaggerate the responses of secondary metabolites and some gene expression which offer a better chance to figure out the mechanism.<h4>Results</h4>The results of two-dimensional gas-chromatograph mass-spectrometry showed that the terpenoids content in MeJA-treated tea leaves increased, especially linalool, geraniol, and phenylethyl alcohol. More importantly, we carried out RNA-seq to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to volatiles biosynthesis pathways induced by MeJA treatment (0\u00a0h, 12\u00a0h, 24\u00a0h and 48\u00a0h) in tea leaves. We identified 19245, 18614, 11890 DEGs respectively in the MeJA_12h, MeJA_24\u00a0h and MeJA_48\u00a0h samples. The \u03b1-Lenolenic acid degradation pathway was firstly responded resulting in activating the JA-pathway inner tea leaves, and the MEP/DOXP pathway significantly exaggerated. Notably, the expression level of jasmonate O-methyltransferase, which is associated with the central JA biosynthesis pathway, was increased by 7.52-fold in MeJA_24\u00a0h tea leaves. Moreover, the genes related to the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway showed different expression patterns compared with the untreated leaves. The expression levels of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-phosphate synthase (DXS), all-trans-nonaprenyl-diphosphate synthase, geranylgeranyl reductase, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (type II), hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase and 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase increased by approximately 2-4-fold.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results of two-dimension gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry analysis suggested that exogenous application of MeJA could induce the levels of volatile components in tea leaves, especially the geraniol, linalool and its oxides. Moreover, the transcriptome analysis showed increased expression of genes in \u03b1-Lenolenic acid degradation pathway which produced massive jasmonic acid and quickly activated holistic JA-pathway inner tea leaves, also the terpenoid backbones biosynthesis pathway was significantly affected after MeJA treatment. In general, MeJA could greatly activate secondary metabolism pathways, especially volatiles.

flowers. Floral scents are a key factor in plant-insect interactions and are vital for successful pollination. C. odorata var. fruticosa, or dwarf ylang ylang, is a variety of ylang ylang that is popularly grown in Southeast Asia as a small shrub with aromatic flowers. Here, we describe the combined use of bioinformatics and chemical analysis to discover genes for the VOC biosynthesis pathways and related genes. The scented flowers of C. odorata var. fruticosa were analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and a total of 49 VOCs were identified at four different stages of flower development. The bulk of these VOCs were terpenes, mainly sesquiterpenes. To identify the various terpene synthases (TPSs) involved in the production of these essential oils, we performed RNA sequencing on mature flowers. From the RNA sequencing data, four full-length TPSs were functionally characterized. In vitro assays showed that two of these TPSs were mono-TPSs. CoTPS1 synthesized four products corresponding to \u03b2-thujene, sabinene, \u03b2-pinene, and \u03b1-terpinene from geranyl pyrophosphate and CoTPS4 produced geraniol from geranyl pyrophosphate.

Floral scents are a key factor in plant-insect interactions and are vital for successful pollination. C. odorata var. fruticosa, or dwarf ylang ylang, is a variety of ylang ylang that is popularly grown in Southeast Asia as a small shrub with aromatic flowers. Here, we describe the combined use of bioinformatics and chemical analysis to discover genes for the VOC biosynthesis pathways and related genes. The scented flowers of C. odorata var. fruticosa were analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and a total of 49 VOCs were identified at four different stages of flower development. The bulk of these VOCs were terpenes, mainly sesquiterpenes. To identify the various terpene synthases (TPSs) involved in the production of these essential oils, we performed RNA sequencing on mature flowers. From the RNA sequencing data, four full-length TPSs were functionally characterized. In vitro assays showed that two of these TPSs were mono-TPSs. CoTPS1 synthesized four products corresponding to \u03b2-thujene, sabinene, \u03b2-pinene, and \u03b1-terpinene from geranyl pyrophosphate and CoTPS4 produced geraniol from geranyl pyrophosphate. The other two TPSs were identified as sesqui-TPSs. CoTPS3 catalysed the conversion of farnesyl pyrophosphate to \u03b1-bergamotene, whereas CoTPS2 was found to be a multifunctional and novel TPS that could catalyse the synthesis of three sesquiterpenes, \u03b2-ylangene, \u03b2-copaene, and \u03b2-cubebene.

Recombinant SaSSy was additionally tested with (Z,Z)-farnesyl diphosphate (Z,Z-FPP) and remarkably, found to produce a mixture of \u03b1-endo-bergamotene, \u03b1-santalene, (Z)-\u03b2-farnesene, epi-\u03b2-santalene, and \u03b2-santalene. Additional cDNAs that encode bisabolene/bisabolol synthases were also cloned and functionally characterized from these three species. Both the santalene synthases and the bisabolene/bisabolol synthases reside in the TPS-b phylogenetic clade, which is more commonly associated with angiosperm monoterpene synthases. An orthologous set of TPS-a synthases responsible for formation of macrocyclic and bicyclic sesquiterpenes were characterized. Strict functionality and limited sequence divergence in the santalene and bisabolene synthases are in contrast to the TPS-a synthases, suggesting these compounds have played a significant role in the evolution of the Santalum genus.", "journaltitle": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "authorinfo": ["Jones CG", "Moniodis J", "Zulak KG", "Scaffidi A", "Plummer JA", "Ghisalberti EL", "Barbour EL", "Bohlmann J"], "title": "Sandalwood fragrance biosynthesis involves sesquiterpene synthases of both the terpene synthase (TPS)-a and TPS-b subfamilies, including santalene synthases."}, "PMC4375501": {"downloaded": false, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "25648891", "source": "MED", "pmid": "25648891", "pmcid": "PMC4375501", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC4375501"}, "doi": "10.1074/jbc.m114.636159", "title": "Identification of a fungal 1,8-cineole synthase from Hypoxylon sp. with specificity determinants in common with the plant synthases.", "authorString": "Shaw JJ, Berbasova T, Sasaki T, Jefferson-George K, Spakowicz DJ, Dunican BF, Portero CE, Narv\u00e1ez-Trujillo A, Strobel SA.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Shaw JJ", "firstName": "Jeffrey J", "lastName": "Shaw", "initials": "JJ", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "From the Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520."}}}, {"fullName": "Berbasova T", "firstName": "Tetyana", "lastName": "Berbasova", "initials": "T", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "From the Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520."}}}, {"fullName": "Sasaki T", "firstName": "Tomoaki", "lastName": "Sasaki", "initials": "T", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "From the Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520."}}}, {"fullName": "Jefferson-George K", "firstName": "Kyra", "lastName": "Jefferson-George", "initials": "K", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, and."}}}, {"fullName": "Spakowicz DJ", "firstName": "Daniel J", "lastName": "Spakowicz", "initials": "DJ", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-2314-6435"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "From the Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520."}}}, {"fullName": "Dunican BF", "firstName": "Brian F", "lastName": "Dunican", "initials": "BF", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "From the Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520."}}}, {"fullName": "Portero CE", "firstName": "Carolina E", "lastName": "Portero", "initials": "CE", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "the Laboratorio de Biotecnolog\u00eda Vegetal, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Ecuador, Quito 17 01 21 84, Ecuador."}}}, {"fullName": "Narv\u00e1ez-Trujillo A", "firstName": "Alexandra", "lastName": "Narv\u00e1ez-Trujillo", "initials": "A", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "the Laboratorio de Biotecnolog\u00eda Vegetal, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Ecuador, Quito 17 01 21 84, Ecuador."}}}, {"fullName": "Strobel SA", "firstName": "Scott A", "lastName": "Strobel", "initials": "SA", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "From the Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, scott.strobel@yale.edu."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-2314-6435"}}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["related_data", "supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "13", "volume": "290", "journalIssueId": "2268233", "dateOfPublication": "2015 Mar", "monthOfPublication": "3", "yearOfPublication": "2015", "printPublicationDate": "2015-03-01", "journal": {"title": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "ISOAbbreviation": "J Biol Chem", "medlineAbbreviation": "J Biol Chem", "NLMid": "2985121R", "ISSN": "0021-9258", "ESSN": "1083-351X"}}, "pubYear": "2015", "pageInfo": "8511-8526", "abstractText": "Terpenes are an important and diverse class of secondary metabolites widely produced by fungi.

Treatments with exogenous MeJA concentrations ranging from mild (0.2 mM) to lethal (50 mM) were used to investigate quantitative relationships among MeJA dose and the kinetics and magnitude of volatile release in Cucumis sativus by combining high-resolution measurements with a proton-transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS) and GC-MS. The results highlighted biphasic kinetics of elicitation of volatiles. The early phase, peaking in 0.1-1 h after the MeJA treatment, was characterized by emissions of lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway volatiles and methanol. In the subsequent phase, starting in 6-12 h and reaching a maximum in 15-25 h after the treatment, secondary emissions of LOX compounds as well as emissions of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were elicited.

These hypotheses have often been tested by transforming plants with sesquiterpene synthases expressed behind the constitutively active 35S promoter, which may have physiological costs measured as inhibited growth and reduced reproduction or may require augmentation of substrate pools to achieve enhanced emission, complicating the interpretation of data from affected transgenic lines. Here, we expressed maize (Zea mays) terpene synthase10 (ZmTPS10), which produces (E)-\u03b1-bergamotene and (E)-\u03b2-farnesene, or a point mutant ZmTPS10M, which produces primarily (E)-\u03b2-farnesene, under control of the 35S promoter in the ecological model plant Nicotiana attenuata. Transgenic N. attenuata plants had specifically enhanced emission of target sesquiterpene(s) with no changes detected in their emission of any other volatiles. Treatment with herbivore or jasmonate elicitors induces emission of (E)-\u03b1-bergamotene in wild-type plants and also tended to increase emission of (E)-\u03b1-bergamotene and (E)-\u03b2-farnesene in transgenics. However, transgenics did not differ from the wild type in defense signaling or chemistry and did not alter defense chemistry in neighboring wild-type plants.

These hypotheses have often been tested by transforming plants with sesquiterpene synthases expressed behind the constitutively active 35S promoter, which may have physiological costs measured as inhibited growth and reduced reproduction or may require augmentation of substrate pools to achieve enhanced emission, complicating the interpretation of data from affected transgenic lines. Here, we expressed maize (Zea mays) terpene synthase10 (ZmTPS10), which produces (E)-\u03b1-bergamotene and (E)-\u03b2-farnesene, or a point mutant ZmTPS10M, which produces primarily (E)-\u03b2-farnesene, under control of the 35S promoter in the ecological model plant Nicotiana attenuata. Transgenic N. attenuata plants had specifically enhanced emission of target sesquiterpene(s) with no changes detected in their emission of any other volatiles. Treatment with herbivore or jasmonate elicitors induces emission of (E)-\u03b1-bergamotene in wild-type plants and also tended to increase emission of (E)-\u03b1-bergamotene and (E)-\u03b2-farnesene in transgenics. However, transgenics did not differ from the wild type in defense signaling or chemistry and did not alter defense chemistry in neighboring wild-type plants. These data are inconsistent with within-plant and between-plant signaling functions of (E)-\u03b2-farnesene and (E)-\u03b1-bergamotene in N. attenuata.

However, in common with many commercial cut flowers, virtually all the commercial Alstroemeria hybrids are not scented. The cultivar 'Sweet Laura' is one of very few scented commercial Alstroemeria hybrids. Characterization of the volatile emission profile of these cut flowers revealed three major terpene compounds: (E)-caryophyllene, humulene (also known as \u03b1-caryophyllene), an ocimene-like compound, and several minor peaks, one of which was identified as myrcene. The profile is completely different from that of the parental scented species A. caryophyllaea. Volatile emission peaked at anthesis in both scented genotypes, coincident in cv. 'Sweet Laura' with the maximal expression of a putative terpene synthase gene AlstroTPS. This gene was preferentially expressed in floral tissues of both cv. 'Sweet Laura' and A. caryophyllaea. Characterization of the AlstroTPS gene structure from cv. 'Sweet Laura' placed it as a member of the class III terpene synthases, and the predicted 567 amino acid sequence placed it into the subfamily TPS-b. The conserved sequences R(28)(R)X(8)W and D(321)DXXD are the putative Mg(2+)-binding sites, and in vitro assay of AlstroTPS expressed in Escherichia coli revealed that the encoded enzyme possesses myrcene synthase activity, consistent with a role for AlstroTPS in scent production in Alstroemeria cv.

However, in common with many commercial cut flowers, virtually all the commercial Alstroemeria hybrids are not scented. The cultivar 'Sweet Laura' is one of very few scented commercial Alstroemeria hybrids. Characterization of the volatile emission profile of these cut flowers revealed three major terpene compounds: (E)-caryophyllene, humulene (also known as \u03b1-caryophyllene), an ocimene-like compound, and several minor peaks, one of which was identified as myrcene. The profile is completely different from that of the parental scented species A. caryophyllaea. Volatile emission peaked at anthesis in both scented genotypes, coincident in cv. 'Sweet Laura' with the maximal expression of a putative terpene synthase gene AlstroTPS. This gene was preferentially expressed in floral tissues of both cv. 'Sweet Laura' and A. caryophyllaea. Characterization of the AlstroTPS gene structure from cv. 'Sweet Laura' placed it as a member of the class III terpene synthases, and the predicted 567 amino acid sequence placed it into the subfamily TPS-b. The conserved sequences R(28)(R)X(8)W and D(321)DXXD are the putative Mg(2+)-binding sites, and in vitro assay of AlstroTPS expressed in Escherichia coli revealed that the encoded enzyme possesses myrcene synthase activity, consistent with a role for AlstroTPS in scent production in Alstroemeria cv.

To date, the molecular mechanisms involved in grapevine berries response to high temperatures are poorly understood. Unlike recent data that addressed the effects on berry development of elevated temperatures applied at the whole plant level, the present work particularly focuses on the fruit responses triggered by direct exposure to heat treatment (HT). In the context of climate change, this work focusing on temperature effect at the microclimate level is of particular interest as it can help to better understand the consequences of leaf removal (a common viticultural practice) on berry development. HT (+ 8\u00b0C) was locally applied to clusters from Cabernet Sauvignon fruiting cuttings at three different developmental stages (middle green, veraison and middle ripening). Samples were collected 1, 7, and 14 days after treatment and used for metabolic and transcriptomic analyses. The results showed dramatic and specific biochemical and transcriptomic changes in heat exposed berries, depending on the developmental stage and the stress duration. When applied at the herbaceous stage, HT delayed the onset of veraison. Heating also strongly altered the berry concentration of amino acids and organic acids (e.g., phenylalanine, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid and malate) and decreased the anthocyanin content at maturity. These physiological alterations could be partly explained by the deep remodeling of transcriptome in heated berries. More than 7000 genes were deregulated in at least one of the nine experimental conditions. The most affected processes belong to the categories \"stress responses,\" \"protein metabolism\" and \"secondary metabolism,\" highlighting the intrinsic capacity of grape berries to perceive HT and to build adaptive responses. Additionally, important changes in processes related to \"transport,\" \"hormone\" and \"cell wall\" might contribute to the postponing of veraison.

The profile of monoterpenes produced by PHS1 is identical with the monoterpenes found in type VI glands. PHS1 and NDPS1 map to chromosome 8, and the presence of a segment of chromosome 8 derived from Solanum pennellii LA0716 causes conversion from the M82 gland monoterpene pattern to that characteristic of LA0716 plants.

(NDPS1), that is expressed in cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) cultivar M82 type VI glandular trichomes and encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of neryl diphosphate from isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate. mRNA for a terpene synthase gene, phellandrene synthase 1 (PHS1), was also identified in these glands. It encodes an enzyme that uses neryl diphosphate to produce beta-phellandrene as the major product as well as a variety of other monoterpenes. The profile of monoterpenes produced by PHS1 is identical with the monoterpenes found in type VI glands. PHS1 and NDPS1 map to chromosome 8, and the presence of a segment of chromosome 8 derived from Solanum pennellii LA0716 causes conversion from the M82 gland monoterpene pattern to that characteristic of LA0716 plants. The data indicate that, contrary to the textbook view of geranyl diphosphate as the \"universal\" substrate of monoterpene synthases, in tomato glands neryl diphosphate serves as a precursor for the synthesis of monoterpenes.", "journaltitle": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "authorinfo": ["Schilmiller AL", "Schauvinhold I", "Larson M", "Xu R", "Charbonneau AL", "Schmidt A", "Wilkerson C", "Last RL", "Pichersky E"], "title": "Monoterpenes in the glandular trichomes of tomato are synthesized from a neryl diphosphate precursor rather than geranyl diphosphate."}, "PMC3195254": {"downloaded": false, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "21952217", "source": "MED", "pmid": "21952217", "pmcid": "PMC3195254", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC3195254"}, "doi": "10.1038/ncomms1494", "title": "Identification and microbial production of a terpene-based advanced biofuel.", "authorString": "Peralta-Yahya PP, Ouellet M, Chan R, Mukhopadhyay A, Keasling JD, Lee TS.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Peralta-Yahya PP", "firstName": "Pamela P", "lastName": "Peralta-Yahya", "initials": "PP", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Joint BioEnergy Institute, 5885 Hollis Avenue, Emeryville, California 94608, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Ouellet M", "firstName": "Mario", "lastName": "Ouellet", "initials": "M"}, {"fullName": "Chan R", "firstName": "Rossana", "lastName": "Chan", "initials": "R"}, {"fullName": "Mukhopadhyay A", "firstName": "Aindrila", "lastName": "Mukhopadhyay", "initials": "A"}, {"fullName": "Keasling JD", "firstName": "Jay D", "lastName": "Keasling", "initials": "JD", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-4170-6088"}}, {"fullName": "Lee TS", "firstName": "Taek Soon", "lastName": "Lee", "initials": "TS"}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-4170-6088"}}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["recommended_reviews", "related_data", "supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"volume": "2", "journalIssueId": "2470138", "dateOfPublication": "2011 Sep", "monthOfPublication": "9", "yearOfPublication": "2011", "printPublicationDate": "2011-09-01", "journal": {"title": "Nature communications", "ISOAbbreviation": "Nat Commun", "medlineAbbreviation": "Nat Commun", "NLMid": "101528555", "ISSN": "2041-1723", "ESSN": "2041-1723"}}, "pubYear": "2011", "pageInfo": "483", "abstractText": "Rising petroleum costs, trade imbalances and environmental concerns have stimulated efforts to advance the microbial production of fuels from lignocellulosic biomass.

Defence of pines against MPB and associated fungal pathogens, as well as other pests, involves oleoresin monoterpenes, which are biosynthesized by families of terpene synthases (TPSs). Volatile monoterpenes also serve as host recognition cues for MPB and as precursors for MPB pheromones. The genes responsible for terpene biosynthesis in jack pine and lodgepole pine were previously unknown.<h4>Results</h4>We report the generation and quality assessment of assembled transcriptome resources for lodgepole pine and jack pine using Sanger, Roche 454, and Illumina sequencing technologies. Assemblies revealed transcripts for approximately 20,000 - 30,000 genes from each species and assembly analyses led to the identification of candidate full-length prenyl transferase, TPS, and P450 genes of oleoresin biosynthesis.

Defence of pines against MPB and associated fungal pathogens, as well as other pests, involves oleoresin monoterpenes, which are biosynthesized by families of terpene synthases (TPSs). Volatile monoterpenes also serve as host recognition cues for MPB and as precursors for MPB pheromones. The genes responsible for terpene biosynthesis in jack pine and lodgepole pine were previously unknown.<h4>Results</h4>We report the generation and quality assessment of assembled transcriptome resources for lodgepole pine and jack pine using Sanger, Roche 454, and Illumina sequencing technologies. Assemblies revealed transcripts for approximately 20,000 - 30,000 genes from each species and assembly analyses led to the identification of candidate full-length prenyl transferase, TPS, and P450 genes of oleoresin biosynthesis. We cloned and functionally characterized, via expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli, nine different jack pine and eight different lodgepole pine mono-TPSs. The newly identified lodgepole pine and jack pine mono-TPSs include (+)-\u03b1-pinene synthases, (-)-\u03b1-pinene synthases, (-)-\u03b2-pinene synthases, (+)-3-carene synthases, and (-)-\u03b2-phellandrene synthases from each of the two species.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In the absence of genome sequences, transcriptome assemblies are important for defence gene discovery in lodgepole pine and jack pine, as demonstrated here for the terpenoid pathway genes.

However, no sesquiterpene synthases, the enzymes involved in construction of the basic carbon skeleton, have been identified in insects to date. We investigated the biosynthesis of the sesquiterpene (6R,7S)-himachala-9,11-diene in the crucifer flea beetle Phyllotreta striolata, a compound previously identified as a male-produced aggregation pheromone in several Phyllotreta species. A (6R,7S)-himachala-9,11-diene-producing sesquiterpene synthase activity was detected in crude beetle protein extracts, but only when (Z,E)-farnesyl diphosphate [(Z,E)-FPP] was offered as a substrate. No sequences resembling sesquiterpene synthases from plants, fungi, or bacteria were found in the P. striolata transcriptome, but we identified nine divergent putative trans-isoprenyl diphosphate synthase (trans-IDS) transcripts. Four of these putative trans-IDSs exhibited terpene synthase (TPS) activity when heterologously expressed. Recombinant PsTPS1 converted (Z,E)-FPP to (6R,7S)-himachala-9,11-diene and other sesquiterpenes observed in beetle extracts. RNAi-mediated knockdown of PsTPS1 mRNA in P. striolata males led to reduced emission of aggregation pheromone, confirming a significant role of PsTPS1 in pheromone biosynthesis. Two expressed enzymes showed genuine IDS activity, with PsIDS1 synthesizing (E,E)-FPP, whereas PsIDS3 produced neryl diphosphate, (Z,Z)-FPP, and (Z,E)-FPP.

However, no sesquiterpene synthases, the enzymes involved in construction of the basic carbon skeleton, have been identified in insects to date. We investigated the biosynthesis of the sesquiterpene (6R,7S)-himachala-9,11-diene in the crucifer flea beetle Phyllotreta striolata, a compound previously identified as a male-produced aggregation pheromone in several Phyllotreta species. A (6R,7S)-himachala-9,11-diene-producing sesquiterpene synthase activity was detected in crude beetle protein extracts, but only when (Z,E)-farnesyl diphosphate [(Z,E)-FPP] was offered as a substrate. No sequences resembling sesquiterpene synthases from plants, fungi, or bacteria were found in the P. striolata transcriptome, but we identified nine divergent putative trans-isoprenyl diphosphate synthase (trans-IDS) transcripts. Four of these putative trans-IDSs exhibited terpene synthase (TPS) activity when heterologously expressed. Recombinant PsTPS1 converted (Z,E)-FPP to (6R,7S)-himachala-9,11-diene and other sesquiterpenes observed in beetle extracts. RNAi-mediated knockdown of PsTPS1 mRNA in P. striolata males led to reduced emission of aggregation pheromone, confirming a significant role of PsTPS1 in pheromone biosynthesis. Two expressed enzymes showed genuine IDS activity, with PsIDS1 synthesizing (E,E)-FPP, whereas PsIDS3 produced neryl diphosphate, (Z,Z)-FPP, and (Z,E)-FPP. In a phylogenetic analysis, the PsTPS enzymes and PsIDS3 were clearly separated from a clade of known coleopteran trans-IDS enzymes including PsIDS1 and PsIDS2.

Even for the same variety, terpene profile can be substantially different for grapevine growing environments. Recently a series of genes required for terpene biosynthesis were biochemically characterized in grape berries. However, the genes that dominate the differential terpene accumulation of grape berries between regions have yet to be identified.<h4>Methods</h4>Free and glycosidically-bound terpenes were identified and quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique. The transcription expression profiling of the genes was obtained by RNA sequencing and part of the results were verified by quantitative real time PCR (QPCR). The gene co-expression networks were constructed with the Cytoscape software v 2.8.2 ( www.cytoscape.org).<h4>Results</h4>'Muscat Blanc a Petits Grains' berries were collected from two wine-producing regions with strikingly different climates, Gaotai (GT) in Gansu Province and Changli (CL) in Hebei Province in China, at four developmental stages for two consecutive years. GC-MS analysis demonstrated that both free and glycosidically bound terpenes accumulated primarily after veraison and that mature grape berries from CL contained significantly higher concentrations of free and glycosidically bound terpenes than berries from GT. Transcriptome analysis revealed that some key genes involved in terpene biosynthesis were markedly up-regulated in the CL region. Particularly in the MEP pathway, the expression of VviHDR (1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase) paralleled with the accumulation of terpenes, which can promote the flow of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) into the terpene synthetic pathway. The glycosidically bound monoterpenes accumulated differentially along with maturation in both regions, which is synchronous with the expression of a monoterpene glucosyltransferase gene (VviUGT85A2L4 (VviGT14)). Other genes were also found to be related to the differential accumulation of terpenes and monoterpene glycosides in the grapes between regions. Transcription factors that could regulate terpene synthesis were predicted through gene co-expression network analysis. Additionally, the genes involved in abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene signal responses were expressed at high levels earlier in GT grapes than in CL grapes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Differential production of free and glycosidically-bound terpenes in grape berries across GT and CL regions should be related at least to the expression of both VviHDR and VviUGT85A2L4 (VviGT14).

Considering the expression patterns of both transcription factors and mature-related genes, we infer that less rainfall and stronger sunshine in the GT region could initiate the earlier expression of ripening-related genes and accelerate the berry maturation, eventually limiting the production of terpene volatiles.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4595271?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "BMC plant biology", "authorinfo": ["Wen YQ", "Zhong GY", "Gao Y", "Lan YB", "Duan CQ", "Pan QH"], "title": "Using the combined analysis of transcripts and metabolites to propose key genes for differential terpene accumulation across two regions."}, "PMC4472261": {"downloaded": false, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "26084652", "source": "MED", "pmid": "26084652", "pmcid": "PMC4472261", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC4472261"}, "doi": "10.1186/s12864-015-1653-7", "title": "Transcriptome profiling provides new insights into the formation of floral scent in Hedychium coronarium.", "authorString": "Yue Y, Yu R, Fan Y.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Yue Y", "firstName": "Yuechong", "lastName": "Yue", "initials": "Y", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "The Research Center for Ornamental Plants, College of Forestry and Landscape Architecture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China. yueyuechong@stu.scau.edu.cn."}}}, {"fullName": "Yu R", "firstName": "Rangcai", "lastName": "Yu", "initials": "R", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China. rcyu@scau.edu.cn."}}}, {"fullName": "Fan Y", "firstName": "Yanping", "lastName": "Fan", "initials": "Y", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "The Research Center for Ornamental Plants, College of Forestry and Landscape Architecture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China. fanyanping@scau.edu.cn."}}}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"volume": "16", "journalIssueId": "2476020", "dateOfPublication": "2015 Jun", "monthOfPublication": "6", "yearOfPublication": "2015", "printPublicationDate": "2015-06-01", "journal": {"title": "BMC genomics", "ISOAbbreviation": "BMC Genomics", "medlineAbbreviation": "BMC Genomics", "NLMid": "100965258", "ISSN": "1471-2164", "ESSN": "1471-2164"}}, "pubYear": "2015", "pageInfo": "470", "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Hedychium coronarium is a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions because its flowers not only possess intense and inviting fragrance but also enjoy elegant shape.

To gain insight into this problem, we have compared differences in floral and vegetative volatiles between two closely related plant species with different life histories. The self-pollinating annual, Arabidopsis thaliana, and its relative, the outcrossing perennial, Arabidopsis lyrata, have markedly divergent life cycles and breeding systems. We show that these differences are in part reflected in the formation of distinct volatile mixtures in flowers and foliage. Volatiles emitted from flowers of a German A. lyrata ssp. petraea population are dominated by benzenoid compounds in contrast to the previously described sesquiterpene-dominated emissions of A. thaliana flowers. Flowers of A. lyrata ssp. petraea release benzenoid volatiles in a diurnal rhythm with highest emission rates at midday coinciding with observed visitations of pollinating insects. Insect feeding on leaves of A. lyrata ssp. petraea causes a variable release of the volatiles methyl salicylate, C11- and C16-homoterpenes, nerolidol, plus the sesquiterpene (E)-beta-caryophyllene, which in A. thaliana is emitted exclusively from flowers. An insect-induced gene (AlCarS) with high sequence similarity to the florally expressed (E)-beta-caryophyllene synthase (AtTPS21) from A. thaliana was identified from individuals of a German A. lyrata ssp. petraea population. Recombinant AlCarS converts the sesquiterpene precursor, farnesyl diphosphate, into (E)-beta-caryophyllene with alpha-humulene and alpha-copaene as minor products indicating its close functional relationship to the A. thaliana AtTPS21. Differential regulation of these genes in flowers and foliage is consistent with the different functions of volatiles in the two Arabidopsis species.", "affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for

about the biological functions of most of these substances. To gain insight into this problem, we have compared differences in floral and vegetative volatiles between two closely related plant species with different life histories. The self-pollinating annual, Arabidopsis thaliana, and its relative, the outcrossing perennial, Arabidopsis lyrata, have markedly divergent life cycles and breeding systems. We show that these differences are in part reflected in the formation of distinct volatile mixtures in flowers and foliage. Volatiles emitted from flowers of a German A. lyrata ssp. petraea population are dominated by benzenoid compounds in contrast to the previously described sesquiterpene-dominated emissions of A. thaliana flowers. Flowers of A. lyrata ssp. petraea release benzenoid volatiles in a diurnal rhythm with highest emission rates at midday coinciding with observed visitations of pollinating insects. Insect feeding on leaves of A. lyrata ssp. petraea causes a variable release of the volatiles methyl salicylate, C11- and C16-homoterpenes, nerolidol, plus the sesquiterpene (E)-beta-caryophyllene, which in A. thaliana is emitted exclusively from flowers. An insect-induced gene (AlCarS) with high sequence similarity to the florally expressed (E)-beta-caryophyllene synthase (AtTPS21) from A. thaliana was identified from individuals of a German A. lyrata ssp. petraea population. Recombinant AlCarS converts the sesquiterpene precursor, farnesyl diphosphate, into (E)-beta-caryophyllene with alpha-humulene and alpha-copaene as minor products indicating its close functional relationship to the A. thaliana AtTPS21. Differential regulation of these genes in flowers and foliage is consistent with the different functions of volatiles in the two Arabidopsis species.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2687518?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Planta", "authorinfo": ["Abel C", "Clauss M", "Schaub A", "Gershenzon J", "Tholl D"], "title": "Floral and insect-induced volatile formation in Arabidopsis lyrata ssp. petraea, a perennial, outcrossing relative of A. thaliana."}, "PMC3466413": {"downloaded": false, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "22563774", "source": "MED", "pmid": "22563774", "pmcid": "PMC3466413", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC3466413"}, "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-313x.2012.05040.x", "title": "Evolution of TPS20-related terpene synthases influences chemical diversity in the glandular trichomes of the wild tomato relative Solanum habrochaites.", "authorString": "Gonzales-Vigil E, Hufnagel DE, Kim J, Last RL, Barry CS.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Gonzales-Vigil E", "firstName": "Eliana", "lastName": "Gonzales-Vigil", "initials": "E", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-8267-9285"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Horticulture, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Hufnagel DE", "firstName": "David E", "lastName": "Hufnagel", "initials": "DE", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-6221-2493"}}, {"fullName": "Kim J", "firstName": "Jeongwoon", "lastName": "Kim", "initials": "J"}, {"fullName": "Last RL", "firstName": "Robert L", "lastName": "Last", "initials": "RL", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-6974-9587"}}, {"fullName": "Barry CS", "firstName": "Cornelius S", "lastName": "Barry", "initials": "CS", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-4685-0273"}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-6974-9587"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-6221-2493"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-8267-9285"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-4685-0273"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["related_data", "supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "6", "volume": "71", "journalIssueId": "1965530", "dateOfPublication": "2012 Sep", "monthOfPublication": "9", "yearOfPublication": "2012", "printPublicationDate": "2012-09-01", "journal": {"title": "The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology", "ISOAbbreviation": "Plant J", "medlineAbbreviation": "Plant J", "NLMid": "9207397", "ISSN": "0960-7412", "ESSN": "1365-313X"}}, "pubYear": "2012", "pageInfo": "921-935", "abstractText": "A systematic screen of volatile terpene production in the glandular trichomes of 79 accessions of Solanum habrochaites was conducted and revealed the presence of 21 mono- and sesquiterpenes that exhibit a range of qualitative and quantitative variation.

The tertiary sesquiterpene alcohol (E)-nerolidol was the major emitted volatile detected by headspace analysis. Contrastingly, in solvent extracts of the flowers, unusually high amounts of (E,E)-farnesol were observed, as well as lesser amounts of (E)-nerolidol, various farnesol and farnesal isomers, and linalool. Using a genomics-based approach, a single gene (AcNES1) was identified in an A. chinensis expressed sequence tag library that had significant homology to known floral terpene synthase enzymes. In vitro characterization of recombinant AcNES1 revealed it was an enzyme that could catalyse the conversion of FDP and GDP to the respective (E)-nerolidol and linalool terpene alcohols. Enantiomeric analysis of both AcNES1 products in vitro and floral terpenes in planta showed that (S)-(E)-nerolidol was the predominant enantiomer. Real-time PCR analysis indicated peak expression of AcNES1 correlated with peak (E)-nerolidol, but not linalool accumulation in flowers. This result, together with subcellular protein localization to the cytoplasm, indicated that AcNES1 was acting as a (S)-(E)-nerolidol synthase in A. chinensis flowers. The synthesis of high (E,E)-farnesol levels appears to compete for the available pool of FDP utilized by AcNES1 for sesquiterpene biosynthesis and hence strongly influences the accumulation and

kiwifruit species Actinidia chinensis produce a mixture of sesquiterpenes derived from farnesyl diphosphate (FDP) and monoterpenes derived from geranyl diphosphate (GDP). The tertiary sesquiterpene alcohol (E)-nerolidol was the major emitted volatile detected by headspace analysis. Contrastingly, in solvent extracts of the flowers, unusually high amounts of (E,E)-farnesol were observed, as well as lesser amounts of (E)-nerolidol, various farnesol and farnesal isomers, and linalool. Using a genomics-based approach, a single gene (AcNES1) was identified in an A. chinensis expressed sequence tag library that had significant homology to known floral terpene synthase enzymes. In vitro characterization of recombinant AcNES1 revealed it was an enzyme that could catalyse the conversion of FDP and GDP to the respective (E)-nerolidol and linalool terpene alcohols. Enantiomeric analysis of both AcNES1 products in vitro and floral terpenes in planta showed that (S)-(E)-nerolidol was the predominant enantiomer. Real-time PCR analysis indicated peak expression of AcNES1 correlated with peak (E)-nerolidol, but not linalool accumulation in flowers. This result, together with subcellular protein localization to the cytoplasm, indicated that AcNES1 was acting as a (S)-(E)-nerolidol synthase in A. chinensis flowers. The synthesis of high (E,E)-farnesol levels appears to compete for the available pool of FDP utilized by AcNES1 for sesquiterpene biosynthesis and hence strongly influences the accumulation and emission of (E)-nerolidol in A. chinensis flowers.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3295389?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Journal of experimental botany", "authorinfo": ["Green SA", "Chen X", "Nieuwenhuizen NJ", "Matich AJ", "Wang MY", "Bunn BJ", "Yauk YK", "Atkinson RG"], "title": "Identification, functional characterization, and regulation of the enzyme responsible for floral (E)-nerolidol biosynthesis in kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis)."}, "PMC2659225": {"downloaded": false, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "19181671", "source": "MED", "pmid": "19181671", "pmcid": "PMC2659225", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC2659225"}, "doi": "10.1074/jbc.m807140200", "title": "Defining the potassium binding region in an apple terpene synthase.", "authorString": "Green S, Squire CJ, Nieuwenhuizen NJ, Baker EN, Laing W.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Green S", "firstName": "Sol", "lastName": "Green", "initials": "S", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "The New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research, Mt.

To identify terpene synthases involved in the production of these volatile sesquiterpenes, we used massive parallel pyrosequencing (RNA-seq) to obtain the transcriptome of the stem trichomes from these plants. This approach resulted initially in the discovery of six sesquiterpene synthase cDNAs from S. lycopersicum and five from S. habrochaites. Searches of other databases and the S. lycopersicum genome resulted in the discovery of two additional sesquiterpene synthases expressed in trichomes. The sesquiterpene synthases from S. lycopersicum and S. habrochaites have high levels of protein identity. Several of them appeared to encode for non-functional proteins. Functional recombinant proteins produced germacrenes, \u03b2-caryophyllene/\u03b1-humulene, viridiflorene and valencene from (E,E)-farnesyl diphosphate. However, the activities of these enzymes do not completely explain the differences in sesquiterpene production between the two tomato plants.

This approach resulted initially in the discovery of six sesquiterpene synthase cDNAs from S. lycopersicum and five from S. habrochaites. Searches of other databases and the S. lycopersicum genome resulted in the discovery of two additional sesquiterpene synthases expressed in trichomes. The sesquiterpene synthases from S. lycopersicum and S. habrochaites have high levels of protein identity. Several of them appeared to encode for non-functional proteins. Functional recombinant proteins produced germacrenes, \u03b2-caryophyllene/\u03b1-humulene, viridiflorene and valencene from (E,E)-farnesyl diphosphate.

However, there are few reports of cell- and tissue-specific analysis in woody perennials. While microdissected tissues are commonly analyzed for gene expression, reports of protein, enzyme activity and metabolite analysis are limited due in part to an inability to amplify these molecules. Conifer stem tissues are organized in regular patterns with xylem, phloem and cortex development controlled by the activity of the cambial zone (CZ). Defense responses of conifer stems against insects and pathogens involve increased accumulation of terpenoids in cortical resin ducts (CRDs) and de novo formation of traumatic resin ducts from CZ initials. These tissues are difficult to isolate for tissue-specific molecular and biochemical characterization and are thus good targets for application of LMD.<h4>Results</h4>We describe robust methods for isolation of individual tissue-types from white spruce (Picea glauca) stems for analysis of RNA, enzyme activity and metabolites. A tangential cryosectioning approach was important for obtaining large quantities of CRD and CZ tissues using LMD. We report differential expression of genes involved in terpenoid metabolism between CRD and CZ tissues and in response to methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Transcript levels of beta-pinene synthase and levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthase were constitutively higher in CRDs, but induction was stronger in CZ in response to MeJA. 3-Carene synthase was more strongly induced in CRDs compared to CZ. A differential induction pattern was observed for 1-deoxyxyulose-5-phosphate synthase, which was up-regulated in CRDs and down-regulated in CZ. We identified terpene synthase enzyme activity in CZ protein extracts and terpenoid metabolites in both CRD and CZ tissues.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Methods are described that allow for analysis of RNA, enzyme activity and terpenoid metabolites in individual tissues isolated by LMD from woody conifer stems. Patterns of gene expression are demonstrated in specific tissues that may be masked in analysis of heterogeneous samples.

Because JA treatment strongly induced emission of linalool and overexpression of LeMTS1 in tomato resulted in increased production of linalool, we propose that LeMTS1 is a genuine linalool synthase.

Volatile terpene compounds, which are important cues for insect pollinator attraction, were studied by dynamic headspace sampling in the major green-fleshed kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) cultivar 'Hayward' and its male pollinator 'Chieftain'. Terpene volatile levels showed a profile dominated by the sesquiterpenes alpha-farnesene and germacrene D. These two compounds were emitted by all floral tissues and could be observed throughout the day, with lower levels at night. The monoterpene (E)-beta-ocimene was also detected in flowers but was emitted predominantly during the day and only from petal tissue. Using a functional genomics approach, two terpene synthase (TPS) genes were isolated from a 'Hayward' petal EST library. Bacterial expression and transient in planta data combined with analysis by enantioselective gas chromatography revealed that one TPS produced primarily (E,E)-alpha-farnesene and small amounts of (E)-beta-ocimene, whereas the second TPS produced primarily (+)-germacrene D. Subcellular localization using GFP fusions showed that both enzymes were localized in the cytoplasm, the site for sesquiterpene production. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that both TPS genes were expressed in the same tissues and at the same times as the corresponding floral volatiles. The results indicate that two genes can account for the major floral sesquiterpene volatiles observed in both male and female A. deliciosa flowers.", "affiliation": "The New Zealand Institute for

ensure pollination. Volatile terpene compounds, which are important cues for insect pollinator attraction, were studied by dynamic headspace sampling in the major green-fleshed kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) cultivar 'Hayward' and its male pollinator 'Chieftain'. Terpene volatile levels showed a profile dominated by the sesquiterpenes alpha-farnesene and germacrene D. These two compounds were emitted by all floral tissues and could be observed throughout the day, with lower levels at night. The monoterpene (E)-beta-ocimene was also detected in flowers but was emitted predominantly during the day and only from petal tissue. Using a functional genomics approach, two terpene synthase (TPS) genes were isolated from a 'Hayward' petal EST library. Bacterial expression and transient in planta data combined with analysis by enantioselective gas chromatography revealed that one TPS produced primarily (E,E)-alpha-farnesene and small amounts of (E)-beta-ocimene, whereas the second TPS produced primarily (+)-germacrene D. Subcellular localization using GFP fusions showed that both enzymes were localized in the cytoplasm, the site for sesquiterpene production. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that both TPS genes were expressed in the same tissues and at the same times as the corresponding floral volatiles. The results indicate that two genes can account for the major floral sesquiterpene volatiles observed in both male and female A. deliciosa flowers.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2718223?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Journal of experimental botany", "authorinfo": ["Nieuwenhuizen NJ", "Wang MY", "Matich AJ", "Green SA", "Chen X", "Yauk YK", "Beuning LL", "Nagegowda DA", "Dudareva N", "Atkinson RG"], "title": "Two terpene synthases are responsible for the major sesquiterpenes emitted from the flowers of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa)."}, "PMC3525583": {"downloaded": false, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "23272109", "source": "MED", "pmid": "23272109", "pmcid": "PMC3525583", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC3525583"}, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0051481", "title": "Suites of terpene synthases explain differential terpenoid production in ginger and turmeric tissues.", "authorString": "Koo HJ, Gang DR.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Koo HJ", "firstName": "Hyun Jo", "lastName": "Koo", "initials": "HJ", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences and Bio5 Institute, The University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, United States of America."}}}, {"fullName": "Gang DR", "firstName": "David R", "lastName": "Gang", "initials": "DR"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["related_data", "supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "12", "volume": "7", "journalIssueId": "1988969", "dateOfPublication": "2012", "monthOfPublication": "0", "yearOfPublication": "2012", "printPublicationDate": "2012-01-01", "journal": {"title": "PloS one", "ISOAbbreviation": "PLoS One", "medlineAbbreviation": "PLoS One", "NLMid": "101285081", "ISSN": "1932-6203", "ESSN": "1932-6203"}}, "pubYear": "2012", "pageInfo": "e51481", "abstractText": "The essential oils of ginger (Zingiber officinale) and turmeric (Curcuma longa) contain a large variety of terpenoids, some of which possess anticancer, antiulcer, and antioxidant properties.

This may arise from diverse functional traits among species. In fact, genetic diversity within species can have similarly large effects. However, studies of intraspecific genetic diversity have used genotypes varying in several complex traits, obscuring the specific phenotypic variation responsible for community-level effects.
